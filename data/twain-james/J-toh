Mrs. Bbeyer of Eastmead, and of ^'Beever 

and Bream/' was a close, though not a cruel 

observer of what went on, as she always said, at 

the other house. A great deal more went on 

there, naturally, than in the great, clean, square 

solitude in which she had practically lived since 

the death of Mr. Beever, who had predeceased 

by three years his friend and partner, the late 

Paul Bream of Bounds, leaving to his only son, 

the little godson of that trusted associate, the 

substantial share of the business in which his 

wonderful widow — she knew and rejoiced that 

she was wonderful — now had a distinct voice. 

Paul Beever, in the bloom of eighteen, had just 

achieved a scramble from Winchester to Oxford: 

it was his mother's design that he should go 

into as many things as possible before coming 

into the Bank. The Bank, the pride of Wilverley, 

the high clear arch of which the two houses 

8 



4  

were the solid pien, was worth an expensive 
education. It was, in the talk of town and 
county, ^* hundreds of years" old, and as incal- 
culably ^^ good " as a subject of so much infallible 
arithmetic could very well be. That it enjoyed 
the services of Mrs. Beever herself was at pres- 
ent enough for her and an ample contentment 
to Paul, who inclined so little to the sedentaiy 
that she foresaw she should some day be as 
anxious at putting him into figures as she had 
in his childhood been easy about putting him 
into breeches. Half the ground moreover was 
held by young Anthony Bream, the actual master 
of Bounds, the son and successor of her husband's 
ooUeague. 

She was a woman indeed of many designs; 
another of which was that on leaving Oxford 
the boy should travel and inform himself: she 
belonged to the generation that regarded a foreign 
tour not as a relief, but as an important charge. 
Still another had for its main feature that on his 
final return he should marry the nicest girl she 
knew: that, too, would be an important charge, 
but it would be a relief to his mother. It would 
do with the question what it was Mrs. Beever*s 
inveterate household practice to do with all 





loose and unarranged objects — it would get it 
out of the way. There would have been diffi- 
culty in saying whether it was a feeling for peace 
or for war, but her constant habit was to lay 
the ground bare for complications that as yet 
at least had never taken place. Her life was 
like a room prepared for a dance: the furniture 
was all against the walls. About the young lady 
in question she was perfectly definite ; the nicest 
girl she knew was Jean Martle, whom she had 
just sent for at Brighton to come and perform 
in that character. The performance was to be 
for the benefit of Paul, whose midsummer return 
was at hand, and in whom the imagination of 
alternatives was to be discouraged from the first 
It was on the whole a comfort to Mra. Beever 
that he had little imagination of anything. 

Jean Martle, condemned to Brighton by a 
father who was Mrs. Beever's second cousin and 
whom the doctors, the great men in London, kept 
there, as this lady opined, because he was too 
precious wholly to lose and too boring often to 
see — Jean Martle would probably some day have 
money and would possibly some day have sense : 
even as regards a favoured candidate this marked 
the extent of Mrs. Beever's somewhat dry expecta- 





tions. They were addressed in a subordinate de- 
gree to the girFs ^ pkying," which was depended 
on to become brilliant, and to her hair, which was 
viewed in the light of a hope that it would with 
the lapse of years grow darker. Wilverley, in 
truth, would never know if she played ill ; but it 
had an old-fashioned prejudice against loud shades 
in the natural covering of the head. One of the 
things his cousin had been invited for was that 
Paul should get used to her eccentric colour — a 
colour of which, on a certain bright Sunday of 
July, Mrs. Beever noted afresh, with some alarm, 
the exaggerated pitch. Her young friend had 
arrived two days before, and now — during the 
elastic interval from church to luncheon — had 
been despatched to Bounds with a message and 
some preliminary warnings. Jean knew ihat she 
should find there a house in some confusion, a 
new-bom little girl, the first, a young mother not 
yet ** up,*' and an odd visitor, somewhat older than 
herself, in the person of Miss Armiger, a school- 
friend of Mrs. Bream, who had made her appear- 
ance a month before that of the child and had 
stayed on, as Mrs. Beever with some emphasis put 
it, ^ right through everything." 
This picture of the situation had filled, after the 





first hour or two, much of the time of the two 
ladies, but it had originallj included for Jean no 
particular portrait of the head of the. family — an 
omission in some degree repaired, however, by the 
chance of Mrs. Beever's having on the Saturday 
morning taken her for a moment into the Bank. 
They had had errands in the town, and Mrs. 
Beever had wished to speak to Mr. Bream, a 
brilliant, joking gentleman, who, instantly suc- 
cumbing to their invasion and turning out a con- 
fidential clerk, had received them in his beautiful 
private room. ^* Shall I like him?" Jean, with 
the sense of a widening circle, had before this 
adventurously asked. ^^Oh, yes, if you notice 
him I*' Mrs. Beever had replied in obedience to 
an odd private prompting to mark him as insig- 
nificant. Later on, at the Bank, the girl noticed 
him enough to feel rather afraid of him: that 
was always with her the foremost result of being 
noticed herself. If Mrs. Beever passed him over, 
this was in part to be accounted for by all that at 
Eastmead was usually taken for granted. The 
queen-mother, as Anthony Bream kept up the 
jest of calling her, would not have found it easy 
to paint offhand a picture of the allied sovereign 
whom she was apt to regard as a somewhat rest-

less yassal. Though he was a dozen years older 
than the happy young prince on whose behalf she 
exercised her regency, she had known him from 
his boyhood, and his strong points and his weak 
were alike an old story to her. 

His house was new — he had on his marriage, 
at a vast expense, made it quite foolishly so. 
His wife and his child were new; new also in 
a marked degree was the young woman who 
had lately taken up her abode with him and 
who had the air of intending to remain till she 
should lose that quality. But Tony himself — 
this had always been his name to her — was 
intensely familiar. Never doubting that he was 
a subject she had mastered, Mrs. Beever had no 
impulse to clear up her view by distributing 
her impressions. These impressions were as 
neatly pigeon-holed as her correspondence and 
her accounts — neatly, at least, save in so far 
as they were besprinkled with the dust of time. 
One of them might have been freely rendered 
into a hint that her young partner was a possi- 
ble source of danger to her own sex. Not to 
her personally, of course; for herself, somehow, 
Mrs. Beever was not of her own sex. If she 
had been a woman — she never thought of heiv 



 9 

self 80 loosely — she would, in spite of her age, 
have doubtless been conscious of peril. She 
now recognised none in life except that of 
Paulas marrying wrong, against which she had 
taken early measures. It would have been a 
misfortune therefore to feel a flaw in a security 
otherwise so fine. Was not perhaps the fact 
that she had a vague sense of exposure for 
Jean Martle a further motive for her not expar 
tiating to that young lady on Anthony Bream? 
If any such sense operated, I hasten to add, it 
operated without Jean^s having mentioned that 
at the Bank he had struck her as formidable. 

Let me not fail equally to declare that Mrs. 
Beever's general suspicion of him, as our sad 
want of signs for shades and degrees condemns 
me to call it, rested on nothing in the nature 
of evidence. If she had ever really uttered it 
she might have been brought up rather short 
on the question of grounds. There were cer- 
tainly, at any rate, no grounds in Tony's hav- 
ing, before church, sent a word over to her on 
the subject of their coming to luncheon. ^^ Dear 
Julia, this morning, is really grand,*' he had 
written. ^^ We've just managed the move to her 
downstairs room, where they've put up a lovely 



10  

bed and where the sight of all her things cheers 
and amuses her, to say nothing of the wide 
immediate outlook at her garden and her own 
corner of the terrace. In short, the waves are 
going down and we're beginning to have our 
meals * regular.' Luncheon may be rather late, 
but do bring over your charming little friend. 
How she lighted up yesterday my musty den! 
There will be another little friend, by-the-way — 
not of mine, but of Rose Arroiger's, the young 
man to whom, as I think you know, she's en- 
gaged to be married. He's just back from 
China and comes down till to-morrow. Our 
Sunday trains are such a bore that, having wired 
him to take the other line, I'm sending to meet 
him at Plumbury." Mrs. Beever had no need 
to reflect on these few lines to be comfortably 
conscious that they summarised the nature of 
her neighbour — down to the *' dashed sociability," 
as she had heard the poor fellow, in sharp re- 
actions, himself call it, that had made him 8crib> 
ble them, and that always made him talk too 
much for a man in what, more than he, she held 
to be a ^position." He was there in his pre- 
mature bustle over his wife's slow recovery; he 
was th^re in his boyish impatience to improvise 



 11 

a feast; he was there in the simplicity with 
which he exposed himself to the depredations, 
to the possible avalanche, of Miss Armiger's 
belongings. He was there moreover in his free- 
handed way of sending six miles for a young 
man from China, and he was most of all there 
in his allusion to the probable lateness of 
luncheon. Many things in these days were new 
at the other house, but nothing was so new as 
the hours of meals. Mrs. Beever had of old re- 
peatedly dined there on the stroke of six. It 
will be seen that, as I began with declaring, she 
kept her finger on the pulse of Bounds*

Whek Jean Martle, arriying with her message, 
was ushered into the hall, it struck her at first as 
empty, and daring the moment that she supposed 
herself in sole possession she perceived it to#be 
showy and indeed rather splendid. Bright, large 
and high, richly decorated and freely used, full 
of ^^ comers" and communications, it evidently 
played equally the part of a place of reunion 
and of a place of transit. It contained so many 
large pictures that if they hadn't looked some- 
how so recent it might have passed for a museum. 
The shaded summer was in it now, and the odour 
of many flowers, as well as the tick from the chim- 
ney-piece of a huge French clock, which Jean rec- 
ognised as modem. The colour of the air, the frank 
floridity, amused and charmed her. It was not till 
the servant had left her that she became aware she 
was not alone — a discovery that soon gave her an 

embarrassed minute. At the other end of the place 

13 



 13 

appeared a young woman in a posture that, with 
interposing objects, had made her escape notice, a 
jroung woman bent low over a table at which she 
seemed to have been writing. Her chair was 
pushed back, her face buried in her extended and 
supported arms, her whole person relaxed and 
abandoned. She had heard neither the swing of 
the muffled door nor anj footfall on the deep car- 
pet, and her attitude denoted a state of mind that 
made the messenger from Eastmead hesitate be- 
tween quickly retreating on tiptoe or still more 
quickly letting her know that she was observed. 
Before Jean could decide her companion looked 
up, then rapidly and confusedly rose. She could 
only be Miss Armiger, and she had been such a 
figure of woe that it was a surprise not to see her 
in tears. She was by no means in tears; but she 
was for an instant extremely blank, an instant 
during which Jean remembered, rather to wonder 
at it, Mrs. Beever's having said of her that one 
really didn't know whether she was awfully plain 
or strikingly handsome. Jean felt that one quite 
did know : she was awfully plain. It may imme- 
diately be mentioned that about the charm of the 
apparition offered meanwhile to her own eyes, 
Rose Armiger had not a particle of doubt : a slim 



14  

fair girl who struck her as a light sketch for some- 
thing larger, a cluster of happy hints, with nothing 
yet quite '^ put in '" but the splendour of the hair 
and the grace of the clothes — clothes that were 
not as the clothes of Wilverley. The reflection of 
these things came back to Jean from a pair of eyes 
as to which she judged that the extreme lightness 
of their grey was what made them so strange as to 
be ugly — a reflection that spread into a sudden 
smile from a wide, full-lipped mouth, whose regu- 
lar office, obviously, was to produce the second 
impression. In a flash of small square white teeth 
this second impression was produced and the am- 
biguity that Mrs. Beever had spoken of lighted 
up — an ambiguity worth all the plain prettiness 
in the world. Yes, one quite did know: Miss 
Armiger was strikingly handsome. It thus took 
her but a few seconds to repudiate every connec- 
tion with the sombre image Jean had just en- 
countered. 

** Excuse my jumping out at you,** she said. 
^^I heard a sound — I was expecting a friend.** 
Jean thought her attitude an odd one for the 
purpose, but hinted a fear of being in that case 
in the way; on which the young lady protested 
that she was delighted to see her, that she had 



 15 

already heard of her, that she guessed who she 
was. **And I daresay you've already heard of 
mer 

Jean shyly confessed to this and, getting away 
from the subject as quickly as possible, produced 
on the spot her formal credentials. 

^ Mrs. Beever sent me over to ask if it*s really 
quite right we should come to luncheon. We 
came out of church before the sermon, because 
of some people who were to go home with us. 
They're with Mrs. Beever now, but she told me to 
come straight across the garden — the short way." 

Miss Armiger continued to smile. 

*^No way ever seems short enough for Mrs. 
Beever ! ** 

There was an intention in this, as Jean faintly 
felt, that was lost upon her; but while she was 
wondering her companion went on — 

'^Did Mrs. Beever direct you to inquire of 
mer' 

Jean hesitated. 

^ Of anyone, I think, who would be here to tell 
me in case Mrs. Bream shouldn't be quite so 
well.'' 

^ She isn't quite so well." 

The younger girl's face showed the flicker of a 



16  

fear of losing her entertainment; on perceiving 
which the elder pursued — 

*^But we shaVt romp or racket — shall we? 
We shall be very quiet." 

** Very, very quiet,** Jean eagerly echoed. 

Her new friend*s smile became a laugh, which 
was followed by the abrupt question: ^^Do you 
mean to be long with Mrs. Beever?** 

** Till her son comes home. You know he's at 
Oxford, and his term soon ends.** 

^*And yours ends with it — you depart as he 
arrives ? ** 

^ Mrs. Beever teUs me I positively sha'n*t,'* said 
Jean. 

**Then you positively won*t Everything is 
done here exactly as Mrs. Beever tells us. Don*t 
you like her son ? " Rose Armiger asked. 

*^ I don*t know yet ; it*s exactly what she wants 
me to find out" 

" Then you'll have to be very clear.'* 

«« But if I find out I don't? " Jean risked. 

" I shall be very sorry for you I " 

^^ I think then it will be the only thing in this 
duck of an old place that I shan't have liked." 

Rose Armiger for a moment rested her eyes on 
her visitor, who was more and more conscious that 





she was strange and yet not, as Jean had always 
supposed strange people to be, disagreeable. 
**Do you like m«f " she unexpectedly inquired. 

^^How can I tell — at the end of three min- 
utes?'* 

^ I can tell — at the end of one ! You must try 
to like me — you must be very kind to me/' Miss 
Armiger declared. Then she added: ^^Do you 
like Mr. Bream?" 

Jean considered ; she felt that she must rise to 
the occasion. **0h, immensely I" At this her 
interlocutress laughed again, and it made her con- 
tinue with more reserve. ** Of course I only saw 
him for five minutes — yesterday at the Bank." 

^ Oh, we know how long you saw him I " Miss 
Armiger exclaimed. ^He has told us all about 
your visit." 

Jean was slightly awe-stricken: this picture 
seemed to include so many people. ^* Whom has 
he told?" 

Her companion had the air of being amused at 
everything she said; but for Jean it was an air 
none the less with a kind of foreign charm in it. 
•*Why, the very first person was of course his 
poor little wife." 

^ Bat I'm not to see her^ am I ? " Jean rather 



18 THB OTHER HOUSB 

eagerly asked, puzzled by the manner of the alia* 
aion and but half suspecting it to be a part of her 
informant's general ease. 

*^ You're not to see her, but even if you were 
she wouldn't hurt you for it," this young lady re- 
plied. *^She understands his friendly way and 
likes above all his beautiful frankness." 

Jean's bewilderment began to look as if she too 
now, as she remembered, understood and liked 
these things. It might have been in confirmation 
of what was in her mind that she presently said : 
^ He told me I might see the wonderful baby. He 
told me he would show it to me himself." 

'' I'm sure he'll be delighted to do that He's 
awfully proud of the wonderful baby." 

^I suppose it's very lovely," Jean remarked 
with growing confidence. 

^Lovely! Do you think babies are ever lovely?** 

Taken aback by this challenge, Jean reflected a 
little ; she found, however, nothing better to say 
than, rather timidly : ** I like dear little children, 
don't you f " 

Bliss Armiger in turn considered. ^Not a bit I" 
she then replied. ^* It would be very sweet and 
attractive of me to say I adore them ; but I never 
pretend to feelings I can't keep up, don't you 



 19 

know? If you'd like, all the same, to see Effie,*' 
she obligingly added, ^ I'll so far sacrifice myself 
as to get her for you ? " 

Jean smiled as if this pleasantry were conta- 
gious. " You won't sacrifice her f " 

Rose Armiger stared. ^^ I won't destroy her." 

** Then do get her." 

*• Not yet, not yet I " cried another voice — that 
of Mrs. Beever, who had just been introduced and 
who, having heard the last words of the two girls, 
came, accompanied by the servant, down the hall. 
** The baby's of no importance. We've come over 
for the mother. Is it true that Julia has had a bad 
turn?" she asked of Rose Armiger. 

Miss Armiger had a peculiar way of looking at a 
person before speaking, and she now, with this 
tranquillity, delayed so long to answer Mrs. Beever 
that Jean also rested her eyes, as if for a reason, on 
the good lady from Eastmead. She g^atly ad- 
mired her, but in that instant, the first of seeing 
her at Bounds, she perceived once for all how the 
difference of the setting made another thing of 
the gem. Short and solid, with rounded corners 
and full supports, her hair very black and very 
flat, her eyes very small for the amount of expres- 
sion they could show, Mrs. Beever was so ^^ early 



20 THE OTHEB HOUSB 

Victorian *' as to be almost prehistoric — was con- 
structed to move amid massive mahogany and sit 
upon banks of Berlin-wooL She was like an odd 
volume, ^ sensibly " bound, of some old magazine. 
Jean knew that the great social event of her 
younger years had been her going to a fancy-ball 
in the character of an Andalusian, an incident of 
which she still carried a memento in the shape of a 
hideous fan. Jean was so constituted that she also 
knew, more dimly but at the end of five minutes, 
that the elegance at Mr. Bream's was slightly pro- 
vincial. It made none the less a medium in which 
Mrs. Beever looked superlatively local. That in- 
deed in turn caused Jean to think the old place 
still more of a ^* duck.'' 

^^ I believe our poor friend feels rather down," 
Miss Armiger finally brought out. ^* But I don't 
imagine it's of the least consequence," she im- 
mediately added. 

The contrary of this was, however, in soma 
degree foreshadowed in a speech directed to Jean 
by the footman who had admitted her. He re- 
ported Mr. Bream as having been in his wife's 
room for nearly an hour, and Dr. Ramage as having 
arrived some time before and not yet come out. 
Mrs. Beever decreed, upon this news, that they 



THS OTHER HOUSE 21 

must drop their idea of lunching and that Jean 
most go straight back to the friends who had been 
left at the other house. It was these friends who 
on the way from church had mentioned their hav- 
ing got wind of the rumour — the quick circula- 
tion of which testified to the compactness of Wil- 
Tarley — that there had been a sudden change 
in Mrs. Bream since the hour at which her hus- 
band's note was written. Mrs. Beever dismissed 
her companion to Eastmead with a message for her 
▼isitors. Jean was to entertain them there in her 
stead and to understand that she might return to 
loncheon only in case of being sent for. At the 
door the girl paused and exclaimed rather wistfully 
to Rose Armiger : ** Well, then, give her my love I " 



ni 



^ YoxTB young friend,'* Rose commented, ^ is as 
a£fectionate as she's pretty : sending her love to 
people she has never seen I" 

^^She only meant the little girl. I think it's 
rather nice of her," said Mrs. Beever. *^ Jfy inter- 
est in these anxieties is always confined to the 
mamma. I thought we were going so straight." 

^*I daresay we are," Miss Armiger replied. 
^ But Nurse told me an hour ago that I'm not to 
see her at all this morning. It will be the first 
morning for several days." 

Mrs. Beever was silent a little. ^ You've en- 
joyed a privilege altogether denied to m^." 

^ Ah, you must remember," said Rose, ^ that Fm 
Julia's oldest friend. That's always the way she 
treats me." 

Mrs. Beever assented. ** Familiarly, of course. 
Well, you're not mine; but that's the way / 
treat you too," she went on. ^You must wait 



THE OTHEB H0TJ8B 28 

with me here for more news, and be as still as 
a mouse/' 

^* Dear Mrs. Beever/' the girl protested, *^ I never 
made a noise in all my life I " 

"You will some day — you're so clever," Mrs. 
Beever said. 

"I'm clever enough to be quiet." Then Rose 
added, less gaily : " I'm the one thing of her own 
that dear Julia has ever had." 

Mrs. Beever threw back her head. " Don't you 
count her husband ? " 

" I count Tony immensely ; but in another way." 

Again Mrs. Beever considered : she might have 
been wondering in what way even so expert a 
young person as this could count Anthony Bream 
except as a treasure to his wife. But what she 
presently articulated was: "Do you call him 
*Tony' to himself?" 

Miss Armiger met her question this time 
promptly. "He has asked me to — and to do it 
even to Julia. Don't be afraid I " she exclaimed ; 
" I know my place, and I sha'n't go too far. Of 
course he's everjrthing to her now," she continued, 
"and the child is already almost as much; but 
what I mean is that if he counts for a great deal 
more, I, at least, go back a good deal further. 



24  

Though I'm three years older, we were brought 
together as girls by one of the strongest of all ties 
— the tie of a common aversion." 

**0h, I know your common aversion I" Mrs. 
Beever spoke with her air of general competence. 

*^ Perhaps, then, you know that her detestable 
step-mother was, very little to my credit, my aunt. 
If her father, that is, was Mrs. Grantham's second 
husband, my uncle, my mother's brother, had been 
the first. Julia lost her mother; I lost both my 
mother and my father. Then Mrs. Grantham 
took me : she had shortly before made her second 
marriage. She put me at the horrid school at 
Weymouth at which she had already put her 
step-daughter.'* 

** You ought to be obliged to her,*' Mrs. Beever 
suggested, '*for having made you acquainted." 

^*We are — we've never ceased to be. It was 
as if she had made us sisters, with the delightful 
position for me of the elder, the protecting one. 
But it's the only good turn she has ever dona 
us." 

Mrs. Beever weighed this statement with her 
alternative, her business nuinner. ^*Is she really 
then such a monster ? " 

Rose Armiger had a melancholy headshake. 



 25 

^^Don*t ask me aboat her — I dislike her too 
much, perhaps, to be strictly fair. For me, how- 
ever, I daresay, it didn't matter so much that she 
was narrow and hard: I wasn't an easy victim 
— I could take care of myself, I could fight. 
But Julia bowed her head and suffered. Never 
was a marriage more of a rescue.'* 

Mrs. Beever took this in with unsuspended 
criticism. ^And yet Mrs. Grantham travelled 
all the way down from town the other day sim- 
ply to make her a visit of a couple of hours." 
That wasn't a kindness," the girl returned; 

it viras an injury, and I believe — certainly 
Julia believes — that it was a calculated one. 
Mrs. Grantham knew perfectly the effect she 
would have, and she triumphantly had it. She 
came, she said, at the particular crisis, to ^make 
peace.' Why couldn't she let the poor dear 
alone? She only stirred up the wretched past 
and reopened old wounds." 

For answer to this Mrs. Beever remarked with 
some irrelevancy: ^*She abused tfou a good deal, 
I think." 

Her companion smiled frankly. ^^ Shockingly, 
I believe; but that's of no importance to me. 
She doesn't touch me or reach me now."

26 THE OTHBB HOUSE 

**Your description of her«" said Mrs. Beever, 
^^is a description of a monstrous bad woman. 
And yet she appears to have got two honour- 
able men to give her the last proof of confi* 
dence." 

^^My poor uncle utterly withdrew his confi- 
dence when he saw her as she was. She killed 
him — he died of his horror of her. As for 
Julia's father, he's honourable if you like, but 
he's a mu£F. He's afraid of his wife." 

** And her * taking ' you, as you say, who were 
no real relation to her — her looking after you 
and putting you at school: wasn't that," Mrs. 
Beever propounded, *^a kindness?" 

**She took me to torment me — or at least to 
make me feel her hand. She has an absolute 
necessity to do that — it was what brought her 
down here the other day." 

*^Tou make out a wonderful case," said Mrs. 
Beever, *^and if ever I'm put on my trial for a 
crime — say for muddling the affairs of the Bank 
— I hope I shall be defended by someone with 
your gift and your manner. I don't wonder," 
she blandly pursued, **that your friends, even 
the blameless ones, like this dear pair, cling to 
you as they do." 



THB OTHER HOUSE 27 

^*If you mean you don't wonder I stay on 
here so long/' said Rose good-humouredly, ^^Fm 
greatly obliged to you for your sympathy. 
Julia's the one thing I have of my own." 

^ Tou make light of our husbands and lovers I *' 
laughed Mrs. Beever. ^* Haven't I had the pleasure 
of hearing of a gentleman to whom you're soon to 
be married?" 

Rose Armiger opened her eyes — there was per- 
haps a slight affectation in it. She looked, at any 
rate, as if she had to make a certain effort to meet 
the allusion. ^' Dennis Vidal? " she then asked. 

** Why, are there more than one ? " Mrs. Beever 
cried ; after which, as the girl, who had coloured 
a little, hesitated in a way that almost suggested 
alternatives, she added: ^ Isn't it a definite en- 
gagement?" 

Rose Armiger looked round at the clock. *^Mr. 
Vidal will be here this morning. Ask him how he 
considers it." 

One of the doors of the hall at this moment 
opened, and Mrs. Beever exclaimed with some 
eagerness, ^ Here he is, perhaps I " Her eagerness 
was characteristic ; it was part of a comprehensive 
vision in which the pieces had already fallen into 
sharp adjustment to each other. The young lady 



28 THE OTHBB HOTJ8B 

she had been talking with had in these few minutes, 
for some reason, struck her more forcibly than ever 
before as a possible object of interest to a youth of 
a candour greater even than any it was incumbent 
on a respectable mother to cultivate. Miss Armiger 
had just given her a glimpse of the way she could 
handle honest gentlemen as **mufEs.'' She was 
decidedly too unusual to be left out of account. If 
there was the least danger of Paul's falling in love 
with her it ought somehow to be arranged that her 
marriage should encounter no diflSculty. 

The person now appearing, however, proved to 
be only Doctor Ramage, who, having a substantial 
wife of his own, was peculiarly unfitted to promise 
relief to Mrs. Beever's anxiety. He was a little 
man who moved, with a warning air, on tiptoe, as 
if he were playing some drawing-room game of 
surprises, and who had a face so candid and cir> 
cular that it suggested a large white pill. Mrs. 
Beever had once said with regard to sending for 
him: ^*It isn't to take his medicine, it's to take 
him. I take him twice a week in a cup of tea.'* 
It was his tone that did her good. He had in his 
hand a sheet of note-paper, one side of which was 
covered with writing and with which he immedi- 
ately addressed himself to Miss Armiger. It was 



THB OTHE& HOUSE 29 

a prescription to be made up, and he begged her to 
see that it was carried on the spot to the chemist's, 
mentioning that on leaving Mrs. Bream's room he 
had gone straight to the library to think it out. 
Rose, who appeared to recognise at a glance its 
nature, replied that as she was fidgety and wanted 
a walk she would perform the errand herself. Her 
bonnet and jacket were there ; she had put them 
on to go to church, and then, on second thoughts, 
seeing Mr. Bream give it up, had taken them 
o£F. 

** Excellent for you to go yourself," said the 
Doctor. He had an instruction to add, to which, 
lucid and prompt, already equipped, she gave full 
attention* As she took the paper from him he 
subjoined: '^You're a very nice, sharp, obliging 
person." 

^ She knows what she's about I " said Mrs. Bee- 
ver with much expression. ^^But what in the 
world is Julia about?" 

^ I'll tell you when I know, my dear lady." 

^ Is there really anything wrong ? " 

** I'm waiting to find out." 

Miss Armiger, before leaving them, was wait- 
ing too. She had been checked on the way to 
the door by Mrs. Beever's question, and she stood 



80 THE OTHSB H0U8B 

there with her intensely clear eyes on Doctor 
Ramage^s face. 

Mrs. Beever continued to study it as earnestly. 

**Then you're not going yet?" 

**By no means, though I've another pressing 
call. I must have that thing £rom you firati" he 
said to Rose. 

She went to the door, but there again she 
paused. 

""Is Mr. Broam still with her?** 

^Very much with her — that's why Fm here. 
She made a particular request to be left for five 
minutes alone with him.** 

**So Nurse isn't there either?*' Rose asked. 

^ Nurse has embraced the occasion to pop down 
for her lunch. Mrs. Bream has taken it into her 
head that she has something very important to say.** 

Mrs. Beever firmly seated heiself. 

**And pray what may that be?** 

^She turned me out of the room precisely ao 
that I shouldn't leam.'* 

^ I think I know what it is," their companion^ 
at the door, put in. 

^Then what is it?'* Mrs. Beever demanded. 

""Oh, I wouldn't tell you for the world I** 
And with this Rose Armiger departed. 



IV 



Left alone with the lady of Eastmead, Doctor 
Ramage studied his watch a little absently. 
**Our yonng friend's exceedingly nervous.'* 

Mrs. Beever glanced in the direction in which 
Rose had disappeared. *^ Do you allude to that 
girl?" 

^ I allude to dear Mrs. Tony." 

**It'8 equally true of Miss Armiger: she's as 
worried as a pea on a pan. Julia, as far as that 
goes," Mrs. Beeyer continued, *^can never have 
been a person to hold herself together." 

^Precisely — she requires to be held. Well, 
happily she has Tony to hold her." 

**" Then he's not himself in one of his states ? " 

Dr. Ramage hesitated. *^I don't quite make 
him out. He seems to have fifty things at once 
in his head." 

Mrs. Beever looked at the Doctor hard* 

''When does he ever not have? But I had a 

81 



82 THE OTEDEB HOUSE 

note from him only this morning — in the highest 
spirits." 

Doctor Ramage's little eyes told nothing hut 
what he wanted. ^^Well, whatever happens to 
him, hell luckily always have them!^* 

Mrs. Beever, at this, jimiped up. ** Robert 
Ramage,'* she earnestly demanded, *^what if to 
happen to that boy?'* 

Before he had time to reply there rang oat a 
sudden sound which had, oddly, much of the efiFect 
of an answer and which caused them both to start. 
It was the near vibration, from Mrs. Bream's 
room, of one of the smart, loud electric beUs which 
were for Mrs. Beever the rery roioe of the new- 
ness of Bounds. They waited an instant ; then 
the Doctor said quietly: ^^It's for Nurse I** 

^ It's not for jfouf " The beU sounded again •• 
she spoke. 

**It's for Nurse," Doctor Ramage repeated^ 
moving nevertheless to the door he had come in 
by. He paused again to listen, and the door, the 
next moment thrown open, gave passage to a taU, 
good-looking young man, dressed as if, with mook 
freshness, for church and wearing a large orchid 
in his buttonhole. ** Tou rang for Nurse? '* the 
Doctor immediately said.

The young man stood looking from one of his 
friends to the other. ^^ She's there — it's all right. 

But ah, my dear people 1 " And he passed 

his hand, with the vivid gesture of brushing away 
an image, over a face of which the essential ra- 
diance was yisible even through perturbation. 

*^ How's Julia now?" Mrs. Beever asked. 

**Much relieved, she tells me, at having 
spoken. " 

Spoken of what, Tony?" 
Of everything she can think of that's incon- 
ceivable — that's damnable." 

^If I hadn't known that she wanted to do 
exactly that," said the Doctor, ** I wouldn't have 
given her the opportunity." 

Mrs. Beever's eyes sounded her colleague of 
the Bank. *^ You're upset, my poor boy — you're 
in one of your great states. Something painful 
to you has taken place." 

Tony Bream paid no attention to this remark ; 
all his attention was for his other visitor, who 
stood with one hand on the door of the hall 
and an open watch, on which he still placidly 
gazed, in the other. ** Ramage," the young man 
suddenly broke out, **are you keeping some- 
back ? Isn't she safe ? " 



84  

The good Doctor's small, neat face seemed to 
grow more smoothly globular. *^The dear lady 
is convinced, you mean, that her very last hoar 
is at hand?" 

^^ So much so," Tony replied, *^ that if she got 
you and Nurse away, if she made me kneel down 
by her bed and take her two hands in mine, wh&t 
do you suppose it was to say to me?" 

Doctor Ramage beamed. ^^ Why, of course, that 
she's going to perish in her flower. I've been 
through it so often I " he said to Mrs. Beever. 

** Before, but not after," that lady lucidly re- 
joined. ^^She has had her chance of perishing, 
but now it's too late." 

«« Doctor," said Tony Bream, **fi my wife 
going to die?" 

His friend hesitated a moment. ^*When a 
lady's only symptom of that tendency is the 
charming volubility with which she dilates upon 
it, that's very well as far as it goes. But it's not 
quite enough." 

She says she knawM it," Tony returned. 
But you surely know more than she, don't 
you?" 

«« I know everything that can be known. I know 
that when, in certain conditions, pretty young 



(4 



THB OTHEB HOUSE 86 

mothen have acquitted themselves of that inevi- 
table declarationi they turn over and go comfort- 
ably to sleep." 

"That's exactly," said Tony, "what Nurse must 
make her do." 

"It's exactly what she's doing." Doctor Ram- 
age had no sooner spoken than Mrs. Bream's bell 
sounded for the third time. " Excuse me I " he 
imperturbably added. "Nurse calls me." 

"And doesn't she call m^/" cried Tony. 

"Not in the least." The doctor raised his 
hand with instant authority. "Stay where you 
are I " With this he went off to his patient. 

If Mrs. Beever often produced, with prompti- 
tude, her theory that the young banker was 
subject to "states," this habit, of which he was 
admirably tolerant, was erected on the sense of 
something in him of which even a passing ob- 
server might have caught a glimpse. A woman 
of still more wit than Mrs. Beever, whom he 
had met on the threshold of life, once explained 
some accident to him by the words : " The reason 
IS, you know, that you're so exaggerated." This 
had not been a manner of saying that he was 
inclined to overshoot the truth; it had been an 
attempt to express a certain quality of passive 



86 THB OTHER HOU8B 

excess which was the note of the whole man, 
and which, for an attentive eye, began with hia 
neckties and ended with his intonations. To 
look at him was immediately to see that he 
was a collection of gifts, which presented them- 
selves as such precisely by having in each case 
slightly overflowed the measure. He could do 
things — this was all he knew about them; and 
he was ready-made, as it were — he had not had 
to put himself together. His dress was just 
too fine, his colour just too high, his moustache 
just too long, his voice just too loud, his smile 
just too gay. His movement, his manner, his 
tone were respectively just too free, too easy, 
and too familiar; his being a very handsome, 
happy, clever, active, ambitiously local young 
man was in short just too obvious. But the 
result of it all was a presence that was in it- 
self a close contact, the air of immediate, un- 
conscious, unstinted life and of his doing what 
he liked and liking to please. One of his 
^* states,** for Mrs. Beever, was the state of his 
being a boy again, and the sig^ of it was his talk- 
ing nonsense. It was not an example of that 
tendency, but she noted it almost as if it were, 
that almost as soon as the Doctor had left them 



THE OTHIBB HOXT8E 87 

he asked her if she had not brought over that 
awfully pretty girl. 

**She has been here, but I sent her home 
again." Then his visitor added: ^Does she 
strike you as awfully pretty?" 

^As pretty as a pretty song! I took a tre- 
mendous notion to her." 

**She*s only a child — for mercy's sake don't 
show your notion too much I " Mrs. Beever 
ejaculated. 

Tony Bream gave his bright stare ; after which, 
with his still brighter alacrity, *^I see what you 
mean : of course I won't I " he declared. Then, 
as if candidly and conscientiously wondering: 
^ Is it showing it too much to hope she'll come 
back to luncheon?" 

** Decidedly — if Julia's so down." 

" That's only too much for Julia — not for Aer," 
Tony said with his nervous smile. ^^But Julia 
knows about her, hopes she's coming, and wants 
everything to be natural and pleasant." He 
passed his hand over his eyes again, and as if at 
the same time recognising that his tone required 
explanation, ^^It's just beeaute Julia's so down, 
don't you see ? " he subjoined. ^ A fellow can't 
stand it." 



88 THE OTHSB HOVSB 

Mrs. Beever spoke after a pause during 
her companion roamed rather jerkily about. 

^ It's a mere accidental fluctuation. Ton may 
trust Ramage to know." 

^^Tes, thank God, I may trust Ramage to 
know I " He had the accent of a man constitu- 
tionally accessible to suggestion, and could turn 
the next instant to a quarter more cheering. ** Do 
you happen to know what has become of Rose ? '* 

Again Mrs. Beeyer, making a fresh observation, 
waited a little before answering. ** Do you now 
call her 'Rose'?" 

''Dear, yes — talking with Julia. And with 
A«r," he went on as if he couldn't quite remember 
— "do I too? Tes," he recollected, "I think I 
must." 

" What one must one must," said Mrs. Beeyer 
dryly. "'Rose/ then, has gone over to the 
chemist's for the Doctor." 

" How jolly of her I " Tony exclaimed. " She*8 
a tremendous comfort." 

Mrs. Beever committed herself to no opinion on 
this point, but it was doubtless on account of the 
continuity of the question that she presently 
asked : " Who's this person who's coming to-day 
to marry her?" 



THB OTHER HOUSE 89 

** A very good fellow, I believe — and * rising ' : 
a olerk in some Eastern house." 

** And why hasn't he come sooner ? " 

^^ Because he has been at Hong Kong, or some 
such place, trying hard to pick up an income. 
He's *poor but pushing,' she says. They've no 
means but her own two hundred." 

*^Two hundred a year? That's quite enough 
for them I " Mrs. Beever opined. 

^ Then you had better tell him so I " laughed 
Tony. 

^ I hope youll back me up I " she returned ; 
after which, before he had time to speak, she 
broke out with irrelevance: ^^How is it she 
knows what Julia wanted to say to you ? " 

Tony, surprised, looked vague. ^^Just now? 
J)oe9 she know? — I haven't the least idea." 
Rose appeared at this moment behind the glass 
doors of the vestibule, and he added, ^^Here 
she is." 

"Then you can ask her." 

" Easily," said Tony. But when the girl came 
in he greeted her only with a lively word of 
thanks for the service she had just rendered ; so 
that the lady of Eastmead, after waiting a minute, 
took the line of assuming, with a certain visible 



40  

rigour, that he might have a reason for making 
his inquiry without an auditor. Taking tempo- 
rary leave of him, she mentioned the visitors at 
home whom she must not forget. ^*Then you 
won't come hack ? *' he asked. 
•* Yes, in an hour or two." 
^^ And bring Miss What's-her-name ? '' 
As Mrs. Beever failed to respond to this, Rose 
Armiger added her voice. ^ Yes — do bring Miss 
What*8-her-name." Mrs. Beever, without assent- 
ing, reached the door, which Tony had opened for 
her. Here she paused long enough to be over- 
taken by the rest of the girl's appeal. ** I delight 
so in her clothes." 

*^ I delight so in her hair I " Tony laughed. 
Mrs. Beever looked from one of them to the 
other. ** Don't you think you've delight enough 
with what your lituation here already offers?" 
She departed with the private determination to 
return unaccompanied. 



Thbbb minutes later Tony Bream put his ques- 
tion to his other visitor* **Is it true that you 
know what Julia a while ago had the room 
cleared in order to say to me?" 

Rose hesitated. ^^ Mrs. Beever repeated to you 
that I told her so? — Tes, then; I probably do 
know." She waited again a little. ^^The poor 
darling announced to you her conviction that 
she's dying." Then at the face with which he 
greeted her exactitude : ** I haven't needed to be 
a monster of cunning to guess I " she exclaimed. 

He had perceptibly paled : it made a difference, 
a kind of importance for that absurdity that it 
was already in other ears. *^She has said the 
same to ycm/" 

Rose gave a pitying smile. ** She has done me 
that honour." 

**Do you mean tcxJay?" 

••T<Hlay — and once before." 

41 



42 THX OTHBB HOUaS 

Tony looked simple in his wonder. ^Testei^ 
day?'' 

Rose hesitated again. ^ No ; before your child 
was bom. Soon after I came." 

^She had made up her mind then from the 
first?" 

*^ Tes," said Rose, with the serenity of superior 
sense ; **she had laid out for herself that pleasant 
little prospect. She called it a presentiment, a 
fixed idea." 

Tony took this in with a frown. ^And yoa 
never spoke of it?" 

** To you ? Why in the world tAotcU I — when 
she herself didn^t ? I took it perfectly for what 
it was — an inevitable but unimportant result of 
the nervous depression produced by her step- 
mother's visit." 

Tony had fidgeted away with his hands in the 
pockets of his trousers. **Damn her step-mother's 
visiti" 

«' That's exactly what I did!" Rose laughed. 

*^ Damn her step-mother too I " the young man 
angrily pursued. 

^ Hush!" said the giii, soothingly: ^we mustn^t 
curse our relations before the Doctor!" Doctor 
Ramage had come back from his patient, and she 



 48 

mentioned to him that the medicine for which she 
had gone ont would immediately be delivered. 

**Many thanks/' he replied: ^^1*11 pick it up 
myself. I muH run out — to another case." 
Then with a friendly hand to Tony and a nod 
at the room he had quitted : ** Things are quief 

Tony, gratefully grasping his hand, detained 
him by it ** And what was that loud ring that 
called you ? " 

** A stupid flurry of Nurse. I was ashamed of 
her.'' 

^Then why did you stay so long? " 

**To hare it out with your wife. She wants 
you again." 

Tony eagerly dropped his hand. ^Then I 

gor 

The Doctor raised his liberated member. ^*In 
a quarter of an hour — not before. I'm most 
reluctant, but I allow her fire minutes." 

**It may make her easier afterwards," Rose 
obsenred. 

** Thai's precisely the ground of my giving in. 
Take care, you know; Nurse wUl time you," 
Doctor Ramage said to Tony. 

**So many thanks. And you'll come back ? " 

^ The moment I'm free." 



44 THE OTHSB HOUSB 

When he had gone Tony stood there sombre* 
^She irants to say it again — that*s what she 
wants.*' 

** Well," Rose answered, ^* the more she says it, 
the less it's true. It's not she who decides it." 

•" No," Tony brooded ; '' it's not she. Bat it^s 
not you and I either," he soon went on. 

** It's not even the Doctor," Rose remarked with 
her conscious irony. 

Her companion rested his troubled eyes on her. 
^And yet he's as worried as if it were." She 
protested against this imputation with a word to 
which he paid no heed. ^If anything should 
happen" — and his eyes seemed to go as far as 
his thought — ^^what on earth would become of 
me?" 

The girl looked down, veiy gxare. ** Men have 
borne such things." 

**Veiy badly — the real ones." He seemed to 
lose himself in the effort to embrace the wont, 
to think it out **What should I do? where 
should I turn?" 

She was silent a little. **Tou ask me toe 
much I" she helplessly sighed. 

^ Don't say that," replied Tony, ^ at a moment 
when I know so little if I mayn't hare to ask 



THE OTHER HOUBE 45 

you still moiel** This exolamation made her 
meet his eyes with a turn of her own that might 
have struck him had he not been following an- 
other train. **To you I can say it, Rose — she's 
inexpressibly dear to me." 

She showed him a &ce intensely receptive. 
^It's for your affection for her that I've really 
given you mine." Then she shook her head — 
seemed to shake out, like the overflow of a cup, 
her generous smile. *^But be easy. We shaVt 
have loved her so much only to lose her." 

** 111 be hanged if we shall I " Tony responded. 
'^And such talk's a vile false note in the midst 
of a joy like yours." 

** Like mine?" Sose exhibited some vagueness. 

Her companion was already accessible to the 
amusement of it. *^I hope that's not tiie way 
you mean to look at Mr. Vidal I " 

** Ah, Mr. Vidal I " she ambiguously munnured. 

MSha'n't you then be glad to see him?" 

•« Intensely glad. But how shall I say it?" 
She thought a moment and then went on as if 
die found the answer to her question in Tony's 
exceptional intelligence and their comfortable ii^ 
tbnacj. ^There's gladness and gladness. It isn't 
k»vs*s young drecun ; it's rather an old and rather

a sad story. WeVe worried and waited — weVe 
been acquainted with grief. WeVe oome together 
a weary way." 

*^ I know you*ye had a horrid grind. Bat isn't 
this the end of it?" 

Rose hesitated. ** That's just what he's to 
settle." 

^^ Happily, I seel Just look at him." 

The glass doors, as Tony spoke, had been 
thrown open by the butler. The young man 
from China was there — a short, meagre young 
man, with a smooth face and a dark blue double- 
breasted jacket. **Mr. Vidal!" the butler an- 
nounced, withdrawing again, while the visitor, 
whose entrance had been rapid, suddenly and 
shyly faltered at the sight of his host His 
pause, however, lasted but just long enough to 
enable Rose to bridge it over with the frankest 
maidenly grace; and Tony's quick sense of being 
out of place at this reunion was not a bar to 
the impression of her charming, instant action, 
her soft ^Dennis, Dennis!" her light, fluttered 
arms, her tenderly bent head, and the short, bright 
stillness of her clasp of her lover. Tony shone 
down at them with the pleasure of having helped 
them, and the warmth of it was in his immediate 



 47 

grasp of the traveller's hand. He cut short his 
embarrassed thanks — he was too delighted; and 
leaying him with the remark that he would pres- 
ently come back to show him his room, he went 
off again to poor Julia.

Denkib VroAL, when the door had dosed on 
his host, drew again to his breast the girl to 
whom he was plighted, and pressed her there 
with silent joy. She softly submitted, then still 
more softly diseng^ltged herself, though in his 
flushed firmness he but partly released her. The 
light of admiration was in his hard young hce 
— a visible tribute to what she showed again his 
disaccustomed eyes. Holding her yet, he covered 
her with a smile that produced two strong bat 
relenting lines on either side of his dxy, thin 
lips. **My own dearest,** he murmured, **you*re 
still more so than one remembered I ** 

She opened her clear eyes wider. ^ Still more 
what?" 

** Still more of a fright I** And he kissed her 
again. 

** It*s you that are wonderful, Dennis,** she said : 
^ you look so absurdly young.*

He felt with his lean, fine, brown hand his 
spare, clean, brown chin. ** If I looked as old as 
I feel, dear girl, they'd have my portrait in the 
illustrated papers." 

He had now drawn her down upon the nearest 
sofa, and while he sat sidewajrs, (^rasping the 
wrist of which he remained in possession after she 
had liberated her fingers, she leaned back and 
took him in with a deep air of her own. ^^ And 
yet it's not that you're exactly childish — or so 
extraordinarily fresh," she went on as if to puzzle 
out, for her satisfaction, her impression of him. 

*** Fresh,' my dear girl I" He gave a little 
happy jeer; then he raised her wrist to his mouth 
and held it there as long as she would let him, 
looking at her hard. ^ Tha£% the freshest thing 
Fve ever been conscious of I " he exclaimed as she 
drew away her hand and folded her arms. 

** You're worn, but you're not wasted," she 
brought out in her kind but considering way. 
•* You're awfuUy well, you know." 

"Yes, I'm awfully well, I know" — he spoke 
with just the faintest ring of impatience. Then 
he added: "Your yoice, all the while, has been 
in my ears. But there's something you put into 
it that ihey — out there, stupid things ! — couldn't. 



50 THE OTHER HOUSB 

Don*t * size me up * so/* he continuecU smiling ; 
«^you make me nervous about what I may seem 
to come to!** 

They had both shown shyness, but Rose's was 
already gone. She kept her inclined position and 
her folded arms; supported by the back of the 
sofa, her head preserved, toward the side on which 
he sat, its charming contemplative turn. ^^Fm 
only thinking," she said, ^^that you look young 
just as a steel instrument of the best quality, 
no matter how much it*s handled, often looks 
new." 

^^ Ah, if you mean Fm kept bright by use ^-— I " 
the young man laughed. 

" You're polished by life." 

" * Polished ' is delightful of you I " 

*^ Fm not sure youVe come back handsomer than 
you went," said Rose, ^ and I don't know if you've 
come back richer." 

^Then let me immediately tell you I Kave!^ 
Vidal broke in. 

She received the announcement, for a minute, 
in silence : a good deal more passed between this 
pair than they uttered. ^^What I was going to 
say," she then quietly resumed, ^*is that I'm 
awfully pleased with myself when I see that at 



 51 

ftny rate you're — what shall I call you ? — a made 
man." 

Vidal frowned a little through his happiness. 
**With * yourself'? Aren't you a little pleased 
with met'' 

She hesitated. *^With myself first, because I 
was sure of you first." 

** Do you mean before I was of j/auf — I'm some* 
how not sure of you yet I " the young man 
declared. 

Rose coloured slightly ; but she gaily laughed. 
** Then I'm ahead of you in everything I " 

Leaning toward her with all his intensified need 
of her and holding, by his extended arm, the top 
of the sofa-back, he worried with his other hand 
a piece of her dress, which he had begun to finger 
for want of something more responsive. ^^ You're 
as far beyond me still as all the distance I've 
come." He had dropped his eyes upon the 
crumple he made in her frock, and her own dur- 
ing that moment, from her superior height, de* 
scended upon him with a kind of unseen appeal. 
When he looked up again it was gone. *^ What 
do you mean by a * made ' man ? " he asked. 

^ Oh, not the usual thing, but the real thing. 
A man one needn't worry about." 



52 THE OTHXB HOUBX 

*^ Thank you I The man not worried about is 
the man who muffs it.** 

**That*8 a horrid selfish speech,** said Roee 
Armiger. ** You don*t deserve I should tell you 
what a success I now feel that you'll be«** 

«« WelU darling,** Vidal answered, "^ that matten 
the less as I know exactly the occasion on which 
I shall fully feel it for myself.** 

Rose manifested no further sense of this occa- 
sion than to go straight on with her idea. She 
placed her arm with frank friendship on his 
shoulder. It drew him closer, and he recovered 
his grasp of her free hand. With his want of 
stature and presence, his upward look at her, his 
small, smooth head, his seasoned sallowness and 
simple eyes, he might at this instant have struck 
a spectator as a figure actually younger and 
slighter than the ample, accomplished girl whoee 
gesture protected and even a little patronised 
him. But in her vision of him she none the leas 
clearly found f uU warrant for saying, instead of 
something he expected, something she wished and 
had her reasons for wishing, even if they repre- 
sented but the gain of a minute*s time. ** Tou*re 
not splendid, my dear old Dennis — you're not 
daaling, nor dangerous, nor even exactly disttn-

gnished. Bat youVe a qoiet little something 
that the tiresome time has made perfect, and that 
— just here where youVe come to me at last — 
makes me immensely proud of you I *' 

She had, with this, so far again surrendered her- 
self that he could show her in the wajrs he pre- 
ferred how such a declaration touched him. The 
place in which he had come to her at last was of 
a nature to cause him to look about at it, just as 
to begin to inquire was to learn from her that 
he had dropped upon a crisis. He had seen Mrs. 
Bream, under Rose's wing, in her maiden days; 
bat in his eagerness to jump at a meeting with 
the only woman really important to him he 
had perhaps intruded more than he supposed. 
Though he expressed again the liveliest sense of 
the kindness of these good people, he was unable 
to conceal his disappointment at finding their 
inmate agitated also by something quite distinct 
from the joy of his arrival. *^Do you really 
think the poor lady will spoil our fun?*' he rather 
resentfully put it to her. 

*^ It will depend on what our fun may demand 
of her,** said Rose. *^If you ask me if she's in 
danger, I think not quite that : in such a case I 
must certainly have put you off. I daresay to^y

show the contrary. But she's so much to me 
— yoa know haw much — that Fm iineasj, qaicklj 
upset; and if I seem to you flustered and not my- 
self and not tnth you, I beg you to attribute it 
simply to the situation in the house/* 

About this situation they had each more to say, 
and about many matters besides, for they faced 
each other over the deep waters of the accumu- 
lated and the undiscussed. They could keep no 
order, and for five minutes more they rather help- 
lessly played with the flood. Dennis was rueful 
at first, for what he seemed to have lighted upon 
was but half his opportunity; then he had an 
inspiration which made him say to his companion 
that they should both, after all, be aUe to make 
terms with any awkwardness by simply meeting 
it with a consciousness that their happiness had 
already taken form. 

**Our happiness?" Rose was all interest. 

** Why, the end of our delays." 

She smiled with every allowance. **Do you 
mean we're to go out and be married this 
minute ? " 

^Well — almost: as soon as Fve read you a 
letter." He produced, with the words, his 
pocket-book. 



THB OTH£B HOU8B 55 

She watched him an instant torn over its con- 
tents. "What letter?" 

** The hest one I eyer got. What have I done 
with it?'* On his feet before her, he continued 
his search. 

**From your people?** 

" From my people. It met me in town, and it 
makes everything possible.'* 

She waited while he fumbled in his pockets; 
with her hands clasped in her lap she sat looking 
up at him. " Then it*s certainly a thing for me to 
hear.** 

** But what the dickens haye I done with it ? ** 
Staring at her, embarrassed, he clapped his hands 
on coat and waistcoat, to other receptacles; at 
the end of a moment in which he had become 
aware of the proximity of the noiseless butler, 
upright in the high detachment of the superior 
servant who has embraced the conception of un- 
packing. 

" Might I ask you for your keys, sir ? *' 

Dennis Vidal had a light — he smote his fore- 
head. " Stupid — it's in my portmanteau I " 

"Then go and get it!" said Rose, who per- 
ceived as she spoke, by the door that faced her, 
that Tony Bream was rejoining them. She got

up, and Tonj, agitated, as she could gee, but 
with complete command of his manneis, immedi- 
atelj and sociably said to Dennis that he was 
ready to guide him upstairs. Rose, at this, inter- 
posed. **Do let Walker take him — I want to 
speak to you.*' 

Tony smiled at the young man. ^Will you 
excuse me then ? " Dennis protested against the 
trouble he was giving, and Walker led him away* 
Rose meanwhile waited not only till they were 
out of sight and of earshot, but till the return of 
Tony, who, his hand on Vidal's shoulder, had 
gone with them as far as the door. 

**Has he brought you good news?** said the 
master of Bounds. 

^ Very good. He*s very well ; he*s all right.** 

Tony's flushed face gave to the laugh with 
which he greeted this almost the effect of that of 
a man who had been drinking. ^Do you mean 
he's quite &ithful?'* 

Rose always met a bold joke. ** As fsithful as 
II But ywT news is the thing.'* 

**Mine?** He closed his eyes a moment, but 
stood there scratching his head as if to carry off 
with a touch of comedy his betrayal of emotion* 

^Has Julia repeated her declaration?**

Tony looked at her in silence. *^ She has done 
something more extraordinary than that," he re* 
plied at last. 

"« What has she done?** 

Tony ghuiced round him, then dropped into a 
chair. He covered his face with his hands. ^^I

RosB ABBnoBB waited, oompassionatelj, for 
Tony to recover himself, dropping again, daring 
the pause, upon the sofa she had just occupied 
with her visitor. At last as, while she watched 
him, his silence continued, she put him a ques* 
tion. ** Does she at any rate still maintain that 
she sha*n't get well?'* 

Tony removed his hands from his face. ** With 
the utmost assurance — or rather with the utmost 
serenity. But she treats that now as a mere 
detail.'* 

Rose wondered. ^You mean she really /Mb 
that she's sinking?*' 

^^So she says." 

*^ But i$ she, good heavens ? Such a thing isn't 
a matter of opinion: it's a fact or it's not a 
fact." 

** It's not a fact," said Tony Bream. ^ How con 
it be when one has only to see that her strength 



 59 

hasn't failed ? She of course says it has, but she 
has a remarkable deal of it to show. What's the 
yehemence with which she expresses herself but a 
sign of increasing life ? It*s excitement, of course 
— partly; but it*s also striking energy." 

**Excitement?" Rose repeated. *^I thought 
you just said she was * serene.'" 

Tony hesitated, but he was perfectly dear. 
** She*s calm about what she calls leaving me, bless 
her heart ; she seems to have accepted that pros- 
pect with the strangest resignation. What she's 
uneasy, what she's in fact still more strangely tor- 
mented and exalted about, is another matter." 

^ I see — the thing you just mentioned." 

^She takes an interest," Tony went on, ^*she 
asks questions, she sends messages, she speaks out 
with all her voice. She's delighted to know that 
Mr. Vidal has at last come to you, and she told 
me to tell you so from her, and to tell him so — 
to tell you both, in fact, how she rejoices that 
what you've so long waited for is now so close at 
hand." 

Rose took this in with lowered eyes. **How 
dear of her I " she murmured. 

^ She asked me particularly about Mr. Vidal," 
Tony continued — ** how he looks, how he strikes 



60 THB OTHER HOU8B 

me* how you met. She gave me indeed a private 
message for him.** 

Rose fiuntly smiled. ^ A priTate one ? ** 

**0h, only to spare your modesty: a woid to 
the effect that she answers for you.** 

«' In what way ? *' Rose asked. 

*^ Why, as the charmingest, cleyeresti handsom* 
est, in every way most wonderful wile that OTer 
any man will have had.** 

^ She u wound up 1 ** Rose laughed. Then she 
said: ^ And all the while what does Nurse think? 
— I don*t mean,** she added with the same sliglit 
irony, ** of whether I shall do for Dennis.** 

^*0f Julia*s condition? She wants Ramage to 
come back." 

Rose thought a moment. ^She*s rather a 
goose, I think — she loses her head.** 

''So I've taken the liberty of telling her.** 
Tony sat forward, his eyes on the floor* hie 
elbows on his knees, and his hands nervously 
rubbing each other. Presently he rose with a 
jerk. ''What do you suppose she wants 
to do?** 

Rose tried to suppose. "Nurse wants you—— ? 

"No — that ridiculous girL'* Nodding \mck at 
his wife's room, he came and stood before the sofa.

Half reclining again. Rose turned it over, 
raising her eyes to him. ^Do you really mean 
something ridiculous?" 

*^ Under the circumstances grotesque." 

^^Well," Rose suggested, smiling, ^^she wants 
you to allow her to name her successor." 

Mjust the contrary I" Tony seated himself 
where Dennis Vidal had sat. ^^She wants me 
to promise her she shall have no successor." 

His companion looked at him hard ; with her 
surprise at something in his tone she had just 
visibly coloured. **I see." She was at a mo- 
mentary loss. ^*Do you call that grotesque?" 

Tony, for an instant, was evidently struck by 
her suiprise; then seeing the reason of it and 
blushing too a little, ^' Not the idea, my dear Rose 
— God forbid I" he exclaimed. ^^What Fm speak- 
ing of is the mistake of giving that amount of 
colour to her insistence — meeting her as if one 
accepted the situation as she represents it and 
were really taking leave of her." 

Rose appeared to understand and even to be 
impressed. ^'Tou think that will make her 
worae?" 

**Why, arranging everything as if she's going 
to die!" Tony sprang up again; his trouble

was obvious, and he fell again into the restless 
pacing that bad been his resource all the morning. 

His interlocutress watched his agitation. 
^ Mayn't it be that, if jou do just that, she'll on 
the contrary immediately find herself better? " 

Tony wondered, scratching his head again. 
^From the spirit of contradiction? Fll do any- 
thing in life that will make her happy, or just 
simply make her quiet: 111 treat her demand as 
intensely reasonable even, if it wn't better to treat 
it as an ado about nothing. But it stuck in my 
crop to lend myself, that way, to a deathbed solem- 
nity. Heaven deliver us I" Half irritated and 
half anxious, suffering from his tenderness a two- 
fold effect, he dropped into another seat with his 
hands in his pockets and his long legs thrust out. 

^ Does she want it very solemn ? " Rose asked. 

*^ She's in dead earnest, poor darling. She wants 
a promise on my sacred honour — a vow of the most 
portentous kind." 

Rose was silent a little. ^ You didn't give it ? " 

^^I turned it off — I refused to take any such 
discussion seriously. I said: *My own darling, 
how can I meet you on so hateful a basis ? Wait 
till you are djring I ' " He lost himself an instant ; 
then he was again on his feet. ^^How in the 



 63 

world can ahe dream Fm capable ?'' He 

hadn't patience even to finish his phrase. 

Rose, however, finished it. ^^ Of taking a sec- 
ond wife ? Ah, that's another affair I " she sadlj 
exclaimed. ** We've nothing to do with that,*' she 
added. ^^Of course you understand Julia's feel- 
ing. 

^ Her feeling ? " Tony once more stood in front 
of her. 

**Why, what's at the bottom of her dread of 
your marrying again ? " 

^ Assuredly I do ! Mrs. Grantham naturally — 
«Ae'« at the bottom. She has fiUed Julia with the 
Tision of my perhaps giving our child a step- 
mother." 

** Precisely," Rose said, ^ and if you had known, 
as I knew it, Julia's girlhood, you would do jus- 
tice to the force of that horror. It possesses her 
whole being — she would prefer that the child 
should die." 

Tony Bream, musing, shook lus head with 
sombre decision. *^Well, I would prefer that 
they neither of them should ! " 

** The simplest thing, then, is to give her your 
word." 

**My *word' isn't enough," Tony said; **she

wants mystic rites and spells I The simplest 
thing, moreover, was exactly what I desired to do. 
My objection to the performance she demands 
was that that was just what it seemed to me not 
to be-" 

^^Tiy it," said Rose, smiling. 

"To bring her round?" 

" Before the Doctor returns. When he comes, 
you know, he won't let you go back to her." 

" Then FU go now," said Tony, already at the 
door. 

Rose had risen from the sofa. ** Be very brief 
— but be very strong." 

" 111 swear by all the gods — that or any other 
nonsense." Rose stood there opposite to him with 
a fine, rich urgency which operated as a detention. 
«« I see you're right," he declared. " You always 
are, and I'm always indebted to you." Then as 
he opened the door: "Is there anything else?" 

"Anything else?" 

"I mean that you advise." 

She thought a moment. " Nothing but that — 
for you to seem to enter thoroughly into her idea, 
to show her you understand it as she understands 
it herself." 

Tony looked vague. "As ihe does?"

Why, for the lifetime of your daughter." 
Ab he appeared still not fully to apprehend, she 
risked: ^If you should lose Effie the reason 
would fail." 

Tony, at this, jerked back his head with a flush. 
^* My dear Rose, you don^t imag^e that it's as a 
needed vow " 

** That you would give it ? " she broke in. " Cer- 
tainly I don't, any more than I suppose the de- 
gree of your fidelity to be the ground on which 
we're talking. But the thing is to convince Julia, 
and I said that only because she'll be more con- 
vinced if you strike her as really looking at what 
you subscribe to." 

Tony gave his nervous laugh. "Don't you 
know I always * put down my name ' — especially 
to * appeals ' — in the most reckless way ? " Then 
abruptly, in a different tone, as if with a passion- 
ate need to make it plain, " I shall never, never, 
never," he protested, " so much as look at another 
woman I " 

The girl approved with an eager gesture. 
"You've got it, my dear Tony. Say it to her 
that way I " But he had already gone, and, turn- 
ing, she found herself face to face with her lover, 
who bad come back as she spoke.

With his letter in his hand Dennis Vidal stood 
and smiled at her. *^What in the world has

^^ To say ? Something to his wife, who appears 
to have fallen into an extraordinary state/* 

The yoang man's face fell. ^ What sort of a 
state?" 

^A strange discouragement about herself. 
She's morbid and frightened — she thinks she's 
sinking." 

Dennis looked grave. ^^Poor little lady — 
what a bore for ui! I remember her per- 
fecUy." 

**She of course remembers you," Rose said. 
** She takes the friendliest interest in your being 
here." 

^^ That's most kind of her in her condition.** 

**0h, her condition," Rose returned, ^ isn't 
quite so bad as she thinks I " 



THB OTHEK HOUBS 67 

^^I see/' Dennis hesitated. ^^And that's 
what Mr. Bream's to tell her." 

^That's a part of it." Rose glanced at the 
document he had brought to her ; it was in its 
envelope, and he tapped it a little impatiently 
on his left finger-tips. What she said, however, 
had no reference to it. ** She's haunted with a 
nervous alarm — on the subject, of all things, 
of his marrying again." 

^* If she should die ? — She wants him not to ? " 
Dennis asked. 

^^She wants him not to." Rose paused a 
moment. ^^ She wants to have been the only one." 

He reflected, slightly embarrassed with this 
peep into a situation that but remotely concerned 
him. ^ Well, I suppose that's the way women 
often feel." 

*^ I daresay it is." The girl's gravity gave the 
gleam/ of a smUe. **I daresay it's the way I 
should." 

Dennis Vidal, at this, simply seized her and 
kissed her. ^'Tou needn't be afraid — you'll be 
the only one I " 

His embrace had been the work of a few sec- 
onds, and she had made no movement to escape 
from it; but she looked at him as if to convey 



68 THE OTHBR HOUSE 

that the extreme high spirits it betrayed were 
perhaps just a trifle mistimed. ^* That's what I 
recommended him," she dropped, ^Ho say to 
JuUa." 

^^ Why, I should hope so ! ^ Presently, as if a 
little struck, Dennis continued : ** Doesn't he want 
to?" 

^* Absolutely. They're all in all to each other. 
But he's naturally much upset and bewildered." 

** And he came to you for advice ? " 

^*0h, he comes to me," Rose said, ^as he 
might come to talk of her with the mother that, 
poor darling, it's her misfortune never to have 
known." 

The young man's vivacity again played up. 
^He treats you, you mean, as his mother-in- 
law?" 

^^Very much. But I'm thoroughly nice to 
him. People can do anything with me who are 
nice to Aer." 

Dennis was silent a moment; he had slipped 
his letter out of its cover. ^ Well, I hope they're 
grateful to you for such devotion." 

*^ Grateful to me, Dennis? They quite adore 
me." Then as if to remind him of something it 
was important he should feel : **• Don't you

what it is for a poor girl to have such an anchor- 
age as this — such honourable countenance, such 
a place to fall back upon ? " 

Thus challenged^ her visitor, with a moment's 
thought, did frank justice to her question. ^^ I'm 
certainly glad jou've such jolly friends — one 
sees they're charming people. It has been a 
grreat comfort to me lately to know you were 
with them." He looked round him, conscien- 
tiously, at the bright and beautiful hall. **It 
ft a good berth, my dear, and it must be a pleas- 
ure to live with such fine things. They've given 
me a room up there that's full of them — an 
awfully nice room." He glanced at a picture 
or two — he took in the scene. ^^Do they roll 
in wealth?" 

^They're like all bankers, I imagine," said 
Rose. ^ Don't bankers always roll ? " 

** Yes, they seem literally to wallow. What a 
pity w€ ain't bankers, eh ? " 

^^Ah, with my friends here their money's the 
least part of them," the girl answered. '^The 
great thing's their personal goodness." 

Dennis had stopped before a large photograph, 
a great picture in a massive frame, supported, on 
a table, by a small gilded easel. ^^ To say noth-

ing of their personal beauty I He's tremendoualy

Rose glanced with an indolgent sigh at a 
representation of Tony Bream in all his splendour, 
in a fine white waistcoat and a high white hat, 
with a stick and gloves and a cigar, his orchid, his 
stature, and his smile. ^* Ah, poor Julia's taste I " 

**Yes," Dennis exclaimed, **one can see how 
he must have fetched her I " 

I mean the style of the thing," said Rose. 
It isn't good, eh ? Well, you know." Then 
turning away from the picture the young man 
added: "They'U be after Asm.'" 

Rose faltered. *^ The people she fears ? " 

*^The dear ladies, bless 'em — if he should lose 
her." 

'' I daresay," said Rose. ^ But hell be proof." 

^^ Has he told you so ? " Dennis smiled. 

She met his smile with a kind of conscious 
bravado in her own. *^ In so many words. But 
he assures me he'll calm her down." 

Dennis was silent a little : he had now unfolded 
his letter and run his eyes over it. **What a 
funny subject for him to be talking about I " 

" With me, do you mean ? " 

** Yes, and with his wife."

^Mj dear man/' Roae exclaimed, **jou can

^ Did yott t " her companion asked. 

She hesitated again, and then, ^^Yes — idiot I" 
she replied with a quiet humour that produced, 
on his part, another demonstration of tenderness. 
This attempt she arrested, raising her hand, as she 
appeared to have heard a sound, with a quick 
injunction to listen. 

" What's the matter ? " 

She bent her ear. ^'Wasn't there a cry from 
Julia's room?" 

** I heard nothing." 

Rose was relieved. ^^Then it's only my ner- 



vousness." 



Dennis Vidal held up his letter. **Is your 
nervousness too great to prevent your giving a 
moment's attention to this? " 

**Ah, your letter?" Rose's eyes rested on it 
as if she had become conscious of it for the first 
time. 

*^It very intimately concerns our future," said 
her visitor. ^^ I went up for it so that you should 
do me the favour to read it." 

She held out her hand promptly and frankly. 
**Then give it to me — let me keep it a little."

Rose held the letter; her large light ejes 
widened with her wonder and her sympathy. 
^* Is it something very good ? *' 

Dennis prescribed, with an emphatic but amused 
nod at the paper, a direction to her ourioeity. 
^ Read and you'll see I " 

She dropped her eyes, but after a moment, 
while her left hand patted her heart, she raised 
them with an odd, strained expression. ^ I mean 
is it really good enough ? " 

*^ That's exactly what I want you to tell m« / '* 
Dennis laughed out. A certain surprise at her 
manner was in his face. 

While she noted it she heard a sound again, a 
sound this time explained by the opening of the 
door of the vestibule. Doctor Ramage had oome 
back ; Rose put down her letter. ^* I'll tell yon

Thb Doctor, eagerly, spoke to her first. ** Our

^*0n the spot." And the Doctor danced off. 

**He's not at all easy," Dennis pronounced 
when he had gone. 

Rose demurred. **How do you know that? 

**By looking at him. I'm not such a fool, 
her visitor added with some emphasis, **as you 
strike me as wishing to make of me." 

Rose candidly stared. ^*As I strike yon as

looked at each other hard, and they both changed 
colour. '* My dear Dennis, what do you mean? " 

He evidently felt that he had been almost vio-

evident to a spectator that he was a man of cool 
courage. *'I mean, Rose, that I don't quite

She appeared immensely relieved. **Why, my

^ I certainly see that you're agitated and absent

Rose's impatience overflowed into a gesture. 
^I've been doing that to deceive my own self I

he went on, considering, ^* it's either one thing or

He was silent a little. ^ Is it anything so very

he feared she might again accuse him of a want 
of feeling; *^I appreciate them perfectly — I do

** Be a little patient with me," she gently said. 
Before he could make a rejoinder, she pursued: 
**You yourself are impressed with the Doctor's 
being anxious. I've been trying not to think 
so, but I daresay you're right. There, I've an- 
other wony." 

^ The greater your worry, then, the more press- 
ing our business." Dennis spoke with cordial 
decision, while Rose, moving away from him, 
reached the door by which the Doctor had gone 
out. She stood there as if listening, and he con- 
tinued: ^^It's me, you know, that you've now to 
« fall back ' upon." 

She had already raised a hand with her dear 
**Hush!" and she kept her eyes on her com- 
panion while she tried to catch a sound. ^*The 
Doctor said he would send him out of the room. 
But he doesn't." 

** All the better — for your reading this." Den* 
uis held out the letter to her. 



THE OTHXB HOU8B 77 

She quitted her place. ^*If he's allowed to 
stay, there must be something wrong." 

**rm very sony for them; but don't you call 
that a statement?" 

** Ah, your letter?" Her attention came back 
to it, and, taking it from him, she dropped again 
upon the sofa with it ^^Voyons^ voyon$ this great 
aflEairl" — she had the air of trying to talk her- 
self into calmness. 

Dennis stood a moment before her. **It puts 
UB on a footing that really seems to me sound." 

She had turned over the leaf to take the measure 
of the document; there were three large, close, 
neat pages. ^^He's a trifle long-winded, the 
• goyemor ' I " 

^ The longer the better," Dennis laughed, " when 
it's all in that key I Head it, my dear, quietly and 
carefully ; take it in — it's really simple enough." 
He spoke soothingly and tenderly, turning off to 
give her time and not oppress her. He moved 
slowly about the hall, whistling very faintly and 
looking again at the pictures, and when he had 
left her she followed him a minute with her eyes. 
Then she transferred them to the door at which 
she had just listened; instead of reading she 
watched as if for a movement of it. If there had 



78 THB OTfi^BB HOUBS 

been anyone at that moment to see her face, such 
an observer would liave found it strangely, tragi- 
cally convulsed : she had the appearance of holding 
in with extraordinary force some passionate sob or 
cry, some smothered impulse of anguish. This 
appearance vanished miraculously as Dennis turned 
at the end of the room, and what he saw, while 
the g^at showy clock ticked in the scented still- 
ness, was only his friend's study of what he had put 
before her. She studied it long, she studied it in 
silence — a silence so unbroken by inquiry or com- 
ment that, though he clearly wished not to seem 
to hurry her, he drew nearer again at last and 
stood as if waiting for some sign. 

*^ Don't you call that really meeting a fellow ? ** 
*'I must read it again,*' Rose replied without 
looking up. She turned afresh to the beginning, 
and he strolled away once more. She went 
through to the end; after which she said with 
tranquillity, folding the letter: ^Yes; it shows 
what they think of you." She put it down where 
she had put it before, getting up as he came back 
to her. ** It's good not only for what he says, bat 
for the way he sa}rs it" 

** It's a jolly bit more than I expected." Dennis 
picked the letter up and, restoring it to its en- 



THB OTHEB HOUSE 79 

yelope, slipped it almost lovingly into a breast- 
pocket. ^It does show, I think, that they don't 
want to lose me." 

** They're not such fools!" Rose had in her 
torn moved off, but now she faced him, so intensely 
pale that he was visibly startled ; all the more that 
it marked still more her white grimace. ** My dear 
boy, it's a splendid future." 

^I'm glad it strikes you sol" he laughed. 

^ It's a great joy — you're all right. As I said 
a while ago, you're a made man." 

^Then by the same token, of course, you're 
a made woman!" 

** I'm very, very happy about you," she brightly 
conceded. ^* The great thing is that there's more 
to come." 

^ Rather — there's more to come I " said Dennis. 
He stood meeting her singular smile. ** I'm only 
waiting for it." 

**I mean there's a lot behind — a general 
attitude. Read between the lines!" 

** Don't you suppose I havey Miss? I didn't 
venture, myself, to say that to you." 

*^ Do I have so to be prompted and coached ? " 
asked Rose. *^I don't believe you even see all 
I mean. There are hints and tacit promises-^ 



80  

glimpses of what may happen if youll gi^a 
them time." 

*^0h, m give them time I" Dennia declared. 
^ But he's really awfully cautioua. Toa're sharp 
to have made out so much." 

** Naturally — I'm sharp." Then, after an iu- 
stanty **Let me have the letter again," the girl 
said, holding out her hand. Dennis promptly 
drew it forth, and she took it and went over 
it in silence once more. He turned away as he 
had done before, to give her a chance; he 
hummed slowly, to himself, about the room, and 
once more, at the end of some minutes, it 
appeared to strike him that she prolonged her 
perusal. But when he approached her again 
she was ready with her clear contentment She 
folded the letter and handed it back to him. 
**0h, you'll do I" she proclaimed. 

** You're really quite satisfied?" 

She hesitated a moment. ^For the present — 
perfectly." Her eyes were on the precious 
document as he fingered it, and something in 
his way of doing so made her break into incon- 
gruous gaiety. He had opened it delicately and 
been caught again by a passage. **You handle 
it as if it were a thousand-pound note I"

He looked up at her quickly. ^^It's much 
more than that. Capitalise his figure." 

*•* Capitalise ' it?" 

^Find the invested sum." 

Rose thought a moment. **0h, I'll do every- 
thing for you but cipher I But it's millions." 
Then as he returned the letter to his pocket she 
added : ** You should have that thing mounted in 
double glass — with a little handle like a hand- 



screen."

There's certainly nothing too good for the 
charter of our liberties — for that's what it really 
is," Dennis said. *^ But you can face the music ? " 
he went on. 

** The music ? " — Rose was momentarily blank. 

He looked at her hard again. ^^ You have, my 
dear, the most extraordinary vacuities. The figure 
we're talking of — the poor, dear little figure. 
The five-hundred-and-forty," he a trifle sharply 
explained. ** That's about what it makes." 

*^Why, it seems to me a lovely little figure," 
said the girl. **To the * likes' of me, how can 
that be anjrthing but a duck of an income ? Then," 
she exclaimed, ** think also of what's to come I " 

**Ye8 — but I'm not speaking of anything you 
may faring." 



82 THB OTHXB HOU8X 

Rose wavered, judicious, as if txying to be as 
attentiTe as he desired. **I see — without that 
But I wasn't speaking of that either,** she added. 

** Oh, you may count it — I only mean I don*t 
touch it. And the going out — you take that 
too ? *' Dennis asked. 

Rose looked brave. *^Why it's only for two 
years.'* 

He flushed suddenly, as with a flood of reassur- 
ance, putting his arms round her as round the 
fulfilment of his dream. ^ Ah, my own old girl I ** 

She let him clasp her again, but when she disen- 
gaged herself they were somehow nearer to the 
door that led away to Julia Bream. She stood 
there as she had stood before, while he still held 
one of her hands; then she brought forth some- 
thing that betrayed an extraordinary disconnection 
from all that had just preceded. *^I can't make 
it out why he doesn't send him back I" 

Dennis Vidal dropped her hand ; both his own 
went into his pockets, and he gave a kick to the 
turned-up comer of a rug. ** Mr. Bream — the 
Doctor? Oh, they know what they're about I" 

** The Doctor doesn't at all want him to be there. 
Something has happened," Rose declared as she 
left the door. 



 88 

Her companion said nothing for a moment. 
** Do you mean the poor lady's gone ? " he at last 
demanded. 

** Gone ? " Rose echoed. 

**Do you mean Mrs. Bream is dead?" 

His question rang out so that Rose threw her- 
self back in horror. ** Dennis — God forbid!" 

^ God forbid too, I say. But one doesn't know 
what you mean — you're too diflScult to follow. 
One thing, at any rate, you clearly have in your 
head — that we must take it as possibly on the 
cards. That's enough to make it remarkably to 
the point to remind you of the g^at change that 
would take place in your situation if she 9hatdd 
die." 

^ What ebe in the world but that change am I 
thinking of ? " Rose asked. 

*^ You're not thinking of it perhaps so much in 
the connection I refer to. If Mrs. Bream goes, 
your * anchorage,' as you call it, goes." 

** I see what you mean." She spoke with the 
softest assent ; the tears had sprung into her eyes 
and she looked away to hide them. 

M One may have the highest possible opinion of 
her husband and yet not quite see you staying 
on here in the same manner with Am." 



84 THB OTHEE HOtTU 



Rose was silent, with a certain dignity. **Not 
quite,** she presently said with the same gen- 
tleness. 

*' The way therefore to provide against every- 
thing is — as I remarked to you a while ago — to 
settle with me this minute the day, the nearest 
one possible, for our union to become a reality/* 

She slowly brought back her troubled eyes. 
**The day to marry you?" 

** The day to marry me, of course I ** He gave 
a short, uneasy laugh. ^ What else ? *' 

She waited again, and there was a kind of fear 
in her face. ^I must settle it this minute?'* 

Dennis stared. ** Why, my dear ohild^ ^rtien in 
the world if not now ? ** 

^Tou can't give me a little more time?** she 
asked. 

^ More time ? ** His gathered stupefaction broke 
out. ** More time — after giving you years ? ** 

^ Ah, but just at the last here — this news, this 
rush is sudden." 

^Sudden I" Dennis repeated. **Haven*t yon 
known I was coming, and haven*t you known for 
what?** 

She looked at him now with an effort of resolu* 
tion in which he could see her white face harden ; 



THB OTHER HOUBB 85 

as if by a play of some inner mechanism some- 
tiling dreadful bad taken place in it. Then she 
said with a painful quaver that no attempt to 
be natural could keep down: **Let me remind 
you, Dennis, that your coming was not at my 
request. You've come — yes; but you've come 
because you would. You've come — you've come 
in spite of me.'* 

He gasped, and with the mere touch of her tone 
his own eyes filled. ^ You haven't wanted me ? " 

**rm delighted to see you." 

**Then in Gh>d's name what do you mean? 
Where are we, and what are you springing on 
me?" 

** Fm only asking you again, as I've asked you 
already, to be patient with me — to let me, at 
such a critical hour, turn round. I'm only ask- 
ing you to bear with me — I'm only asking you 
to wait.'* 

^ To wait for what ? " — he snatched the word out 
of her mouth. ** It's because I have waited that I'm 
here. What I want of you is three simple words — 
that you can utter in three simple seconds." He 
looked about him in his helpless dismay, as if to 
call the absent to witness. ** And you look at me 
a stone. You open up an abyss. You give 



86 THE OTHER HOUBB 

me nothing, nothing." He paused, as it were, for 
a contradiction, but she made none ; she had low- 
ered her eyes and, supported against a table, stood 
there rigrid and passiye. Dennis sank into a chair 
with his vain hands upon his knees. ^ What do 
you mean by my coming in spite of you? Ton 
never asked me not to — you've treated me well 
till now. It was my idea — yes ; but you perfectly 
accepted it." He gave her time to assent to this 
or to deny it, but she took none, and he continued: 
** Don't you understand the one feeling that has 
possessed me and sustained me ? Don't you under- 
stand that I've thought of nothing else every hour 
of my way ? I arrived here with a longing for you 
that words can't utter; and now I see — though I 
couldn't immediately be sure — that I found you 
from the first constrained and unnatural." 

Rose, as he went on, had raised her eyes again ; 
they seemed to follow his words in sombre sub- 
mission. ^ Yes, you must have found me strange 
enough." 

^And don't again say it's your being anx- 
ious I " Dennis sprang up wamingly. ^ It's 

your being anxious that just makes my right." 

His companion shook her head slowly and am- 
biguously, ^ I am glad you've come." 



THB OTHBB HOUBB 87 

** To haye the pleasure of not receiving me ? " 

" I have received you," Rose replied. ** Every 
word I've spoken to you and every satisfaction I've 
expressed is true, is deep. I do admire you, I do 
respect you, I'm proud to have been your friend. 
Haven't I assured you of my pure joy in your pro- 
motion and your prospects ? " 

^ What do you call assuring me ? Tou utterly 
misled me for some strange moments ; you mysti- 
fied me ; I think I may say you trifled with me. 
The only assurance I'm open to is that of your 
putting your hand in mine as my wife. In God's 
name,*' the young man panted, *^what has hap- 
pened to you and what has changed you?" 

**ril tell you to-morrow," said Rose. 

"^Tell me what I wantf' 

She cast about her. **Tell you things I can't 
now." 

He sounded her with visible despair. ^* You're 
not sincere — you're not straight. You've noth- 
ing to tell me, and you're afraid. You're only 
gaining time, and you've only been doing so 
from the first. I don't know what it's for — 
you're beyond me; but if it's to back out, I'll 
be hanged if I give you a moment." 

Her wan face, at this, showed a faint flush; 



88 THB OTHXR HOUBB 

it seemed to him fire yean older than when he 
came in. *^Toa take, with your cruel accusa- 
tions, a strange way to keep me I'' the giil 
exclaimed. **But I won*t talk to you in bitteiv 
nessi" she pursued in a different tone. **That 
will drop if we do allow it a day or two.'* Then 
on a sharp motion of his impatience she added: 
** Whether you allow it or not, you know, I 
must take the time I need.** 

He was angry now, as if she were not only 
proved evasion, but almost proved insolence; 
and his anger deepened at her return to this 
appeal that offered him no meaning. ^No, no, 
you must choose,** he said with passion, **and 
if you*re really honest you will. I*m here for 
you with all my soul, but Fm here for you now 
or never.** 

*^ Dennis I** she weakly murmured. 

**Tou do back out?** 

She put out her hand. ** Oood-bye.** 

He looked at her as over a flood; then he 
thrust his hand behind him and glanced about 
for his hat He moved blindly, like a man 
picking himself up from a violent fall — flung 
indeed suddenly from a smooth, swift vehicle. 
** Goodrbye." 



Dknnis Yidal quickly remembered that he 
had not brought in his hat» and also, the next 
instant, that even to clap it on wouldn't under 
the circumstances qualify him for immediate de- 
parture from Bounds. Just as it came over him 
that the obligation he had incurred must keep 
him at least for the day, he found himself in 
the presence of his host, who, while his back 
was turned, had precipitately reappeared and 
whose vision of the place had resulted in an in- 
stant question. 

**Mr8. Beever has not come back? Julia 
wants her — Julia must see her I " 

Dennis was separated by the width of the hall 
from the girl with whom he had just enjoyed 
such an opportunity of reunion, but there was 
for the moment no indication that Tony Bream, 
engrossed with a graver accident, found a be- 
trayal in the space between them. He had, 



90  

however, for Dennis the prompt effect of a re- 
minder to take care: it was a conseqaence of 
the very nature of the man that to look at him 
was to recognise the value of appearances and 
that he couldn't have dropped out upon a scene, 
however disoi-dered, without, by the simple fact, 
re-establishing a superficial harmony. His new 
friend met him with a movement that might 
have been that of stepping in front of some ob- 
ject to hide it, while Rose, on her side, sound- 
ing out like a touched bell, was already alert 
with her response. **Ah,'' said Dennis to him- 
self, *^it's for them she cares I'* 

*^She has not come back, but if there's a 
hurry " Rose was all there. 

^ There u a hurry. Someone must go for her.** 

Dennis had a point to make that he must 
make on the spot. He spoke before Rose*s 
rejoinder. *'With your increasing anxieties, Mr. 
Bream, I'm quite ashamed to be quartered on 
you. Hadn't I really better be at the inn?'* 

**At the inn — to go from here? My dear 
fellow, are you mad?'* Tony sociably scoffed; 
he wouldn't hear of it ** Don't be afraid ; we*ve 
plenty of use for you — if only to keep this 
young woman quiet.'* 



THB OTHER HOUSE 91 

^ He can be of use this instant." Rose looked 
at her suitor as if there were not the shadow 
of a cloud between them. **The servants are 
getting luncheon. Will you go over for Mrs. 
Beever?" 

"Ah," Tony demurred, laughing, **we mustn't 
make him fetch and carry!" 

Dennis showed a momentary blankness and 
then, in his private discomposure, jumped at the 
idea of escaping from the house and into the 
air. "Do employ me," he pleaded; "I want to 
stretch my legs. I'll do anything." 

" Since you're so kind, then, and it's so near," 
Tony replied. "Mrs. Beever's our best friend, 
and always the friend of our friends, and she's 
only across the river." 

**Just six minutes," said Rose, "by the short 
way. Bring her back with you." 

"The short way,'* Tony pressingly explained, 
"is through my garden and out of it by the 
gate on the river." 

"At the river you turn to the right — the 
little foot-bridge is her bridge," Rose went 
on. 

"You pass the gatehouse at the other side of 
it, and there you are," said Tony. 



92  

** 111 her garden — it's lovely. Tell her it's for 
Mrs. Bream, and it's important," Rose added. 

^^My wife's calling aloud for her I" Tony 
laid his hand, with his floshed laogh, on the 
young man's shoulder. 

Dennis had listened earnestly, looking at his 
companions in turn. ^It doesn't matter if she 
doesn't know in the least who I am?" 

**She knows perfectly — don't be shy I" Rosa 
familiarly exclaimed. 

Tony gave him a great pat on the hack which 
sent him off. **She has even something partic- 
ular to say to you I She takes a great interest 
in his relations with you," he continued to Rose 
as the door closed behind their visitor. Then 
meeting in her face a certain impatience of any 
supersession of the question of Julia's state, he 
added, to justify his aUusion, a word accompanied 
by the same excited laugh that had already 
broken from him. ** Mrs. Beever deprecates the 
idea of any further delay in your marriage, and 
thinks you've got quite enough to * set up' on. 
She pronounces your means remarkably add- 
quate." 

**What does she know about our means?" 
Rose coldly asked. 



THE OTHER HOITSE 98 

^ No more, doubtlesa, than 1 1 But that needn't 
prevent her. It's the wish that's father to the 
thought. That's the result of her general good 
will to you." 

*^She has no good will of any sort to me. 
She doesn't like me." Rose spoke with marked 
dryness, in which moreover a certain surprise at 
the direction of her friend's humour was visible. 
Tony was now completely out of his groove; 
they indeed both were, though Rose was for the 
moment more successful in concealing her emo- 
tion. Still vibrating with the immense effort of 
the morning and particularly of the last hour, 
she could yet hold herself hard and observe 
what was taking place in her companion. He 
had been through something that had made his 
nerves violently active, so that his measure of 
security, of reality almost, was merged in the 
mere sense of the unusual. It was precisely this 
evidence of what he had been through that helped 
the girl's curiosity to preserve a waiting attitude 
— the firm surface she had triumphantly pre- 
sented to each of the persons whom, from an 
early hour, she had had to encounter. But Tony 
had now the air of not intending to reward her 
patience by a fresh communication; it was as if 



94  

some new delicacy had operated and he had struck 
himself as too explicit. He had looked astonished 
at her judgment of the lady of Eastmead. 

"My dear Rose," he said, "I think you're 
greatly mistaken — Mrs. Beever much appreci- 
ates you." 

She was silent at first, showing him a face 
worn with the ingenuity of all that in her inter- 
view with Dennis Vidal she had had to keep out 
of it and put into it. "My dear Tony," she 
then blandly replied, "I've never known any 
one like you for not having two grains of obser- 
vation. I've known people with only a little; 
but a little's a poor affair. You've absolutely 
none at all, and that, for your character, is the 
right thing: it's magnificent and perfect." 

Tony greeted this with real hilarity. "I like 
a good square one between the eyes I" 

"You can't like it as much as I like you for 
being just as you are. Observation's a second- 
rate thing; it's only a precaution — the refuge 
of the small and the timid. It protects our own 
ridicules and props up our defences. You may 
have ridicules — I don't say so; but you've no 
suspicions and no fears and no doubts; you're 
natural and generous and easy " 



 95 

**And beautifully, exquisitely stupid 1" Tony 
broke in. " * Natural ' — thank you 1 Oh, the hor- 
rible people who are natural! What you mean 
— only you're too charming to say it — is that 
I'm so utterly taken up with my own interests 
and feelings that I pipe about them like a canary 
in a cage. Not to have the things you mention, 
and above all not to have imagination, is simply 
not to have tact, than which nothing is more 
unforgivable and more loathsome. What lovelier 
proof of my selfishness could I be face to face 
with than the fact — which I immediately after- 
wards blushed for — that, coming into you here 
a while ago, in the midst of something so impor- 
tant to you, I hadn't the manners to ask you so 
much as a question about it?" 

^Do you mean about Mr. Vidal — after he had 
gone to his room ? Tou did ask me a question," 
Rose said; **but you had a subject much more 
interesting to speak of." She waited an instant 
before adding: *^You spoke of something I 
haven't ceased to think of." This gave Tony a 
chance for reference to his discharge of the 
injunction she had then laid upon him; as 
a reminder of which Rose further observed: 
«' There's plenty of time for Mr. Vidal." 



96 THB OTHEB HOUSE 

^* I hope indeed he's going to stay. I like his 
looks immensely," Tony responded. *^I like his 
type; it matches so with what you've told me 
of him. It's the real thing — I wish we had him 
here." Rose, at this, gave a small, confused cry, 
and her host went on: '*Upon my honour I do 
— I know a man when I see him. He's just the 
sort of fellow I personally should have liked 
to be." 

**Tou mean yimWe not the real thing?" Rose 
asked. 

It was a question of a kind that Tony's good 
nature, shining out almost splendidly even through 
trouble, could always meet with princely extrava- 
gance. ^^Not a bit! I'm bolstered up with aU 
sorts of little appearances and accidents. Tour 
friend there has his feet on the rock." This 
picture of her friend's position moved Rose to 
another vague sound — the effect of which, in 
turn, was to make Tony look at her more 
sharply. But he appeared not to impute to her 
any doubt of his assertion, and after an instant 
he reverted, with a jump, to a matter that he 
evidently wished not to drop. ^^ Tou must really, 
you know, do justice to Mrs. Beever. When she 
dislikes one it's not a question of shades or de- 



 97 

grees. She's not an underhand enemy — she very 
soon lets one know it." 

^*Tou mean by something she says or does?" 

Tony considered a moment. ^' I mean she gives 
you her reasons — she's eminently direct. And 
I'm sure she has never lifted a finger against you." 

*^ Perhaps not. But she will/' said Rose. 
"You yourself just gave me the proof." 

Tony wondered. "What proof?" 

"Why, in telling Dennis that she had told 
you she has something special to say to him." 

Tony recalled it — it had already passed out 
of his mind. " What she has to say is only what 
I myself have already said for the rest of us — 
that she hopes with all her heart things are now 
smooth for his marriage." 

"Well, what could be more horrid than that?" 

"More horrid?" Tony stared. 

" What has she to do with his marriage ? Her 
interference is in execrable taste." 

The girl's tone was startling, and her com- 
panion's surprise augmented, showing itself in 
his lighted eyes and deepened colour. " My dear 
Rose, isn't that sort of thing, in a little circle 
like ours, a permitted joke — a friendly compli- 
ment? We're all so with you." 



98 THS OTHSB UOUBB 

She bad turned away from him. She went 
on, as if she had not heard him, with a sadden 
tremor in her voice — the tremor of a deep up- 
heaval: ^ Why does she give opinions that nobody 
wants or asks her for? What does she know of 
our relations or of what diflBculties and mysteries 
she touches? Why can't she leave us alone — 
at least, for the first hour?" 

Embarrassment was in Tony*s gasp — the un- 
expected had sprung up before him. He could 
only stammer after her as she moved away: 
^ Bless my soul, my dear child — you don't 
mean to say there are difficulties? Of course 
it's no one's business — but one hoped you were 
in quiet waters." Across her interval, as he 
spoke, she suddenly faced round, and his view of 
her, with this, made him smite bis forehead in his 
penitent, expressive way. **What a brute I am 
not to have seen you're not quite happy, and 
not to have noticed that A«" — Tony caught 
himself up: the face offered him was the con- 
vulsed face that had not been offered Dennis 
Vidal. Rose literally glared at him; she stood 
there with her two hands on her heaving breast 
and something in all her aspect that was like 
the first shock of a great accident. What he 



THB OTHER H0U8B 99 

saw, without understanding it, was the final 
snap of her tremendous tension, the end of her 
wonderful false calm. He misunderstood it in 
fact, as he saw it give way before him: he 
sprang at the idea that the poor girl had re- 
ceived a blow — a blow which her self-control 
up to within a moment only presented as more 
touchingly borne. Vidal's absence was there as 
a part of it: the situation flashed into vividness. 
^His eagerness to leave you surprised me," he 
exclaimed, ^* and yours to make him go I " Tony 
thought again, and before he spoke his thought 
her eyes seemed to glitter it back. '*He has 
not brought you bad news — he has not failed 
of what we hoped?** He went to her with 
compassion and tenderness. **Tou don't mean 
to say, my poor girl, that he doesn't meet you 
as you supposed he would?" Rose dropped, 
as he came, into a chair; she had burst into 
passionate tears. She threw herself upon a small 
table, burying her head in her arms, while Tony, 
all wonder and pity, stood above her and felt 
helpless as she sobbed. She seemed to have 
sunk under her wrong and to quiver with her 
pain. Her host, with his own recuiTent pang, 
could scarcely bear it: he felt a sharp need of

making someone pay. *^You don't mean to say 
Mr. Vidal doesn't keep faith ? '' 

•'Oh, GodI oh, GodI oh, GodI" Rose Armiger 
wailed.

Tony turned away from her with a moyement 
which was a confession of incompetence; a sense, 
moreover, of the awkwardness of being so close 
to a grief for which he had no direct remedy. 
He could only assure her, in his confusion, of 
his deep regret that she had had a distress. 
The extremity of her collapse, however, was 
brief, a gust of passion after which she instantly 
showed the effort to recover. *' Don't mind me," 
she said through her tears, **I shall pull myself 
together — I shall be all right in a moment." 
He wondered whether he oughtn't to leave her; 
and yet to leave her was scarcely courteous. 
She was quickly erect again, with her charac- 
teristic thought for others flowering out through 
her pain. "Only don't let Julia know — that's 
all I ask of you. One's little bothen are one's 
little bothers — they're all in the day's work. 
Just give me three minutes, and I sha'n't show

a trace." She straightened herself and even 
smiled, patting her eyes with her crumpled 
handkerchief, while Tony marvelled at her cour> 
age and good-humour. 

^^Of one thing you must be sure. Rose," he 
expressively answered; ^^that whatever happens 
to you, now or at any time, you've friends here 
and a home here that are yours for weal and 
woe!" 

**Ah, don't say that," she cried; **I can 
scarcely bear it ! Disappointments one can meet ; 
but how in the world is one adequately to meet 
generosity? Of one thing you, on your side, 
must be sure, that no trouble in life shall ever 
make me a bore. It was because I was so awfully 
afraid to be one that I've been keeping myself 
in — and that has led, in this ridiculous way, to 
my making a fool of myself at the last. I knew 
a hitch was coming — I knew at least something 
was ; but I hoped it would come and go without 
tAu.'" She had stopped before a mirror, still 
dealing, like an actress in the wing, with her ap- 
pearance, her make-up. She dabbed at her cheeks 
and pressed her companion to leave her to herself. 
^^ Don't mind me, don't mind me ; and, above all, 
don't ask any questions." 



THB OTHBR HOUSB 103 

^^Ab," said Tony in friendly remonstrance, 
*^your bravery makes it too bard to belp you!'' 

" Don't try to belp me — don't even want to. 
And don't tell any tales. Husb!" sbe went on 
in a different tone. ^^ Here's Mrs. Beever I " 

The lady of Eastmead was preceded by tbe

nounced luncbeon as invidiously as if it bad 
only been waiting for ber. Tbe servants at eacb

** Luncheon's all very well," said Tony, "but 
wbo in tbe world's to eat it? Before you do," 
be continued, to Mrs. Beever, " there's something 
I must ask of you." 

"And something I must ask too," Rose added, 
while tbe butler retired like a conscientious 
minister retiring from untenable office. She ad- 
dressed herself to their neighbour with a face 
void, to Tony's astonishment, of every vestige 
of disorder. " Didn't Mr. Vidal come back with 
you ? " 

Mrs. Beever looked incorruptible. "Indeed 
he did!" she sturdily replied. "Mr. Vidal is 
in tbe garden of this bouse." 

"Then 111 call him to luncheon." And Rose

floated away, leaving her companions confronted 
in a silence that ended — as Tony was lost in 
the wonder of her presence of mind — only when 
Mrs. Beever had assured herself that she was 
out of earshot. 

**She has broken it off I*' this lady then re- 
sponsibly proclaimed. 

Her colleague demurred. ^' She ? How do you 
know?" 
**I know because he has told me so." 
** Already — in these few minutes?" 
Mrs. Beever hung fire. **0f course I asked 
him first. I met him at the bridge — I saw he 
had had a shock." 

''It^s Rose who has had the shock I" Tony 
returned. ^It*s he who has thrown her over." 
Mrs. Beever stared. ''That's her story?" 
Tony reflected. *' Practically — yes." 
Again his visitor hesitated, but only for an 
instant. '' Then one of them lies." 

Tony laughed out at her lucidity. ''It isn't 
Rose Armiger ! " 

" It isn't Dennis Vidal, my dear. I believe in 
him," said Mrs. Beever. 

Her companion's amusement grew. "Your 
operations are rapid." 



THB OTHER HOUSB 105 

** Remarkably. I've asked him to come to me." 

Tony raised his eyebrows. ^*To come to 
you ? " 

^^Till he can get a train — to-morrow. He 
can't stay on here.'* 

Tony looked at it. **I see what yoa mean." 

^* That's a blessing — you don't always ! I like 
him — he's my sort. And something seems to 
tell me I'm his 1 " 

^* I won't gracefully insult you by saying you're 
everyone's," Tony observed. Then, after an in- 
stant, ** Is he very much cut up? " he inquired. 

^He's utterly staggered. He doesn't under- 
stand." 

Tony thought again. **No more do I. But 
you'll console him," he added. 

"^ I'll feed him first," said his neighbour. '' I'll 
take him back with me to luncheon." 

^'Is that scarcely civil?" 

^* Civil to you ? " Mrs. Beever interposed. 
'* That's exactly what he asked me. I told him 
I would arrange it with you." 

^*And you're * arranging' it, I see. But how 
can you take him if Rose is bringing him in?" 

Mrs. Beever was silent a while. **She isn't. 
She hasn't gone to him. That was for me." 



106 THB OTHBB H0U8B 

Tony looked at her in wonder. *^Your opera- 
tions are rapid," he repeated. *^But I found 
her under the unmistakable effect of a blow.'* 

*^I found her exactly as usual." 

**Well, that also was for you," said Tony. 
** Her disappointment's a secret." 

^Then Vm much obliged to you for mention- 
ing it" 

**I did so to defend her against your bad 
account of her. But the whole thing's obscure," 
the young man added with sudden weariness. 
** I give it up I " 

*^J don't — I shall straighten it out." Mrs. 
Beever spoke with high decision. ^^But I must 
see your wife first." 

** Rather I — she's waiting all this while." He 
had already opened the door. 

As she reached it she stopped again. ^ Shall 
I find the Doctor with her?" 

"Yes, by her request." 

"" Then how i$ she ? " 

" Maddening ! " Tony exclaimed ; after which, 
as his visitor echoed the word, he went on: "I 
mean in her dreadful obsession, to which poor 
Ramage has had to give way, and which is the 
direct reason of her calling you." 



THB OTHER HOUSE 107 

Mrs. Beever's little eyes seemed to see more 
than he told her, to have indeed the vision of 
something formidable. **What dreadful obses- 
sion?" 

** She'll tell you herself." He turned away 
to leave her to go, and she disappeared; but 
the next moment he heard her again on the 
threshold. 

**Only a word to say that that child may 
turn up." 

"What child?" He had already forgotten. 

" Oh, if you don't remember ! " Mrs. Bee- 

ver, with feminine inconsequence, almost took it 
ill. 

Tony recovered the agreeable image. 

"Oh, your niece? Certainly — I remember 
her hair." 

"She's not my niece, and her hair's hideous. 
But if she does come, send her straight home ! " 

" Very good," said Tony. This time his visitor 
vanished.

Hb moved a minate about the hall; then he 
dropped upon a sofa with a sense of exhaustion 
and a sudden need of rest: he stretched himself, 
closing his eyes, glad to be alone, glad above 
all to make sure that he could lie still. He 
wished to show himself he was not nervous; 
he took up a position with the purpose not 
to budge till Mrs. Beever should come back. 
His house was in an odd condition, with lunch- 
eon pompously served and no one able to go to 
it. Poor Julia was in a predicament, poor Rose 
in another, and poor Mr. Vidal, fasting in the 
garden, in a greater one than either. Tony 
sighed as he thought of this dispersal, but he 
stiffened himself resolutely on his couch. He 
wouldn't go in alone, and he couldn't even enjoy 
Mrs. Beever. It next occurred to him that he 
could still less enjoy her little friend, the child 

he had promised to turn away ; on which he gave 

loe 



THB OTHER HOUSE 109 

a sigh that represented partly privation and 
partly resignation — partly also a depressed per- 
ception of the fact that he had never in all his 
own healthy life been less eager for a meal. 
Meanwhile, however, the attempt to stop pac- 
ing the floor was a success; he felt as if in 
closing his eyes he destroyed the vision that 
had scared him. He was cooler, he was easier, 
and he liked the smell of flowers in the dusk. 
What was droll, when he gave himself up to it, 
was the sharp sense of lassitude ; it had dropped 
on him out of the blue, and it showed him how 
a sudden alarm — such as, after all, he had had 
— could drain a fellow in an hour of half his 
vitality. He wondered whether, if he might be 
undisturbed a little, the result of this surrender 
wouldn't be to make him delightfully lose con- 
sciousness. 

He never knew, afterwards, whether it was in 
the midst of his hope, or on the inner edge of a 
doze just achieved, that he became aware of a foot- 
fall betraying an uncertain advance. He raised 
his lids to it and saw before him the pretty girl 
from the other house, whom, for a moment before 
he moved, he lay there looking at. He immedi- 
ately recognised that what had roused him was 



110 THB OTHER H0U8B 

the fact thati noUelessly and for a few seconds, her 
eyes had rested on his face. She uttered a blush* 
ing ** Oh I '' which deplored this effect of her pro- 
pinquity and which brought Tony straight to his 
feet. **Ah, good morning I How d*ye do?'* 
Eyexything came back to him but her name. 
** Excuse my attitude — I didn't hear you come 
m. 

^ When I saw you asleep Fm afraid I kept the 
footman from speaking.*' Jean Martle was much 
embarrassed, but it contributed, in the happiest 
way, to her animation. ^*I came in because he 
told me that Cousin Kate's here." 

**0h yes, she's here — she thought you might 
arrive. Do sit down," Tony added, with his 
prompt instinct of what, in his own house, was 
due from a man of some confidence to a girl of 
none at all. It operated before he could check it, 
and Jean was as passive to it as if he had tossed 
her a command ; but as soon as she was seated, to 
obey him, in a high-backed, wide-armed Venetian 
chair which made a gilded cage for her flutter, 
and he had again placed himself — not in the 
same position— on the sofa opposite, he recalled 
the request just preferred by Mrs* Beerer. He 
was to send her straight home ; yes, it was to be 



THB OTHER HOUSE 111 

invited instantlj to retrace her steps that she sat 
there panting and pink. 

Meanwhile she was very upright and very seri- 
ous; she seemed very anxious to explain. ^*I 
thought it better to come, since she wasn't there. 
I had gone off to walk home with the Marshes — 
I was gone rather long; and when I came back 
she had left the house — the servants told me she 
must be here.*' 

Tony could only meet with the note of hospital- 
ity so logical a plea. *^ Oh, it's all right — Mrs. 
Beever's with Mrs. Bream." It was apparently 
all wrong — he must tell her she couldn't stay; 
but there was a prior complication in his memoiy 
of having invited her to luncheon. ^I wrote to 
your cousin — I hoped you'd come. Unfortunately 
she's not staying herself." 

** Ah, then, I mustn't I " Jean spoke with lucid- 
ity, but without quitting her chair. 

Tony hesitated. '' She'll be a little while yet— 
my wife has something to say to her." 

The girl had fixed her eyes on the floor; she 
might have been reading there the fact that for 
the first time in her life she was regularly calling 
on a gentleman. Since this was the singular case 
she must at least call properly. Her manner 



112 THB OTHBB H0U8B 

revealed an earnest effort to that end, an effort 
visible even in the fear of a liberty if she shonld 
refer too familiarly to Mrs. Bream. She cast 
about her, with intensity, for something that 
would show sympathy without freedom, and, as 
a result, presently produced: **I came an hour 
ago, and I saw Miss Armiger. She told me she 
would bring down the baby." 

"But she didn't ?•• 

"No, Cousin Kate thought it wouldn't do." 

Tony was happily struck* "It will do — it 
ihall do. Should you like to see her?" 

"I thought I should like it very much. It's 
very kind of you." 

Tony jumped up. "Fll show her to you my- 
self." He went over to ring a bell ; then, as he 
came back, he added : " I delight in showing her. 
I think she's the wonder of the world." 

" That's what babies always seem to me," said 
Jean. " It's so absorbing to watch them." 

These remarks were exchanged with great 
gravity, with stiffish pauses, while Tony hung 
about till his ring should be answered. 

"Absorbing?" he repeated. "Isn't it, prepos- 
terously? Wait till you've watched Effie ! " 

His visitor preserved for a while a silence which 



THB OTHER HOUSE 113 

might have indicated that, with this injunction, 
her waiting had begun ; but at last she said with 
the same simplicity : ** I've a sort of original rea- 
son for my interest in her." 

^Do you mean the illness of her poor mother?" 
He saw that she meant nothing so patronising, 
though her countenance fell with the reminder of 
this misfortune : she heard with awe that the un- 
conscious child was menaced. ** That's a very 
good reason," he declared, to relieve her. *^ But 
so much the better if youVe got another too. I 
hope you^U never want for one to be kind to her." 

She looked more assured. **I'm just the per- 
son always to be." 

M Just the person?" — Tony felt that he must 
draw her out. She was now arrested, however, by 
the arrival of a footman, to whom he immediately 
turned. ** Please ask Gorham to be as good as to 
bring down the child." 

** Perhaps $he^U think it won't do," Jean sug- 
gested as the footman went off. 

^^ Oh, she's as proud of her as I am I But if she 
doesn't approve, I'll take you upstairs. That'll be 
because, as you say, you're just the person. I 
haven't the least doubt of it — but you were 
going to tell me why." 



114 THB OTHBB HOtJSB 

Jean treated it as if it were almost a secret. 
^* Because she was born on my day/* 

"Your birthday?" 

" My biithday — the twenty-fourth." 

"Oh, I see; that's charming ~ that's delight* 
ful!" The circumstance had not quite all the 
subtlety she had beguiled him into looking fur, 
but her amusing belief in it, which left out all 
other sharers in the date, mingled oddly, to make 
him quickly feel that it had enough, with his 
growing sense that Mrs. Beever*s judgment of her 
hair was a libel. " It's a most extraordinary coin- 
cidence — it makes a most interesting tie. Do, 
therefore, I beg you, whenever you keep your 
anniversary, keep also a little hers." 

" That's just what I was thinking," said Jean. 
Then she added, still shy, yet suddenly almost 
radiant: "I shall always send her something!" 

" She shall do the same to you I " This idea 
had a charm even for Tony, who determined on 
the spot, quite sincerely, that he would, for the 
fii-st years at least, make it his own charge. 
" You're her very first friend," he smiled. 

"Am I?" Jean thought it wonderful news. 
" Before she has even seen me ! " 

"Oh, those are the first. You're * handed 
down,'" said Tony, humouring her. 



THB OTHBB H0U8X 116 

She evidently depiecated, however, any abate- 
ment of her rarity. ^Whj, I haven't seen her 
mother, either/' 

^* No, you haven't seen her mother. But you 
shall. And you have seen her father." 

^ Yes, I have seen her father." Looking at him 
as if to make sure of it, Jean gave this assertion 
the assent of a gaze so unrestricted that, feeling 
herself after an instant caught, as it were, in it, 
she turned abruptly away. 

It came back to Tony at the same moment, with 
a sort of coarseness, that he was to have sent her 
home ; yet now, somehow, as if half through the 
familiarity it had taken but these minutes to es- 
tablish, and half through a perception of her 
extreme juvenility, his reluctance to tell her so 
had dropped. ^ Do you know I'm under a sort of 
dreadful vow to Mrs. Beever?" Then as she 
faced him again, wondering : *^ She told me that 
if you should turn up I was to pack you off." 

Jean stared with a fresh alarm. ^ Ah, I shouldn't 
have stayed!" 

^ You didn't know it, and I couldn't show you 
the door." 

"Then I must go now." 

** Not a fait. I wouldn't have mentioned it — to 



116 THB OTHXB HOU8B 

consent to that. I mention it for just the other 
reason — to keep yon here as long as possible. 
I'll make it right with Cousin Kate/* Tony con- 
tinued. **rm not afraid of her!'* he laughed. 
** You produce an effect on me for which I'm par> 
ticularly gratefuL" She was acutely sensitive; 
for a few seconds she looked as if she thought he 
might be amusing himself at her expense. ^I 
mean you soothe me — at a moment when I really 
want it|" he said with a gentleness from which it 
gave him pleasure to see in her face an immediate 
impression. ^^I'm worried, I'm depressed, I've 
been threshing about in my anxiety. You keep 
me cool — you're just the right thing." He 
nodded at her in clear kindness. ^ Stay with me 
— stay with me I " 

Jean had not taken the flight of expressing a 
concern for his domestic situation, but in the pity 
that flooded her eyes at this appeal there was an 
instant surrender to nature. It was the sweetness 
of her youth that had calmed him, but in the re- 
sponse his words had evoked she already, on the 
spot, looked older. ^ Ah, if I eauld help you I " 
she timidly murmured. 

**Sit down again; sit down!" He turned 
away. ** Here's the wonder of the world!" he 



THB OTHER HOUSE 117 

exclaimed the next instant, seeing Gorham appear 
with her charge. His interest in the apparition 
almost simultaneously dropped, for Mrs. B^ver 
was at the opposite door. She had come back, 
and Ramage was with her: they stopped short 
together, and ho did the same on catching the 
direction, as he supposed, of his sharp neighbour's 
eyes. She had an air of singular intensity; it 
was peculiarly embodied in a look which, as she 
drew herself up, she shot straight past him and 
under the reprobation of which he glanced round 
to see Jean Martle turn pale. What he saw, how- 
ever, was not Jean Martle at all, but that very 
different person Rose Armiger, who, by an odd 
chance, and with Dennis Vidal at her side, pre- 
sented herself at this very juncture at the door of 
the vestibule. It was at Rose Mrs. Beever stared 
— stared with a significance doubtless produced 
by this young lady*s falsification of her denial that 
Mr. Vidal had been actively pursued. She took 
no notice of Jean, who, while the rest of them 
stood aboutt testified to her prompt compliance 
with any word of Tony*s by being the only mem- 
ber of the company in a chair. The sight of Mrs. 
Beever's face appeared to have deprived her of 
the force to rise. Tony observed these things in

a flash, and also how far the same Medosa-mask 
was from petrifying Rose Armiger, who, with a 
bright recoyery of zeal by which he himself was 
wonderstrack, launched without delay a conscien^ 
tious reminder of luncheon. It was on the table 
— it was spoiling — it was spoilt I Tony felt that 
he must gallantly support her. *^ Let us at last 
go in, then/* he said to Mrs. Beever. ^Let us 
go in/* he repeated to Jean and to Dennis VidaL 
"Doctor, you'll come too?'* 

He broke Jean's spell at a touch — she was on 
her feet ; but the Doctor raised, as if for general 
application, a deterrent, authoritaUve hand. ^ If 
you please. Bream — no banquet.*' He looked at 
Jean, at Rose, at Vidal, at Oorham. " I take the 
house in hand. We immediately subside.** 

Tony sprang to him. " Julia's worse? ** 

"No — she's the same." 

" Then I may go to her?** 

" Absolutely not" Doctor Ramage grasped his 
arm, linked his own in it, and held him. "If 
you're not a good boy I lock you up in your room. 
We immediately subside," he said again, address- 
ing the others ; " we go our respective ways, and 
we keep very still. The fact is, I require a hushed 
house. But before the hush descends Mrs. Beerer 
has something to say to you." 



THB OTHSB HOUSS 119 

She was on the other side of Tony, who felt, 
between them there, like their prisoner. She 
looked at her little audience, which consisted of 
Jean and Rose, of Mr. Vidal and the matronly 
Gorham. Gorham carried in her ample arms a 
large white sacrifice, a muslin-muffled o£Fering 
which seemed to lead up to a ceremony. ^* I have 
something to say to you because Doctor Ramage 
allows it, and because we are both under pledges 
to Mrs. Bream. It's a very peculiar announce- 
ment for me to have on my hands, but I've just 
passed her my promise, in the very strictest man- 
ner, to make it, before leaving the house, to every 
one it may concern, and to repeat it in certain 
other quarters.*' She paused again, and Tony, 
from his closeness to her, could feel the tremor 
of her solid presence. She disliked the awkward- 
ness and the coercion, and he was sorry for her, 
because by this time he well knew what was com- 
ing. He had guessed his wife's extraordinary pre- 
caution, which would have been almost grotesque 
if it hadn't been so infinitely touching. It seemed 
to him that he gave the measure of his indulgence 
for it in overlooking the wound to his delicacy 
conveyed in the publicity she imposed. He could 
condone this in a tender sigh, because it meant 



120 THS OTHXB HOU8S 

that in consequence of it she'd now poll round. 
^ She wishes it as generally known as possible," 
Mrs. Beever bronght out, *^that Mr. Bream, to 
gratify her at a crisis which I trust she exagger- 
ates, has assured her on his sacred honour that in 
the event of her death he will not again many.'* 

*^ In the lifetime of her daughter, that is," Doc- 
tor Ramage hastened to add. 

** In the lifetime of her daughter," Mrs. Beeyer 
as clearly echoed. 

^ In the lifetime of her daughter I " Tony him- 
self took up with an eztraYagance intended to 
offer the relief of a humorous treatment, if need 
be, to the bewildered young people whose embar- 
rassed stare was a prompt criticism of Julia's dis- 
cretion. It might have been in the spirit of a 
protest still more vehement that, at this instant, a 
small shrill pipe rose from the animated parcel 
with which Oorham, participating in the general 
awkwardness, had possibly taken a liberty. The 
comical little sound created a happy diversion; 
Tony sprang straight to the child. *^ So it m, my 
own," he cried, ^a scandal to be talking of *life- 
times ' I " He caught her from the affrighted nurse 
— he put his face down to hers with passion. 
Her wail ceased and he held her close to him ; for

a minute, iii silence, as if something deep went oat 
from him, he laid his cheek to her little cheek, 
burying his head under her veil. When he gave 
her up again, turning round, the hall was empty of 
every one save the Doctor, who signalled per- 
emptorily to Oorham to withdraw. Tony re- 
mained there meeting his eyes, in which, after an 
instant, the young man saw something that led 
him to exclaim: ^*How dreadfully ill she must 
be, Ramage, to have conceived a stroke in such 
taste I*' 

His companion drew him down to the sofa, pat» 
ting, soothing, supporting him. *^ You must bear 
it, my dear boy — you mast bear everything." 
Doctor Ramage &ltered. ^Your wife's exceed- 
ingly ill.'*

It continued to be, for the lady of Eastmead, 
as the years went on, a sustaining reflection that 
if in the matter of upholstery she yielded some- 
what stifiSy to the other house, so the other house 
was put out of all countenance by the mere breath 
of her garden. Tony could beat her indoors at 
every point ; but when she took her stand on her 
lawn she could defy not only Bounds but Wilver- 
ley. Her stand, and still more her seat, in the 
summer days, was frequent there, as we easily 
gather from the fortified position in which we 
next encounter her. From May to October she 
was out, as she said, at grass, drawing from it 
most of the time a comfortable sense that on such 
ground as this her young friend's love of newness 
broke down. He might make his dinner-service 
as new as he liked; she triumphed precisely in 
the fact that her trees and her shrubs were old.

creepers and clusters ; there was no velvet in his 
carpets like the velvet of her turf. She had 
everything, or almost everything — she had space 
and time and the river. No one at Wilverley 
had the river as she had it ; people might say of 
course there was little of it to have, but of what- 
ever there was she was in intimate possession. 
It skirted her grounds and improved her property 
and amused her guests ; she always held that her 
free access made up for being, as people said, 
on the wrong side of it. If she had not been on 
the wrong side she would not have had the 
little stone foot-bridge which was her special 
pride and the very making of her picture, and 
which she had heard compared — she had an off- 
hand way of bringing it in — to a similar feature 
of one of the celebrated ^ backs '* at Cambridge. 
The other side was the side of the other house, 
the side for the view — the view as to which she 
entertained the merely qualified respect excited 
in us, after the first creative flush, by mysteries 
of our own making. Mrs. Beever herself formed 
the view, and the other house was welcome to it, 
especially to those parts of it enjoyed through the 
rare gaps in an inter|)08ing leafy lane. Tony had a 
gate which he called his river-gate, but you didn't 



 127 

80 much as suspect the stream till you got well 
out of it. He had, on his further quarter, a 
closer contact with the town ; but this was just 
what she had, on both quarters, with the country. 
Her approach to the town was by the " long way " 
and the big bridge, and by going on, as she liked 
to do, past the Doctor's square red house. She 
hated stopping there, hated it as much as she 
liked his stopping at Eastmead; in the former 
case she seemed to consult him and in the latter 
to advise, which was the exercise of her wisdom 
that she decidedly preferred. Such degrees and 
dimensions, I hasten to add, had to do, altogether, 
with short relations and small things ; but it was 
just the good lady's reduced scale that held her 
little world together. So true is it that from 
strong compression the elements of drama spring, 
and that there are conditions in which they seem 
to invite not so much the opera-glass as the 
microscope. 

Never, perhaps, at any rate, had Mrs. Beever 
been more conscious of her advantages, or at least 
more surrounded with her conveniences, than on 
a beautiful afternoon of June on which we are 
again concerned with her. These blessings were 
partly embodied in the paraphernalia of tea, which 



128  

had cropped up, with promptness and profusion, 
in a sheltered comer of the lawn, and in the midst 
of which, waiting for custom, she might have been 
in charge of a refreshmentrstall at a fair. Every- 
thing at the other house struck her as later and 
later, and she only regretted that, as the protest 
of her own tradition, she couldn't move in the 
opposite direction without also moving from the 
hour. She waited for it now, at any rate, in 
the presence of a large red rug and a large white 
tablecloth, as well as of sundry basket-chairs and 
of a hammock that swayed in the soft west wind ; 
and she had meanwhile been occupied with a col- 
lection of parcels and pasteboard boxes that were 
heaped together on a bench. Of one of these 
parcels, enveloped in several layers of tissue- 
paper, she had just possessed herself, and, seated 
near her tea-table, was on the point of uncovering 
it. She became aware, at this instant, of being 
approached from behind ; on which, looking over 
her shoulder and seeing Doctor Ramage, she im- 
mediately stayed her hands. These friends, in a 
long acquaintance, had dropped by the way so 
many preliminaries that absence, in their inter* 
course, was a mere parenthesis, and conversation 
in general scarce began with a capital. But on 



THB OTHEB HOU8B 129 

this occasion the Doctor was floated to a seat not, 
as usual, on the bosom of the previous. 

*^ Guess whom I've just overtaken on your door- 
step. The young man you befriended four years 
ago — Mr. Vidal, Miss Armiger's flame I " 

Mrs. Beever fell back in her surprise ; it was rare 
for Mrs. Beever to fall back. *^He has turned 
up again !*' Her eyes had already asked more 
than her friend could tell. **For what in the 
world ?" 

*^ For the pleasure of seeing you. He has evi- 
dently retained a very grateful sense of what you 
did for him." 

*^ I did nothing, my dear man — I had to let it 
alone." 

"Tony's condition — of course I remember — 
again required you : you were immediately called 
back to the other house. But you gave him a 
shelter," said the Doctor, " that wretched day and 
that night, and he felt (it was evidently much to 
him) that, in his rupture with his young woman, 
you had the right instinct of the matter and were 
somehow on his side." 

" I put him up for a few hours — I saved him, 
in time, the embarrassment of finding himself in 
a house of death. But he took himself off the 



180  

next morning early — bidding me good-bye only 
in a quiet little note." 

*^A quiet little note which I remember you 
afterwards showed me, and which was a model 
of discretion and good taste. It seems to me," 
the Doctor went on, ^' that he doesn't violate those 
virtues in considering that you've given him the 
right to reappear." 

**At the very time, and the only time, in so 
long a period, that this young woman, as you 
call her, happens also to be again in the field ? " 

^* That's a coincidence," the Doctor replied, 
^^ far too singular for Mr. V idal to have had any 
forecast of it." 

"You didn't then tell him?" 

" I told him nothing save that you were proba- 
bly just where I find you, and that, as Manning 
is busy with her tea-things, I would come straight 
out for him and announce to you that he's there." 

Mrs. Beever's sense of complications evidently 
increased as she thought. " By ^ there ' do you 
mean on the doorstep ? " 

"Far from it. In the safest place in the world 
— at least when you're not in it." 

"In my own room?" Mrs. Beever asked. 

" In that austere monument to Domestic Method 



 181 

which you're sometimes pleased to call your bou- 
doir. I took upon myself to show him into it 
and to close the door on him there. I reflected 
that you'd perhaps like to see him before anyone 
else." 

Mrs. Beever looked at her visitor with appreci- 
ation. " You dear sharp thing ! " 

"Unless, indeed," the Doctor added, "they 
have, in so many years, already met." 

"She told me only yesterday they haven't." 

"I see. However, as I believe you consider 
tliat she never speaks the truth, that doesn't 
particularly count." 

"I hold, on the contrary, that a lie counts 
double," Mrs. Beever replied with decision. 

Doctor Ramage laughed. "Then why have 
you never in your life told one? I haven't even 
yet quite made out," he pursued, "why — espe- 
cially with Miss Jean here — you asked Miss 
Armiger down." 

"I asked her for Tony." 

"Because he suggested it? Yes, I know 
that." 

"I mean it," said Mrs. Beever, "in a sense 
I think you don't know." She looked at him 
a moment; but either her profundity or his 



182 THB OTHBB HOtTSB 

caution were too great, and he waited for her 
to commit herself farther. That was a thing 
she could always do rapidly without doing it 
recklessly. *^I asked her exactly on account of 
Jean.'* 

The Doctor meditated, but this seemed to 
deepen her depth. ^I give it up. TouVe 
mostly struck roe as so afraid of every other 
girl Paul looks at." 

Mrs. Beever's face was grave. ^^Yes, I have 
been; but Fm not so afraid of them as of those 
at whom Tony looks." 

Her interlocutor stared. *^He*s looking at 
Jean?" 

Mrs. Beever was silent a little. *^Not for the 
first time I" 

Her visitor also hesitated* *^And you think 
Miss Armiger ?'* 

Mrs. Beever took him up. ^^Miss Armiger*8 
better for him — since he tnuMt have somebody I " 

"You consider she'd marry him?" 

"She's insanely in love with him." 

The Doctor tilted up his chin; he uttered an 
expressive "Euhl — She is indeed, poor thing!" 
he said. "Since you frankly mention it, I as 
frankly agree with you, that I've never seen 



THB OTHBB HOU8B 188 

anything like it. And there isn't much I*ve not 
seen 1 But if Tony isn't crazy too ? " 

^It's a kind of craze that's catching. He 
must think of somebody or other," said Mrs. 
Beever. 

** I don't know what you mean by ^ thinking ' I 
Do you imply that the dear man, on what we 
know ?" The Doctor couldn't phrase it. 

His friend had greater courage. *^ Would 
break his yow and many again?" She turned 
it over; but at last she brought out: *^ Never 
in the world." 

^^Then how does the chance of his thinking 
of Rose help her?" 

^I don't say it helps her. I simply say it 
helps 9it«." 

Doctor Ramage was still mystified. **But if 
they can't marry ?" 

^^I don't care whether they marry or not I" 

She faced him with the bravery of this, and 
he broke into a happy laugh. ^^ I don't know 
whether most to admire your imagination or 
your morality." 

^^I protect my girl," she serenely declared. 

Doctor Ramage made his choice. ^^Oh, your 
moraUty I " 



184  

"In doing so," she went on, "I also protect 
my boy. That's the highest morality I know. 
ril see Mr. Vidal out here," she added. 

"So as to get rid of him easier?" 

" My getting rid of him will depend on what 
he wants. He must take, after all," Mrs. Beever 
continued, "his chance of meeting any embarrass- 
ment. If he plumps in without feeling his 
way " 

" It's his own affair — I see," the Doctor said. 
What he saw was that his friend's diplomacy had 
suffered a slight disturbance. Mr. Vidal was a 
new element in her reckoning ; for if, of old, she 
had liked and pitied him, he had since dropped 
out of her problem. Her companion, who timed 
his pleasures to the minute, indulged in one of 
his frequent glances at his watch. " I'll put it 
then to the young man — more gracefully than 
you do — that you'll receive him in this place." 
I shall be much obliged to you." 
But before I go," Doctor Ramage inquired, 
" where are all our friends ? " 

"I haven't the least idea. The only ones I 
count on are Effie and Jean." 

The Doctor made a motion of remembrance. 
"To be sure — it's their birthday: that fellow 






THE OTHBB HOUSE 185 

put it out of my head! The child's to come 
over to you to tea, and just what I stopped 
for " 

"Was to see if I had got your doll?" Mrs. 
Beever interrupted him by holding up the mufiSed 
parcel in her lap. She pulled away the papers. 
"Allow me to introduce the young lady." 

The young lady was sumptuous and ample; 
he took her in his hands with reverence. "She's 
splendid — she's positively human! I feel like a 
Turkish pasha investing in a beautiful Circassian. 
I feel, too," the Doctor went on, "how right I 
was to depend, in the absence of Mrs. Ramage, 
on your infallible taste." Then restoring the 
massive puppet: "Kindly mention how much 
I owe you." 

" Pay at the shop," said Mrs. Beever. " They 
* trusted' me." 

" With the same sense of security that I had ! " 
The Doctor got up. "Please then present the 
object with ray love and a kiss." 

"You can't come back to give it yourself?" 

" What do I ever give * myself,' dear lady, but 
medicine ? " 

"Very good," said Mrs. Beever; "the presen- 
tation shall be formal. But I ought to warn 



186 THB OTHBR H0U8S 

you that your beautiful Circassian will have 
been no less than the fourth.*' She glanced at 
the parcels on the bench. ^*I mean the fourth 
doll the child's to receive to-day.'* 

The Doctor followed the direction of her 
eyes. ^^It's a regular slave-market — a perfect 
hareem I '' 

«« We've each of us given her one. Each, that 
is, except Rose." 

**And what has Rose given her?" 

"Nothing at all." 

The Doctor thought a moment. " Doesn't she 
Uke her?" 

"She seems to wish it to be marked that she 
has nothing to do with her." 

Again Doctor Ramage reflected. "I see — 
that's very clever." 

Mrs. Beever, from her chair, looked up at 
him. "What do you mean by * clever'?" 

"I'll tell you some other time." He still 
stood before the bench. "There are no gifts 
for poor Jean?" 

"Oh, Jean has had most of hers." 

"But nothing from m«." The Doctor had 
but just thought of her; he turned sadly away. 
"I'm quite ashamed!" 



THE OTHER HOtJSE 137 

**You needn*t be," said Mrs. Beeyer. **She 
has also had nothing from Tony.'' 

He seemed struck. *' Indeed? On Miss 
Armiger's system ? " His friend remained silent, 
and he went on: ''That of wishing it to be 
marked that he has nothing to do with her?" 

Mrs. Beever, for a minute, continued not to 
reply; but at last she exclaimed: ''He doesn't 
calculate I " 

"That's bad — for a banker!" Doctor Ramage 
laughed. "What then has she had from Paul?" 

"Nothing either — as yet. That's to come 
this evening." 

"And what's it to be?" 

Mrs. Beever hesitated. " I haven't an idea." 

"Ah, you can fib I" joked her visitor, taking 
leave.

He crossed on his way to the house a tall par- 
lour-maid, who had just quitted it with a tray, 
which, a moment later, she deposited on the table 
near her mistress. Tony Bream was accustomed 
to say that since Frederick the Great's grenadiers 
there had never been anything like the Queen- 
mothcr*s piirlour-maids, who indeed on field-days 
might, in stature, uniform, and precision of exer- 
cise, have affronted comparison with that formida- 
ble phalanx. They were at once more athletic and 
more reserved than Tony liked to see their sex, 
and he was always sure that the extreme length 
of their frocks was determined by that of their 
feet. The young woman, at any rate, who now 
presented herself, a young woman with a large 
nose and a straight back, stiff cap-streamers, 
stiffer petticoats and stiffest niannei's, was plainly 
the corporal of her squad. Thcra was a murmur 

and a twitter all around her; but she rustled 

138 



 189 

about the tea-table to a tune that quenched the 
voice of summer. It left undisturbed, however, 
for a while, Mrs. Beever's meditations ; that lady 
was thoughtfully occupied in wrapping up Doctor 
Ramage's doll. " Do you know, Manning, what has 
become of Miss Armiger?" she at last inquired. 

^^She went, Ma'am, near an hour ago, to the 
pastrycook's." 

"To the pastrycook's?" 

"She had heard you wonder, Ma'am, she told 
me, that the young ladies' birthday-cake hadn't 
yet arrived." 

"And she thought she'd see about it? Un- 
commonly good of her I " Mrs. Beever exclaimed. 

"Yes, Ma'am, uncommonly good.' 

"Has it arrived, then, now? 

"Not yet. Ma'am.' 

"And Miss Armiger hasn't returned? 

"I think not, Ma'am.' 

Mrs. Beever considered again. " Perhaps she's 
waiting to bring it." 

Manning indulged in a proportionate pause. 
" Perhaps, Ma'am — in a fly. And when it comes, 
Ma'am, shall I fetch it out?" 

" In a fly too ? I'm afraid," said Mrs. Beever, 
"that with such an incubation it will really re-

quire one/' After a moment she added: ^Fll 
go in and look at it first/' And then, as her 
attendant was about to mstle away, she further 
detained her. ^^Mr. Bream hasn't been oyer?" 

" Not yet, Ma'am." 

Mrs. Beever consulted her watch. ^ Then he's 
still at the Bank." 

^^He must be indeed. Ma'am." 

Tony's colleague appeared for a little to ponder 
this prompt concurrence ; after which she said: 
"You haven't seen Miss Jean?" 

Manning bethought herself. " I believe. Ma'am, 
Miss Jean is dressing." 

**0h, in honour " But Mrs. Beever's 

idea dropped before she finished her sentence. 

Manning ventured to take it up. " In honour 
of her birthday, Ma'am." 

"I see — of course. And do you happen to 
have heard if that's what also detains Miss Effie 
— that she is dressing in honour of Aer«f" 

Manning hesitated. "I heard. Ma'am, this 
morning that Miss Effie had a slight cold." 

Her mistress looked surprised. " But not such 
as to keep her at home?" 

" They were taking extra care of her. Ma'am — 
so that she might be all right for coming." 



THB OTHER HOtJSE 141 

Mrs. Beeyer was not pleased. *^ Extra care? 
Then why didn't they send for the Doctor?" 

Again Manning hesitated. *'They sent for 
Miss Jean, Ma'am." 

^*To come and look after her?" 

^ They often do, Ma'am, you know. This morn- 
ing I took in the message." 

*^And Miss Jean obeyed it?" 

*^She was there an hour. Ma'am." 

Mrs. Beever administered a more than approv- 
ing pat to the final envelope of her doll. ^* She 
said nothing about it." 

Again Manning concurred. *^ Nothing, Ma'am." 
The word sounded six feet high, like the figure 
she presented. She waited a moment, and then, 
as if to close with as sharp a snap the last open 
door to the desirable, ^*Mr. Paul, Ma'am," she 
observed, *'if you were wanting to know, is out 
in his boat on the river." 

Mrs. Beever pitched her parcel back to the 
bench. *^Mr. Paul is never anywhere else!" 

*^ Never, Ma'am," said Manning inexorably. 
She turned the next instant to challenge the 
stranger who had come down from the house. 
*^A gentleman. Ma'am," she announced; and, 
retiring while Mrs. Beever rose to meet the vis- 



142 THB OTHBB H0U8X 

itor, she drew, with the noise of a lawn-mower, a 
starched tail along the grass. 

Dennis Vidal, with his hat off, showed his 
hostess a head over which not a year seemed to 
have passed. He had still his young, sharp, 
meagre look, and it came to her that the other 
time as well he had been dressed in double- 
breasted blue of a cut that made him sailorly* 
It was only on a longer view that she saw his 
special signs to be each a trifle intensified. He 
was browner, leaner, harder, finer ; he even struck 
her as more wanting in height These &cts, how- 
ever, didn*t prevent another fact from striking 
her still more: what was most distinct in his 
face was that he was really glad to take her by 
the hand. That had an instant effect on her: 
she could glow with pleasure, modest matron as 
she was, at such an intimation of her having, so 
many years before, in a few hours, made on a 
clever young man she liked an impression that 
could thus abide with him. In the quick light 
of it she liked him afresh ; it was as if their friend- 
ship put down on the spot a firm foot that was 
the result of a single stride across the chasm of 
time. In this indeed, to her clear sense there 
was even something more to pity him for ; it was 



THB OTHER HOUSE 148 

such a dreary little picture of his interval, such 
an implication of what it had lacked, that there 
had been so much room in it for an ugly old 
woman at Wilverley. She motioned him to sit 
down with her, but she immediately remarked 
that before she asked him a question she had an 
important fact to make known. She had delayed 
too long, while he waited there, to let him under- 
stand that Rose Armiger was at Eastmead. She 
instantly saw, at this, that he had come in com- 
plete ignorance. The range of alarm, in his face, 
was narrow ; but he coloured, looking grave ; 
and after a brief debate with himself he inquired 
as to Miss Armiger's actual whereabouts. 

*^She has gone out, but she may reappear at 
any moment," said Mrs. Beever. 

^And if she does will she come out here?" 

**T\e an impression she'll change her dress 
first. That may take her a little time." 

" Then I'm free to sit with you ten minutes ? " 

*' As long as you like, dear Mr. Vidal. It's for 
you to choose whether you'll avoid her." 

**I dislike dodging — I dislike hiding," Dennis 
returned; ^^but I daresay that if I had known 
where she was I wouldn't have come." 

**I feel hatefully rude — but you took a leap 



144 THB OTEUBB H0U8B 

in the dark. The absurd part of it,'' Mrs. Beever 
went on, **is that you've stumbled on her verjr 
first visit to me." 

The young man showed a surprise which gave 
her the measure of his need of illumination. 
"For these four years?" 

" For these four years. It's the only time she 
has been at Eastmead." 

Dennis hesitated. "And how often has she 
been at the other house?" 

Mrs. Beever smiled. " Not even once." Then 
as her smile broadened to a small, dry laugh, " I 
can quite say that for her I" she declared. 

Dennis looked at her hard. " To your certain 
knowledge ? " 

"To my certain and absolute knowledge." 
This mutual candour continued, and presently 
she said: "But you — where do you come from?" 

"From far away — I've been out of England. 
After my visit here I went back to my poet." 

"And now you've returned with your fortune?" 

He gave her a smile from which the friendliness 
took something of the bitter quality. "Call it 
my mtafortunel" There was nothing in this to 
deprive Mrs. Beever of the pleasant play of a 
professional sense that he had probably gathered 



THS OTHER HOUSE 145 

an independence that would have made him wel- 
come at the Bank. On the other hand she caught 
the note of a tired grimness in the way he added: 
^^Fve come back with that It sticks to me!" 

She spared him a minute. ^^You want her as 
much as ever?" 

His eyes confessed to a full and indeed to a 
sore acceptance of that expression of the degree. 
**' I want her as much as eyer. It's my constitu- 
tional obstinacy I" 

^' Which her treatment of you has done nothing 
to break down?" 

''To break down? It has done everything in 
life to build it up." 

''In spite of the particular circumstance ?" 

At this point eren Mrs. Beever's directness failed. 

That of her visitor, however, was equal to the 
occasion. "The particular circumstance of her 
chucking me because of the sudden glimpse given 
her by Mrs. Bream*s danger of the possibility of a 
far better match ? " He gave a laugh drier than 
her own had just been, the ring of an irony from 
which long, hard thought had pressed all the 
savour. "That 'particular circumstance,' dear 
Madam, is every bit that's the matter with 
mel" 



146 THB OTHBB HO0SB 

**Toa regard it with extraordinary coolness, 
but I presumed to allude to it ** 

** Because,*' Dennis broke in with lucidity, **I 
myself made no bones of doing so on the only 
other occasion on which we've met" 

*^The fact that we both equally saw^ that we 
both equally judged," said Mrs. Beever, ^* was on 
that occasion really the only thing that had time 
to pass between us. It's a tie, but it's a slender 
one, and I'm all the more flattered that it should 
have had any force to make you care to see me 
again." 

*^ It never ceased to be my purpose to see you, 
if you would permit it, on the first opportunity. 
My opportunity," the young man continued, ^ has 
been precipitated by an accident. I returned to 
England only last week, and was obliged two days 
ago to come on business to Southampton. There 
I found I should have to go, on the same matter, 
to Manington. It then appeared that to get to 
Marrington I must change at Plumbury " 

^ And Plumbury," said Mrs. Beever, ^^reminded 
you that you changed there, that it was from 
there you drove, on that horrible Sunday." 

*^It brought my opportunity home to me. 
Without wiring you or writing you, without 



THE OTHBB H0U8X 147 

sounding the ground or doing anything I ought 
to have done, I eimply embraced it I reached 
this place an hour ago and went to the inn.*' 

She looked at him wof uUy. ** Poor dear young 
man ! " 

He turned it off. ^ I do very well. Remember 
the places I've come from." 

**I don't care in the least where you've come 
from I If Rose weren't here I could put you up 
so beautifully." 

*^ Well, now that I know it," said Dennis after 
a moment, *^ I think I'm glad she's here. It's a 
fact the more to reckon with." 

^You mean to see her then?" 

He sat with his eyes fixed, turning it oyer. 
^You must tell me two or three things first 
Then I'll choose — 111 decide." 

She waited for him to mention his require- 
ments, turning to her teapot, which had been 
drawing, so that she could meanwhile hand him 
a cup. But for some minutes, taking it and stir- 
ring it, he only gazed and mused, as if his 
curiosities were so numerous that he scarcely 
knew which to pick out. Mrs. Beeyer at last, 
with a woman's sense for this, met him exactly 
at the right point ** I must tell you frankly that 



148 THB OTHBB HO08X 

if four years ago she was a girl most people 
admired ** 

He caught straight on. ^ She's still more 
wonderful now?** 

'^ Mrs. Beever distinguished. **I don't know 
about * wonderful'; but she wears really well. 
She carries the years almost as you do, and her 
head better than any young woman I've ever 
seen. Life is somehow becoming to her. Eyery 
one's immensely struck with her. She only needs 
to get what she wants. She has in short a charm 
that I recognise." 

Her visitor stared at her words as if they had 
been a framed picture ; the reflected colour of it 
made a light in his face. ^ And you speak as one 
who, I remember, doesn't like her." 

The lady of Eastmead faltered, but there was 
help in her characteristic courage. ^^No — I don't 
like her." 

*^ I see," Dennis considered. ^ May I ask then 
why you invited her?" 

'* For the most definite reason in the world. 
Mr. Bream asked me to." 

Dennis gave his hard smile. ^Do you do 
everything Mr. Bream asks?" 

''He asks so little!" 



THE OTHBB HOUSE 149 

^^Yes/' Dennis allowed — '^if that's a specimen! 
Does he like her still? '' he inquired. 

^^Just as much as ever." 

The young man was silent a little. **Do you 
mean he's in love with her?" 

"He never was — in any degree." 

Dennis looked doubtful. "Are you very 
sure?" 

"Well," said his hostess, "Fm sure of the 
present. That's quite enough. He's not in love 
with her now — I haye the proof." 

"The proof?" 

Mrs. Beever waited a moment. "His request 
in itself. If he were in love with her he never 
would have made it." 

There was a momentary appearance on her 
companion's part of thinking this rather too fine ; 
but he presently said: "You mean because he's 
completely held by his deathbed vow to his 
wife?" 

"Completely held." 

"There's no likelihood of his breaking it?" 

"Not the slightest." 

Dennis Vidal exhaled a low, long breath which 
evidently represented a certain sort of relief. 
"You're very positive; but I've a great respect 



160 THX OTHBB HOUBB 

for your judgment" He thought an instanti 
then he pursued abruptly: **Why did he wish 
her invited?" 

^ For reasons that, as he expressed them to me, 
struck me as natural enough. For the sake of 
old acquaintance — for the sake of his wife's 
memory." 

^He doesn't consider, then, that Mrs. Bream's 
obsession, as you term it, had been in any degree 
an apprehension of Rose?" 

""Why should he?" Mis. Beeyer asked. 
**Rose, for poor Julia, was on the point of 
becoming your wife." 

*'AhI for all that was to preyenti" Dennis 
ruefully exclaimed. 

'*It was to prevent little enough, but Julia 
never knew how little. Tony asked me a month 
ago if I thought he might without awkwardness 
propose to Miss Armiger a visit to the other 
house. I said * No, silly boy I ' and he dropped 
the question; but a week later he came back 
to it. He confided to me that he was ashamed, 
for so long, to have done so little for her; and 
she had behaved, in a difficult situation, with such 
discretion and delicacy that to have * shunted' 
her, as he said, so completely was a kind of 



THB OTHER nOUSE 161 

outrage to Julia's affection for ber and a slur 
upon hers for his wife. I said to him that if 
it would help him a bit I would address ber a 
suggestion that she should honour me with her 
company. He jumped at that, and I wrote. 
She jumped — and here she is." 

Poor Dennis, at this, gave a spring, as if the 
young lady had come into sight. Mrs. Beeyer 
reassured him, but he was on his feet and be 
stood before her. **This, then, is their first 
meeting ? *' 

^* Dear, no I they're met in London. He often 
goes up." 

"How often?" 

"Oh, irregularly. Sometimes twice a month." 

"And he sees her erery time?" 

Mrs. Beever considered. "Eyery time? I 
should think — hardly." 

"Then eyery other?" 

"I bayen't the least idea." 

Dennis looked round the garden. "You say 
you're conyinced that — in the face of his promise 
— he has no particular interest in her. You 
mean, howeyer, of course, but to the extent of 
marriage." 

" I mean," said Mrs. Beeyer, " to the extent of 



152 THB OTHEB HOUSE 

anything at alL" She also rose; she brought 
out her whole stoij. ^ He's in love with another 
person." 

*^Ah," Dennis murmured, ** that's none of my 
business I" He nevertheless closed his eyes an 
instant with the cool balm of it ^^ But it makes 
a lot of difference." 

She laid a kind hand on his arm. ^ Such a lot, 
I hope, then, that you'll join our little party?" 
He looked about him again, irresolute, and 
his eyes fell on the packages gathered hard by, 
of which the nature was betrayed by a glimpse 
of flaxen curls and waxen legs. She immediately 
enlightened him. ** Preparations for a birthday 
visit from the little girl at the other house. 
She's coming over to receive them." 

Again he dropped upon a seat : she stood there 
and he looked up at her. ^At last we've got 
to business I It's $he I've come to ask about." 

*^And what do you wish to ask?" 

^ How she goes on — I mean in health." 

" Not very well, I believe, just to-day I " Mrs. 
Beever laughed. 

" Just to-day ? " 

^ She's reported to have a slight cold. But 
don't be alarmed. In general she's splendid." 



 158 

He hesitated. *^Then you call it a good 
little life?" 

^* I call it a beautiful one I " 

" I mean she won't pop off? " 

*'I can't guarantee that," said Mrs. Beever. 
" But till she does " 

^^Till she does?" he asked as she paused. 

She paused a moment longer. ^^ Well — it's a 
comfort to see her. You'll do that for yourself." 

*^ I shall do that for myselfy" Dennis repeated. 
After a moment he went on: **To be utterly 
frank, it was to do it I came." 

*^And not to see mef Thank you I But I 
quite understand," said Mrs. Beever; *^you 
looked to me to introduce you. Sit still where 
you are, and I will." 

** There's one thing more I must ask you. 
You see; you know; you can tell me." He 
complied but a minute with her injunction; 
again, nervously, he was on his feet. ^^Is Miss 
Armiger in love with Mr. Bream?" 

His hostess turned away. *^ That's the one 
question I can't answer." Then she faced him 
again. ^'You must find out for yourself." 

He stood looking at her. **How shall I find 
out?" 



154 THE OTHBB HOUSB 

"By watching her." 

" Oh, I didn't come to do that I " Dennis, on 
hi8 side, turned away; he was visibly dissatis- 
fied. But he checked himself; before him rose 
a young man in boating flannels, who appeared 
to have come up from the river, who had ad- 
vanced noiselessly across the lawn, and whom 
Mrs. Beever introduced, without ceremony, as 
her " boy.*' Her boy blinked at Dennis, to whose 
identity he received no clue; and her visitor 
decided on a course. "May I think over what 
youVe said to me and come back?'* 

" I shall be very happy to see you again. But 
— in this poor place — what will you do ? '* 

Dennis glanced at the river, then he appealed to 
the young man. " Will you lend me your boat ? *' 

"It's niine^^^ said Mrs. Beever with decision. 
"You're welcome to it." 

"I'll take a little turn." Raising his hat, 
Dennis went rapidly down to the stream. 

Paul Beever looked after him. "Hadn't I 
better show him ? " he asked of his mother. 

"You had better sit right down there." She 
pointed with sharpness to the chair Dennis had 
quitted, and her son submissively took posses- 
sion of it.

Paul Bbeybr was tall and fat, and his eyes, 

like his mother's, were veiy small; but more 

even than to his mother nature had offered him 

a compensation for this defect in the extension 

of the rest of the face. He had large, bare, 

beardless cheeks and a wide, clean, candid mouth, 

which the length of the smooth upper lip caused 

to look as exposed as a bald head. He had a 

deep fold of flesh round his uncovered young 

neck, and his white flannels showed his legs to 

be all the way down of the same thickness. He 

promised to become massive early in life and 

even to attain a remarkable girth. His great 

tastes were for cigarettes and silence; but he 

was, in spite of his proportions, neither gross 

nor lazy. If he was indifferent to his figure he 

was equally so to his food, and he played cricket 

with his young townsmen and danced hard with 

their wives and sisters. Wilverley liked him

and Tony Bream thought well of him: it was 
only his mother who bad not yet made up her 
mind. He had done a good deal at Oxford 
in not doing any harm, and he had subse- 
quently rolled round the globe in the very groove 
with which she had belted it. But it was exactly 
in satisfying that he a little disappointed her: 
she had provided so against dangers that she 
found it a trifle dull to be so completely safe. 
It had become with her a question not of how 
clever he was, but of how stupid. Tony had 
expressed the view that he was distinctly deep, 
but that might only have been, in Tony's florid 
way, to show that he himself was so. She would 
not have found it convenient to have to give the 
boy an account of Mr. Vidal; but now that, 
detached from her purposes and respectful of her 
privacies, he sat there without making an inquiiy, 
she was disconcerted enough slightly to miss the 
opportunity to snub him. On this occasion, how- 
ever, she could steady herself with the possibility 
that her hour would still come. He began to eat 
a bun — his row justified that; and meanwhile 
she helped him to his tea. As she handed him 
the cup she challenged him with some sharpness. 
*'Pray, when are you going to give it?'* 



THE OTHER HOUBB 167 

He slowly masticated while he looked at her. 
""When do you think I had better?" 

^* Before dinner — distinctly. One doesn't know 
what may happen.'* 

"Do you think anything at aU will?" he 
placidly asked. 

His mother waited before answering. ** Noth- 
ing, certainly, unless you take some trouble for 
it." His perception of what she meant by this 
was clearly wanting, so that after a moment she 
continued: "You don't seem to grasp that I've 
done for you all I can do, and that the rest now 
depends on yourself." 

" Oh yes, mother, I grasp it," he said without 
irritation. He took another bite of his bun, and 
then he added: "Miss Armiger has made me 
quite do that." 

"Miss Armiger?" Mrs. Beever stared; she 
even felt that her opportunity was at hand. 
"What in the world has $he to do with the 
matter?" 

" Why, Fve talked to her a lot about it." 

" Tou mean she has talked to you a lot, I sup- 
pose. It's immensely like her." 

** It's like my mother — that's whom it*s like," 
said Paul. "She takes just the same view as 



168 THB OTHER HOU8B 

yourself. I mean the view that Fve a great 
opening and that I must make a great effort'* 

**And don't you see that for yourself? Do 
you require a pair of women to tell you ? " Mrs. 
Beever asked. 

Paul, looking g^ye and impartial, turned her 
question over while he stirred his tea. ^ No, not 
exactly. But Miss Armiger puts eveiything so 
welL" 

*^She puts some things doubtless beautifully. 
Still, I should like you to be conscious of some 
better reason for making yourself acceptable to 
Jean than that another young woman, however 
brilliant, recommends it." 

The young man continued to ruminate, and it 
occurred to his mother, as it had occurred before, 
that his imperturbability fc<u perhaps a strength. 
^I am," he said at last. **She seems to make 
clear to me what I feel." 

Mrs. Beever wondered* ^ You mean of course 
Jean does." 

**Dear no — Miss Armiger I" 

The lady of Eastmead laughed out in her im- 
patience. *^I'm delighted to hear you feel any- 
thing. Ton haven't often seemed to me to feel." 

*^I feel that Jean's vexy charming." 



THB OTHEB H0U8B 169 

She laughed again at the way he made it 
sound. *^ Is that the tone in which you think of 
telling her so?" 

^^ I think she'll take it from me in any tone," 
Paul replied. ^^She has always been most kind 
to me; we're very good friends, and she knows 
what I want." 

*^ It's more than I do, my dear I That's ex- 
actly what you said to me six months ago — 
when she liked you so much that she asked you 
to let her alone." 

**She asked me to give her six months for a 
definite answer, and she likes me the more for 
having consented to do that," said Paul. **The 
time I've waited has improved our relations." 

^^Well, then, they now must have reached 
perfection. You'll get her definite answer, there- 
fore, this very afternoon." 

^When I present the ornament?** 

**When you present the ornament. You've 
got it safe, I hope?" 

Paul hesitated; he took another bun. **I im- 
agine it's all right." 

*^ Do you only ^ imagine ' — with a thing of that 
value? What have you done with it?" 

Again the young man faltered. ^^I've given 



160  

it to Miss Armiger. She was afraid I'd lose 
it'* 

^And you were not afraid 9he would?" his 
mother cried. 

*^Not a bit She's to give it back to me on 
this spot She wants me too much to succeed." 

Mrs. Beever was silent a little. ^^And how 
much do you want her to?" 

Paul looked blank. ''In what?" 

'' In making a fool of you." Mrs. Beever gath- 
ered herself. '' Are you in love with Rose Armi- 
ger, Paul?" 

He judiciously considered the question. '' Not 
in the least I talk with her of nobody and noth- 
ing but Jean." 

''And do you talk with Jean of nobody and 
nothing but Rose?" 

Paul appeared to make an effort to remember. 
" I scarcely talk with her at all. We're such old 
friends that there's almost nothing to say." 

" There's tUs to say, my dear — that you take 
too much for granted I" 

"That's just what Miss Armiger tells me. 
Give me, please, some more tea." His mother 
took his cup, but she looked at him hard and 

He bore it without meeting her 



TH£ OTHBB HOUBB 161 

eyes, only turning his own pensively to the differ^ 
ent dainties on the table. *^ If I do take a great 
deal for granted," he went on, ^^ you must remem- 
ber that you brought me up to it." 

Mrs. Beever found only after an instant a reply. 
Then, however, she uttered it with an air of 
triumph. **I may have brought you up — but I 
didn't bring up Jean I " 

** Well, it*s not of her I'm speaking," the young 
man good-humouredly rejoined ; *^ though I might 
remind you that she has been here again and 
again, and month after month, and has always 
been taught — so far as you could teach her — 
to regard me as her inevitable fate. Have you 
any real doubt," he went on, ^ of her recognising 
in a satisfactoiy way that the time has come?" 

Mrs. Beever transferred her scrutiny to the 
interior of her teapot **NoI" she said after a 
moment* 

""Then what's the matter?" 

** The matter is that I'm nervous, and that your 
stolidity makes me so. I want you to behave to 
me as if you cared — and I want you still more 
to behave so to A^r." Paul made, in his seat, a 
movement in which his companion caught, as she 
supposed, the betrayal of a sense of oppression; 



162 TEDS OTHER HOUSB 

and at this her own worst fear broke out. ^ Oh, 
don't tell me you dinCt care — for if you do I 
don't know what I shall do to you I '* He looked 
at her with an air he sometimes had, which 
always aggravated her impatience, an air of 
amused surprise, quickened to curiosity, that 
there should be in the world organisms capable 
of generating heat. She had thanked God, 
through life, that she was cold-blooded, but now 
it seemed to face her as a Nemesis that she was 
a volcano compared with her son. This trans- 
ferred to him the advantage she had so long 
monopolised, that of always seeing, in any relation 
or discussion, the other party become the spectar 
cle, while, sitting back in her stall, she remained 
the spectator and even the critic. She hated to 
perform to Paul as she had made others perform 
to herself; but she determined on the instant 
that, since she was condemned to do so, she 
would do it to some purpose. She would have 
to leap through a hoop, but she would land on 
her charger's back. The next moment Paul was 
watching her while she shook her little flags at 
him. ^^ There's one thing, my dear, that I can 
give you my word of honour for — the fact that 
if the influence that congeals, that paralyses you

happens by any chance to be a dream of what 
may be open to you in any other quarter, the 
sooner you utterly dismiss that dream the better 
it will be not only for your happiness, but for 
your dignity. If you entertain — with no matter 
how bad a conscience — a vain fancy that you've 
the smallest real chance of making the smallest 
real impression on anybody ebe, all I can say is 
that you prepare for yourself very nearly as 
much discomfort as you prepare disgust for your 
mother." She paused a moment; she felt, before 
her son's mild gape, like a trapezist in pink tights. 
^^ How much susceptibility, I should like to know, 
has Miss Armiger at her command for your great 
charms?" 

Paul showed her a certain respect; he didn't 
clap her — that is, he didn't smile. He felt some- 
thing, however, which was indicated, as it always 
was, by the way his eyes grew smaller: they con- 
tracted at times, in his big, fair face, to mere little 
conscious points. These points he now directed 
to the region of the house. ** Well, mother," he 
quietly replied, *^if you would like to know it 
hadn't you better ask her directly?" Rose Armi- 
ger had come into view; Mrs. Beever, turning, 
saw her approach, bareheaded, in a fresh white 



164 TH3B OTHEB HOUSB 

dress, under a showy red parasol. PauU as she 
drew near, left his seat and strolled to the ham- 
mock, into which he meditatiyelj dropped. Ex- 
tended there, while the great net bulged and its 
attachments cracked with his weight, he spoke 
with the same plain patience. *^She has come 
to give me up the ornament."

^The great cake has at last airiyed, dear 
lady I*' Rose gaily announced to Mrs. Beever, 
who waited, before acknowledging the news, long 
enough to suggest to her son that she was per- 
haps about to act on his advice. 

^ I'm much obliged to you for having gone to 
see about it,'' was, however, what, after a moment, 
Miss Armiger's hostess elected to reply. 

'at was an irresistible service. I shouldn't have 
got over on such a day as this," said Rose, ^ the 
least little disappointment to dear little Jean." 

** To say nothing, of course, of dear little Effie," 
Mrs. Beever promptly rejoined. 

'^ It comes to the same thing — the occasion so 
mixes them up. They're interlaced on the cake 
— with their initials and their candles. There 
are plenty of candles for each," Rose laughed, 
*'for their years have been added together. It 
makes a very pretty number I" 

106 



166 THE OTHIIB H0U8B 

^* It must also make a veiy big cake," said Mis. 
Beever. 

•* Colossal/' 

" Too big to be brought out ? " 

The girl considered. " Not so big, you know," 
she archly replied, ^^as if the candles had to be 
yours and mine I" Then holding up the ^^omar 
ment" to Paul, she said: ^*I surrender you my 
trust. — Catch!" she added, with decision, mak- 
ing a movement to toss him a small case in red 
morocco, which, the next moment, in its flight 
through the air, without altering his attitude, he 
intercepted with one hand. 

Mrs. Beever's excited mistrust dropped at the 
mere audacity of this: there was something per- 
ceptibly superior in the girl who could meet half- 
way, so cleverly, a suspicion she was quite con- 
scious of and much desired to dissipate. The 
lady of Eastmead looked at her hard, reading her 
desire in the look she gave back. ^^ Trust me, 
trust me," her eyes seemed to plead; ^* don't at 
all events think me capable of any self-seeking 
that's stupid or poor. I may be dangerous to my- 
self, but I'm not so to others ; least of all am I so 
to you." She had a presence that was, in its way, 
like Tony Bream's : it made, simply and directly. 



THE OTHEB HOTTSB 167 

a difference in any peiBonal question exposed to 
it. Under its action, at all events, Mrs. Beever 
found herself suddenly feeling that she could 
after all trust Rose if she could only trust Paul. 
She glanced at that young man as he lay in the 
hammock, and saw that in spite of the familiarity 
of his posture — which indeed might have been 
assumed with a misleading purpose — his dimin- 
ished pupils, fixed upon their visitor, still had 
the expression imparted to them by her own last 
address. She hesitated; but while she did so 
Rose came straight up to her and kissed her. It 
was the very first time, and Mrs. Beever blushed 
as if one of her secrets had been surprised. Rose 
explained her impulse only with a smile ; but the 
smile said vividly: **I'll polish him off!" 

Thb brought a response to his mother's lips. 
^ 111 go and inspect the cake ! " 

Mrs. Beever took her way to the house, and as 
soon as her back was turned her son got out of 
the hammock. An observer of the scene would 
not have failed to divine that, with some pro- 
fundiiy of calculation, he had taken refuge there 
as a mute protest against any frustration of his 
interview with Rose. This young lady herself 
laughed out as she saw him rise, and her laugh

would have been, for the same observer, a tribate 
to the natural art that was mingled with his 
obvious simplicity. Paul himself recognised its 
bearing and, as he came and stood at the tea-table, 
acknowledged her criticism by saying quietly: 
*^I was afraid my mother would take me away.'* 

*^0n the contraiy; she has formally sur- 
rendered you." 

^^Then you must let me perform her office 
and help you to some tea." 

He spoke with a rigid courtesy that was not 
without its grace, and in the rich shade of her 
umbrella, which she twirled repeatedly on her 
shoulder, she looked down with detachment at 
the table. **I'll do it for myself, thank you; 
and I should like you to return to your ham- 
mock." 

**I left it on puipose," the young man said. 
^^Flat on my back, that way, Fm at a sort of 
disadvantage in talking with you." 

** That's precisely why I make the request. I 
wish you to be flat on your back and to have 
nothing whatever to reply." Paul immediately 
retraced his steps, but before again extending 
himself he asked her, with the same grave con- 
sideration, where in this case she would be 



THB OTHER HOUSE 169 

seated. **I sha'n't be seated at all,'* she an- 
swered; ^^m walk aboat and stand over you 
and bully you." He tumbled into his net, sitting 
up rather more than before; and, coming close 
to it, she put out her hand. *^Let me see that 
object again." He had in his lap the little box 
he had received from her, and at this he passed 
it back. She opened it, pressing on the spring, 
and, inclining her head to one side, considered 
afresh the mounted jewel that nestled in the 
white velvet. Then, closing the case with a 
loud snap, she restored it to him. ^^Yes, it's 
very good ; it's a wonderful stone, and she knows. 
But that alone, my dear, won't do it." She 
leaned, facing him, against the tense ropes of 
the hammock, and he looked up at her. ^*Tou 
take too much for granted." 

For a moment Paul answered nothing, but at 
last he brought out: ^* That's just what I said 
to my mother you had already said when she 
said just the same." 

Rose stared an instant; then she smiled again. 
^^It's complicated, but I follow you! She has 
been waking you up.*' 

**She knows," said her companion, ^Hhat you 
advise me in the same sense as herself." 



170 THB OTHBB H0U8B 

^^She believes it at last — ber leaving us to- 
gether was a sign of tbat. I bave at beart per- 
fectly to justify ber confidence, for bitberto sbe

pose tbat, in tbese tbree weeks, yon bad been so 
tiresome as to &11 in love witb me." 

^*I particularly told ber I baven't at all.*' 

Paul's tone bad at its moments of bigbest 
gravity tbe gift of moving almost any interlocutor 
to mirtb. *^I bope you'll be more convincing 
tban tbat if you ever particularly tell anyone

and be swung tbere gently a minute. 

^* Tou mustn't ask too mucb of me, you know," 
be finally said, watcbing ber as sbe went to tbe 
table and poured out a cup of tea. 

Sbe drank a little and tben, putting down 
tbe cup, came back to bim. **I sbould be ask- 
ing too mucb of you only if you were asking 
too mucb of her. You're so far from tbat, and 
your position's so perfect. It's too beautiful, 
you know, wbat you offer." 

**I know wbat I offer, and I know wbat I 
don't^" Paul returned; ^and tbe person we 
speak of knows exactly as well. All tbe ele-

ments are before her, and if my position's so 
fine it's there for her to see it, quite as well 
as for you. I agree with you that I'm a decent 
sort, and that, as things are going, my business, 
my prospects, my guarantees of one kind and 
another, are substantial. But just these things, 
for years, have been made familiar to her, and 
nothing, without a risk of greatly boring her, 
can very well be added to the account. Tou 
and my mother say I take too much for granted ; 
but I take only that." This was a long speech 
for our young man, and his want of accent, his 
passionless pauses, made it seem a trifle longer. 
It had a visible effect on Rose Armiger, whom 
he held there with widening eyes as he talked. 
There was an intensity in her face, a bright 
sweetness that, when he stopped, seemed to give 
itself out to him as if to encourage him to go on. 
But he went on only to the extent of adding: 
** All I mean is that if Fm good enough for her 
she has only to take me." 

*^ You're good enough for the best girl in the 
world," Rose said with the tremor of sincerity. 
^'You're honest and kind; you're generous and 
wise." She looked at him with a sort of intelli- 
gent pleasure, that of a mind fine enough to be 



172 THB OTHXB HOT78X 

touched by an exhiUtion of beaaty even the 
most occult. ** You're 00 sound — you're so safe 
that it makes any relation with you a real luxury 
and a thing to be grateful for." She shed on 
him her sociable approval, treating him as a 
happy product, speaking of him as of another 
person. ** I shall always be glad and proud that 
you've been, if only for an hour, my friend!" 

Paul's response to this demonstration consisted 
in getting slowly and heavily on his feet. ^* Do 
you think I like what you do to me ? " he abruptly 
demanded. 

It was a sudden new note, but it found her 
quite ready. **I don't care whether you like it 
or not! It's my duty, and it's yours — it's the 
right thing." 

He stood there in his tall awkwardness; he 
spoke as if he had not heard her. ^It's too 
strange to have to take it from you." 

*^ Evetything's strange — and the truest things 
are the strangest. Besides, it isn't so extraordi- 
nary as that comes to. It isn't as if you had an 
objection to her ; it isn't as if she weren't beauti- 
ful and good — really cultivated and altogether 
charming. It isn't as if, since I first saw her 
here, she hadn't developed in the most admirable 



THE OTHER H0XT8B 178 

way, and also hadn't, by her father's death, come 
into three thousand a year and into an oppoiv 
tonity for looking, with the red gold of her 
hair, in the deepest, daintiest, freshest moarning, 
lovelier far, my dear boy, than, with all respect, 
any girl who can ever have strayed before, or 
ever will again, into any Wilverley bank. It 
isn't as if, granting you do care for me, there 
were the smallest chance, should you tiy to 
make too much of it, of my ever doing anything 
but listen to you with a pained *0h, dear!' pat 
you affectionately on the back, and push you 
promptly out of the room." Paul Beever, when 
she thus encountered him, quitted his place, 
moving slowly outside the wide cluster of chairs, 
while Rose, within it, turned as he turned, press* 
ing him with deeper earnestness. He stopped 
behind one of the chairs, holding its high back 
and now meeting her eyes. ^^ If you do care for 
me," she went on with her warm voice, ^^ there's 
a magnificent way you can show it. Tou can 
show it by putting into your appeal to Miss 
Martle something that she can't resbt." 

*^And what may she not be able to resist?" 
Paul inquired, keeping his voice steady, but 
shaking his chair a little. 



174 THE OTHER HOTJSB 

** Why, you — if you'll only be a bit personal, 
a bit passionate, have some appearance of really 
desiring her, some that your happiness really 
depends on her." Paul looked as if he were 
taking a lesson, and she gave it with growing 
assurance. ^^Show her some tenderness, some 
eloquence, try some touch of the sort that goes 
home. Speak to her, for God's sake, the words 
that women like. We all like them, and we all 
feel them, and you can do nothing good without 
them. Keep well in sight that what you must 
absolutely do is please her." 

Paul seemed to fix his little eyes on this aim. 
** Please her and please you." 

^ It sounds odd, yes, lumping us together. But 
that doesn't matter," said Rose. ^^ The effect of 
your success will be that you'll unspeakably help 
and comfort me. It's difficult to talk about it — 
my grounds are so deep, deep down." She hesi- 
tated, casting about her, asking herself how far 
she might go. Then she decided, growing a 
little pale with the e^rt. *^I've an idea that 
has become a passion with me. There's a right 
I must see done — there's a wrong I must make 
impossiUe. There's a loyalty I must cherish — 
there's a memoiy I must protect. That's all I

can say.'' She stood there in her vivid meaning 
like the priestess of a threatened altar. *^ If that 
girl becomes yonr wife — why, then Fm at last 
at rest!** 

** Ton get, by my achievement, what you want 
— I see. And, please, what do / get?" Paul 
presently asked. 

**Tou?" The blood rushed back to her face 
with the shock of this question. ^^Why, you 
get Jean Martlel" He turned away without a 
word, and at the same moment, in the distance, 
she saw the person whose name she had just 
uttered descend the great square steps. She 
hereupon slipped through the circle of chairs and 
rapidly met her companion, who stopped short 
as she approached* Rose looked him straight in 
the eyes. ** If you give me the peace I pray for, 
m do anjrthing for you in life I " She left him 
staring and passed down to the river, where, on 
the little bridge, Tony Bream was in sight, wav- 
ing his hat to her as he came from the other 
house.

Boss Abmioeb, in a few moments, was joined 
bj Tony, and they came up the lawn together to 
where Jean Martle stood talking with PanL 
Here, at the approach of the master of Bounds, 
this young lady anxiously inquired if Effie had 
not been well enough to accompany him. She 
had expected to find her there; then, failing 
that, had taken for granted he would bring her. 

**I'ye left the question, my dear Jean, in her 
nurse's hands," Tony said. *^ She had been bedi- 
zened from top to toe, and then, on some slight 
appearance of being less well, had been despoiled, 
denuded, and disappointed. She's a poor little 
lamb of sacrifice. They were at her again, when 
I came away, with the ribbons and garlands ; but 
there was apparently much more to come, and 
I couldn't answer for it that a single sneeze 
wouldn't again lay everything low. It's in the 

bosom of the gods. I couldn't wait"

**Tou were too impatient to be with tw/' 
Rose suggested. 

Tony, with a successful air of veij light com- 
edy, smiled and inclined himself. ^^I was too 
impatient to be with ycm, Miss Armiger.'' The 
lapse of four years still presented him in such 
familiar mourning as might consort with a coun- 
try nook on a summer afternoon; but it also 
allowed undiminished relief to a manner of ad- 
dressing women which was clearly instinctive 
and habitual, and which, at the same time, by 
good fortune, had the grace of flatteiy without 
phrases and of irony without impertinence. He 
was a little older, but he was not heavier; he 
was a little worn, but he was not worn dull. His 
presence was, anywhere and at any time, as much 
as ever the clock at the moment it strikes. Paul 
Beever's little eyes, after he appeared, rested on 
Rose with an expression which might have been 
that of a man counting the waves produced on 
a sheet of water by the plunge of a large object. 
For any like ripple on the fine surface of the 
younger girl he appeared to have no attention. 

^ Tm glad that remark's not addressed to m^,'* 
Jean said gaily ; ^ for I'm afraid I must immedi- 
ately withdraw from you the light of my society." 



178 THE OTHER HOUBB 

^ On whom then do joa mean to bestow it ? " 

^ On your daughter, this moment. I must go 
and judge for myself of her condition." 

Tony looked at her more seriously. ^ If you're 
at all really troubled about her I'll go back with 
you. TouVe too beautifully kind : they told me 
of your having been with her this morning.'* 

*^ Ah, you were with her this morning ? " Rose 
asked of Jean in a manner to which there was a 
clear effort to impart the intonation of the casual, 
but which had in it something that made the 
person addressed turn to her with a dim surprise. 
Jean stood there in her black dress and her fair 
beauty; but her wonder was not of a sort to 
cloud the extraordinaiy radiance of her youth. 
"For ever so long. Don't you know Fve made 
her my peculiar and exclusive charge ? " 

" Under the pretext," Tony went on, to Rose, 
" of saving her from perdition. I'm supposed to 
be in danger of spoiling her, but Jean treats her 
quite a$ spoiled ; which is much the greater injury 
of the two." 

" Don't go back, at any rate, please," Rose said 
to him with soft persuasion. " I never see you, 
you know, and I want just now particularly to 
speak to you." Tony instantly expressed sub- 



 179 

mission, and Rose, checking Jean, who, at this, 
in silence, turned to take her way to the bridge, 
reminded Paul Beever that she had just heard 
from him of his having, on his side, some special 
purpose of an interview with Miss Martle. 

At this Paul grew very red. "Oh yes, I 
should rather like to speak to you, please," he 
said to Jean. 

She had paused half-way down the little slope ; 
she looked at him frankly and kindly. 

" Do you mean immediately ? " 

"As soon as you've time." 

"I shall have time as soon as I've been to 
Effie," Jean replied. " I want to bring her over. 
There are four doUs waiting for her." 

"My dear child," Rose familiarly exclaimed, 
"at home there are about forty I Don't you 
give her one every day or two?" she went on 
to Tony. 

Her question didn't reach him; he was too 
much interested in Paul's arrangement with Jean, 
on whom his eyes were fixed. "Go, then — to 
be the sooner restored to us* And do bring the 
kid!" He spoke with jollity. 

" I'm going in to change — perhaps I shall 
presently find you here," Paul put in. 



180 THB OTHBB HOUSE 

^^Toa'U certainly find me, dear Paul. I shall 
be quick I " the girl called back. And she lightly 
went her way, while Paul walked off to the house 
and the two others, standing together, watched 
her a minute. In spite of her black dress, of 
which the thin, voluminous tissue fluttered in 
the summer breeze, she seemed to shine in the 
afternoon light. They saw her reach the bridge, 
where, in the middle, she turned and tossed back 
at them a wave of her handkerchief; after which 
she dipped to the other side and disappeared. 

^* Mayn't I give you some tea?*' Rose said to 
her companion. She nodded at the bright display 
of Mrs. Beever's hospitality; Tony gratefully ac- 
cepted her offer and they strolled on side by side. 
^ Why have you ceased to call me * Rose * ? '* she 
then suddenly demanded. 

Tony started so that he practically stopped; 
on which she promptly halted. ^Hdve I, my 

dear woman? I didn't know " He looked 

at her and, looking at her, he after a moment 
markedly coloured: he had the air of a man 
who sees something that operates as a warning. 
What Tony Bream saw was a circumstance of 
which he had already had glimpses; but for 
some reason or other it was now written with a 



THB OTHER HOTJBB 181 

largeness that made it resemble a printed poster 
on a wall. It might have been, from the way 
he took it in, a big yellow advertisement, to the 
publieity of whose message no artifice of type 
was wanting. This message was simply Rose 
Armiger's whole face, exquisite and tragic in its 
appeal, stamped with a sensibility that was almost 
abject, a tenderness that was more than eager. 
The appeal was there, for an instant, with rare 
intensity, and what Tony felt in response to it he 
felt without fatuity or vanity. He could meet 
it only with a compassion as unreserved as itself. 
He looked confused, but he looked kind, and his 
companion's eyes lighted as with the sense of 
something that at last even in pure pity had 
come out to her. It was as if she let him know 
that since she had been at Eastmead nothing 
whatever had come out. 

** When I was at Bounds, four years ago,'' she 
said, ^*you called me ^Rose' and you called our 
friend there — " she made a movement in the 
direction Jean had taken — ^^ nothing at all. 
Now you call her by her name, and you call 
me nothing at all." 

Tony obligingly turned it over. ^* Don't I call 
you ^Miss Armiger'?" 



182 THB OTHBB HOUSE 

**l8 that anything at all?" Rose effect! vely 
asked. ^^ You're conscious of some great differ^ 
ence." 

Tony hesitated ; he walked on. *^ Between you 
and Jean?" 

^ Oh, the difference between me and Jean goes 
without saying. What I mean is the difference 
between my having been at Wilverley then and 
my being here now." 

They reached the tea-table, and Tony, dropping 
into a chair, removed his hat. ^^What have I 
called you when we've met in London?" 

She stood before him, closing her parasol. 
^ Don't you even know ? You've called me noth* 
ing." She proceeded to pour out tea for him, 
busying herself delicately with Mrs. Beever's 
wonderful arrangements for keeping things hot. 
^ Have you by any chance been conscious of what 
I've called you/" she said. 

Tony let himself, in his place, be served. 
*^ Doesn't everyone in the wide world call me 
the inevitable ^Tony'? The name's dreadful — 
for a banker : it should have been a bar, for me, 
to that career. It's fatal to dignity. But then 
of course I haven't any dignity." 

^I think you haven't much," Rose replied. 



THB OTHER HOUSB 188 

**' But I've never seen anyone get on so well with- 
out it. And, after all, you've just enough to 
make Miss Martle recognise it." 

Tony wondered. ^^By calling me *Mr. Bream'? 
Oh, for her I'm a greybeard — and I address her 
as one. I address her as I addressed her as a 
child. Of course I admit," he added with an 
intention vaguely pacific, ^Hhat she has entirely 
ceased to be that." 

^* She's wonderful," said Rose, handing him 
something buttered and perversely cold. 

He assented even to the point of submissively 
helping himself. ^^ She's a tremendous dear." 

*^I mean she's wonderful about your little 
girl." 

«« Devoted, isn't she? That dates from long 
ago. She has a special sentiment about her." 

Rdse was silent a moment. ^^It's a little life 
to preserve and protect," she then said. ^*Of 
course I " 

««Why, to that degree that she seems scarcely 
to think the child safe even with its infatuated 
daddy I " 

Still on her feet beyond the table near which 
he sat, she had put up her parasol again, and she 
looked across at him from under it. Their eyes 



184 THS OTHSB H0U8B 

meti and he again felt himself in the presence of 
what, in them, shortly before, had been so deep, 
so exquisite. It represented something that no 
lapse could long quench — something that gave 
out the measureless white ray of a light steadily 
reyolving. She could sometimes turn it away, 
but it was always somewhere ; and now it covered 
him with a great cold lustre that made every- 
thing, for the moment, look hard and ugly — 
made him also feel the chill of a complication for 
which he had not allowed. He had had plenty of 
complications in life, but he had likewise had 
ways of dealing with them that were in general 
clever, easy, masterly — indeed often really pleas- 
ant He got up nervously: there would be 
nothing pleasant in any way of dealing with 
this one. 



xvm 

CoKSOlous of the importance of not letting 
his nervousness show, Tony had no sooner point- 
lessly risen than he took possession of another 
chair. He dropped the question of Effie's 
security, remembering there was a prior one 
as to which he had still to justify himself. 
He brought it back with an air of indulgence 
which scarcely disguised, however, ita present 
air of irrelevance. ^Tll gladly call you, my 
dear Rose, anything you like, but you mustn't 
think IVe been capricious or disloyal. I ad- 
dressed you, of old — at the last — in the way in 
which it seemed most natural to address so close 
a friend of my wife's. But I somehow think 
of you here now rather as a friend of my own." 

** And that makes me so much more distant ? " 
Rose asked, twirling her parasol. 

Tony, whose plea had been quite extempo- 
rised, felt a slight confusion, which his laugh 

186 



186 THB OTHXB HOUSB 

but inadequately coyered. ^I seem to haye 
uttered a bttise — but I haven't. I only mean 
that a different title belongs, somehow, to a 
different character." 

**I don't admit my character to be different," 
Rose said; ^^save perhaps in the sense of its 
haying become a little intensified. If I was 
here before as Julia's friend, I'm here still more 
as Julia's friend now.'* 

Tony meditated, with all his candour; then 
he gaye a highly cordial, eyen if a slightly 
illogical assent. **0f course you are — from 
your own point of view." He eyidently only 
wanted to meet her as &r on the way to a 
quiet life as he could manage. ^^Dear little 
Julia I" he exclaimed in a manner which, as 
soon as he had spoken, he felt to be such a 
fresh piece of pointlessness that, to catiy it off, 
he got up again. 

^^Dear little Julia!" Rose echoed, speaking 
out loud and clear, but with an expression 
which, unlike Tony's, would have left on the 
mind of an ignorant auditor no doubt of its 
conyeying a reference to the unforgotten dead. 

Tony strolled towards the hammock. **May 
I smoke a cigarette?" She approved with a 



THB OTHEB HOUBB 187 

gestxire that was almost impatient, and while 
he lighted he pursued with friendly gaiety: 
^I'm not going to allow you to pretend that 
you doubt of my having dreamed for years of 
the pleasure of seeing you here again, or of the 
diabolical ingenuity that I exercised to enable 
your visit to take place in the way most con- 
venient to both of us. You used to say the 
Queen-mother disliked you. Tou see to-day 
how much!'* 

^*She has ended by finding me useful," said 
Rose. ^That brings me exactly to what I told 
you just now I wanted to say to you." 

Tony had gathered the loose net of the 
hammock into a single strand and, while he 
smoked, had lowered himself upon it, sideways, 
in a posture which made him sit as in a swing. 
He looked surprised and even slightly discon- 
certed, like a man asked to pay twice. **0h, 
it isn't then what you did say ?" 

*^ About your use of my name? No, it isn't 
that — it's something quite different." Rose 
waited; she stood before him as she had stood 
before her previous interlocutor. **It's to let 
you know the interest I take in Paul Beever. 
I take the veiy greatest." 



188 THB OTHSB H0U8B 

"You do?" said Tony, approvingly. "Well, 
you might go in for something worse I " 

He spoke with a cheerfulness that covered 
all the ground ; but she repeated the words as if 
challenging their sense. "I might *go in' ?" 

Her accent struck a light from them, put in 
an idea that had not been Tony's own. Thus 
presented, the idea seemed happy, and, in his 
incontrollable restlessness, his face more vividly 
brightening, he rose to it with a zeal that 
brought him for a third time to his feet. He 
smiled ever so kindly, and before he could 
measure his words or his manner, broke out: 
"If you only really would^ you know, my dear 
Rosel" 

In a quicker flash he became aware that, as 
if he had dealt her a blow in the face, her eyes 
had filled with tears. It made the taste of his 
joke too bad. "Are you gracefully suggesting 
that I shall carry Mr. Beever off?" she de- 
manded. 

"Not from m«, my dear — never I" Tony 
blushed and felt how much there was to rectify 
in some of his impulses. " I think a lot of him 
and I want to keep my hand on him. But I 
speak of him frankly, always, as a prize, and 



THE OTHEB H0X7BB 188 

I want something awfully good to happen to 
him. If ifou like him/' he hastened laughingly 
to add, ^^ of coarse it does happen — I see I " 

He attenuated his meaning, but he had already 
exposed it, and he could perceive that Rose, with 
a kind of tragic perversity, was determined to 
get the full benefit, whatever it might be, of her 
impression of her grievance. She quickly did 
her best to look collected. **Tou think he's 
safe then, and solid, and not so stupid as he 
strikes one at first?" 

^^ Stupid? — not a bit. He's a statue in the 
block — he's a sort of slumbering giant The 
right sort of tact will call him to life, the right 
sort of hand will work him out of the stone." 

^^And it escaped you just now, in a moment 
of unusual expansion, that the right sort are 
mine?" 

Tony puffed away at his cigarette, smiling at 
her resolutely through its light smoke. **Tou 
do injustice to my attitude about you. There 
isn't an hour of the day that I don't indulge in 
some tribute or other to your great ability." 

Again there came into the girl's face her 
strange alternative look — the look of being 
made by her passion so acquainted with pain 



IM THB OTHEB HOUBE 

that even in the midst of it she could flower 
into charity. Sadly and gently she shook her 
head. *^ Poor Tony I " Then she added in quite 
a different tone: **What do you think of the 
difference of our ages?'* 

*^ Tours and Paul's? It isn't worth speaking 
of I" 

*^ That's sweet of you< — considering that he's 
only twenty-two* However, I'm not yet thirty," 
she went on ; ^* and, of course, to gain time, one 
might press the thing hard." She hesitated 
again; after which she continued: ^^It's awfully 
vulgar, this way, to put the dots on the tX but 
as it was you, and not I, who began it, I may ask 
if you really believe that if one $hould make a bit 

of an effort ?" And she invitingly paused, 

to leave him to complete a question as to which 
it was natural she should feel a delicacy. 

Tony's face, for an initiated observer, would 
have shown that he was by this time watching 
for a trap; but it would also have shown that, 
after a moment's further reflection, he didn't 
particularly care if the trap should catch him. 
^If you take such an interest in Paul," he re- 
plied, with no visible abatement of his preference 
for the standpoint of pleasantry, ^^you can cal- 



 191 

culate better than I the natural results of draw- 
ing him out. But what I can assure you is that 
nothing would give me greater pleasure than to 
see you so happily ^established,* as they say — so 
honourably married, so affectionately surrounded, 
and so thoroughly protected." 

^^ And all alongside of you, here ? " cried Rose. 

Tony faltered, but he went on. ^* It*s precisely 
your being * alongside ' of one that would enable 
one to see you." 

^^It would enable one to see you — it would 
have that particular merit," said Rose. ** But my 
interest in Mr. Beever hasn't at all been of a 
kind to prompt me to turn the possibility over 
for myself. Tou can readily imagine how far I 
should have been in that case from speaking of 
it to you. The defect of your charming picture," 
she presently added, ^* is that an important figure 
is absent from it." 

"An important figure?" 

"Jean Martle." 

Tony looked at the tip of his cigarette. " You 
mean because there was at one time so much 
planning and plotting oyer the idea that she 
should make a match with Paul?" 

"At one time, my dear Tony?" Rose ex- 



192 THB OTHBB H0U8B 

claimed. ^ There*s exactly as much as eyer, and 
Fm already — in these mere three weeks — in 
the very thick of it I Did you think the ques- 
tion had been quite dropped?*' she inquired. 

Tony faced her serenely enough — in part be* 
cause he felt the extreme importance of so doing. 
**I simply haven't heard much about it. Mrs. 
Beever used to talk about it. But she hasn't 
talked of late." 

^ She talked, my dear man, no more than half 
an hour ago I" Rose replied. 

Tony winced; but he stood bravely up; his 
cigarettes were an extreme resource. ^Really? 
And what did she say to you?" 

**She said nothing to me — but she said every- 
thing to her son. She said to him, I mean, that 
she'll never forgive him if she doesn't hear from 
him an hour or two hence that he has at last 
successfully availed himself, with Miss Martle, 
of this auspicious day, as well as of the fact that 
he*s giving her, in honour of it, something re- 
markably beautiful." 

Tony listened with marked attention, but with- 
out meeting his companion's eyes. He had again 
seated himself in the hammock, with his feet on 
the ground and his head thrown back; and he 



THB OTHBB HOUSB 198 

smoked freely, holding it with either hand. 
^^What is he giving her?'' he asked after a 
moment. 

Rose turned away ; she mechanically did some- 
thing at the table. ** Shouldn't you think she'd 
show it to you?" she threw over her shoulder. 

While this shoulder, sensibly cold for the 
instant, was presented he watched her. *^ I dare- 
say — if she accepts it." 

The girl faced him again. ^^And won't she 
accept it?" 

**Only — I should say — if she accepts Aim." 

''And won't she do that?" 

Tony made a ^ ring " with his cigarette. '' The 
thing will be for him to get her to." 

''That's exactly," said Rose, "what I want 
you to do." 

" Me ? " He now stared at her. " How can I ? " 

" I won't undertake to tell you how — I'll leave 
that to your ingenuity. Wouldn't it be a matter 
— just an easy extension — of existing relations? 
Tou saw just now that he appealed to her for 
his chance, and that she consented to give it to 
him. What I wanted you to hear from me is 
that I feel how much interested you'll be in 
learning that this chance is of the highest im- 



194 THB OTHBB HOUSB 

portance for him, and that I know with how 
good a conscience you'll throw your weight into 
the scale of his success." 

** My weight with the young lady? Don*t you 
rather exaggerate my weight?'* Tony asked. 

** That question can only be answered by your 
trying it. It's a situation in which not to take 
an interest is — well, not your duty, you know/' 
said Rose. 

Tony gave a smile which he felt to be a little 
pale ; but there was still good-humour in the tone 
in which he protestingly and portentously mur- 
mured: "Oh, my *duty' 1" 

"Surely; if you see no objection to poor Mrs. 
Beever's at last gathering the fruit of the tree 
she long ago so fondly and so carefully planted. 
Of course, if you should frankly tell me you see 
one that I don't know 1" She looked in- 
genuous and hard. " Do you, by chance, see one ?" 

"None at all. I've never known a tree of 
Ifrs. Beever's of which the fruit hasn't been 
sweet" 

"Well, in the present case — sweet or bitter I 
— it's ready to fall. This is the hour the years 
have pointed to. You think highly of Paul " 

Tony Bream took hor up. "And I think 



THB OTHBB HOITSB 195 

highly of Jean, and therefore I must see them 
through ? I catch your meaning. But have yon 
— in a matter composed, after all, of ticklish ele- 
ments — thought of the danger of one's med- 
dling?*' 

^^A great deal.'* A troubled Tision of this 
danger dawned even now in Rose's face. ^*But 
I've thought still more of one's possible prudence 
— one's occasional tact" Tony, for a moment, 
made no reply; he quitted the hammock and 
began to stroll about. Her anxious eyes fol- 
lowed him, and presently she brought out: 
^^Have you really been supposing that they've 
given it up?" 

Tony remained silent; but at last he stopped 
short, and there was an effect of returning from 
an absence in the way he abruptly demanded: 
"That who have given up what?" 

"That Mrs. Beever and Paul have given up 
what we're talking about — the idea of his union 
with Jean." 

Tony hesitated. "I haven't been supposing 
anything at all I" Rose recognised the words 
for the first he had ever uttered to her that ex- 
pressed even a shade of irritation, and she was 
unable to conceal that she felt, on the spot, how 



196 THB OTHBB HOU8B 

memorable this fact was to make them. Todj^b 
immediate glance at her showed equally that he 
had instantly become aware of their so affecting 
her. He did, however, nothing to modify the im- 
pression : he only stood a moment looking across 
the river ; after which he observed quietly : ^ Here 
she is — on the bridge." 

He had walked nearer to the stream, and Rose 
had moved back to the tea-table, from which 
the view of the bridge was obstructed. ^^Has 
she brought the child?" she asked. 

**I don't make out — she may have her by the 
hand." He approached again, and as he came 
he said: *^Tour idea is really that I should 
speak to her now?" 

^Before she sees Paul?'* Rose met his eyes; 
there was a quick anguish of uncertainty in all 
her person. **I leave that to you — since you 
cast a doubt on the safety of your doing so. I 
leave it," said Rose, *^ to your judgment — I leave 
it to your honour." 

^To my honour?" Tony wondered with a 
showy jerk of his head what the deuce his hon* 
our had to do with it. 

She went on without heeding him. ** My idea 
is only that, whether you speak to her or not. 



THB OTHSB HOUSA 197 

she shall accept him. Gracious heavens, she 
mu8t!^^ Rose broke out with passion. 

**You take an immense interest in it I" Tony 
laughed. 

** Take the same, then, yourself, and the thing 
will come off.'' They stood a minute looking 
at each other, and more passed between them 
than had ever passed before. The result of it 
was that Rose had a drop from her strenuous 
height to sudden and beautiful gentleness. 
"Tony Bream, I trust you." 

She had uttered the word in a way that had 
the power to make him flush. He answered 
peaceably, however, laughing again: "I hope so, 
my dear Rose!" Then in a moment he added: 
"I mil speak." He glanced again at the cir- 
cuitous path from the bridge, but Jean had not 
yet emerged from the shrubbery by which it was 
screened. " If she brings Effie, will you take her? " 

With her ominous face the girl considered. 
"I'm afraid I can't do that." 

Tony gave a gesture of impatience. " Oood God, 
how you stand off from the poor little thing I " 

Jean at this moment came into sight without 
the child. "I shall never take her from her!** 
And Rose Armiger turned away. 



Tony went toward his messenger, who, as she 
saw Rose apparently leaving the garden, press- 
inglj called out: ^^ Would ycm, Miss Armiger, 
very kindly go over for Effie ? She wasn't even 
yet ready,** she explained as she came back up 
the slope with her friend, ^^and I was afraid to 
wait after promising Paul to meet him/* 

**He*s not here, you see,** said Tony; **it's he 
who, most ungallantly, makes you wait. Never 
mind ; you'll wait with me." He looked at Rose 
as they overtook her. ^^ Will you go and bring 
the child, as our friend here asks, or is such an 
act as that also, and still more, inconsistent with 
your mysterious principles?*' 

*^Tou must kindly excuse me," Rose said di- 
rectly to Jean. **I*ve a letter to write in the 
house. Now or never — I must catch the post" 

** Don*t let us keep you, then,*' Tony returned. 
^ I'll go over myself — as soon as Paul comes back," 

198 



THE OTHSB HOUSE 199 

**I11 send him straight out." And Rose Ar- 
miger retired in good order. 

Tony followed her with his eyes; then he ex- 
claimed: ^It's, upon my soul, as if she couldn't 

trust herself 1 " His remark, which he 

checked, dropped into a snap of his fingers 
while Jean Martle wondered. 

"To do what?" she asked. 

Tony hesitated. «' To do nothing I The child's 
all right?" 

"Perfectly right. It's only that the great 
Gorham has decreed that she's to have her usual 
little supper before she comes, and that, with 
her ribbons and frills all covered with an enor- 
mous bib, Effie had just settled down to that 
extremely solemn function." 

Tony, in Ws turn, wondered. " Why shouldn't 
she have her supper here?" 

"Ah, you must ask the great Gorham!" 

"And didn't y<m ask her?" 

"I did better — I divined her," said Jean. 
"She doesn't trust our kitchen." 

Tony laughed. " Does she apprehend poison ? " 

"She apprehends what she calls * sugar and 
spice.' " 

"*And all that's nice?' Well, there's too 



200 THE OTHER HOtJSS 

much that's nice here, certainly I Leave the poor 
child, then, like the little princess you all make 
of her, to her cook and her * taster,' to the full 
rigour of her royalty, and stroll with me here 
till Paul comes out to you." He looked at his 
watch and about at the broad garden where the 
shadows of the trees were still and the long 
afternoon had grown rich. **This is remarkably 
peaceful, and there's plenty of time." Jean con- 
curred with a murmur as soft as the stir of the 
breeze, a ** Plenty, plenty," as serene as if, to 
oblige Tony Bream, so charming a day would 
be sure to pause in its passage. They went a 
few steps, but he stopped again with a ques- 
tion. ^*Do you know what Paul wants of 
you?" 

Jean looked a moment at the grass by her feet. 
**I think I do." Then raising her eyes without 
shyness, but with unqualified gpcavity, **Do you 
know, Mr. Bream?" she asked. 

"Yes — I've just now heard." 

"From Miss Armiger?" 

"From Miss Armiger. She appears to have 
had it from Paul himself." 

The girl gave out her mild surprise. "Why 
has he told Aer/" 



THB OTHER H0X7BB 201 

Tony hesitated. ** Because she's such a good 
person to tell things to." 

^^ Is it her immediately telling them again that 
makes her so?" Jean inquired with a faint 
smile. 

Faint as this smile was, Tony met it as if he had 
been struck by it, and as if, indeed, in the midst 
of an acquaintance which four years had now 
consecrated, he had not quite got used to being 
struck. That acquaintance had practically begun, 
on an unforgettable day, with his opening his eyes 
on her from an effort which had been already 
then the effort to forget — his suddenly taking 
her in as he lay on the sofa in Us hall. From 
the way he sometimes looked at her it might 
have been judged that he had even now not taken 
her in completely — that the act of slow, charmed 
apprehension had yet to melt into accepted know- 
ledge. It had in truth been made continuous by 
the continuous expansion of its object. If the 
sense of lying there on the sofa still sometimes 
came back to Tony, it was because he was in- 
terested in not interrupting by a rash motion 
the process taking place in the figure before 
him, the capricious rotation by which the woman 
peeped out of the child and the child peeped 



202 THE OTHBB HOUSB 

out of the woman. There was no point at 
which it had begun, and none at which it would 
end, and it was a thing to gaze at with an at- 
tention refreshingly baffled. The frightened child 
had become a tall, slim nymph on a cloud, and 
yet there had been no moment of anything so 
gross as catching her in the act of change. If 
there had been, he would have met it with some 
punctual change of his own; whereas it was his 
luxurious idea — or had been up to now — that 
in the midst of the difference so delightfully am- 
biguous he was free just not to change, free to 
remain as he was and go on liking her on trivial 
grounds*. It had seemed to him that there was no 
one he had ever liked whom he could like quite 
so comfortably: a man of his age had had what 
he rather loosely called the *^ usual" flashes of 
fondness. There had been no worrying question 
of the light this particular flash might kindle; 
he had never had to ask himself what his appre- 
ciation of Jean Martle might lead to. It would 
lead to exactly nothing — that had been settled, 
all round, in advance. This was a happy, lively 
provision that kept everything down, made socia- 
bility a cool, public, out-of-door affair, without a 
secret or a mystery — confined it, as one might 



THE OTHBB HOUSB 203 

say, to the breezy, sunny forecourt of the tem- 
ple of friendship, forbidding it any dream of 
access to the obscure and comparatively stuffy 
interior. Tony had acutely remarked to him- 
self that a thing could be led to only when there 
was a practicable road. As present to him to- 
day as on that other day was the little hour of 
violence — so strange and sad and sweet — which, 
in his life, had effectually suppressed any thorough- 
fare, making this expanse so pathless that, had he 
not been looking for a philosophic rather than a 
satiric term, he might almost have compared it to 
a desert. He answered his companion's inquiry 
about Rose's responsibility as an informant after 
he had satisfied himself that if she smiled ex- 
actly as she did it was only another illustration 
of a perfect instinct. That instinct, which at 
any time turned all talk with her away from 
flatness, told her that the right attitude for her 
now was the middle course between anxiety and 
resignation. ^^If Miss Armiger hadn't spoken," 
he said, ^^I shouldn't have known. And of 
course I'm interested in knowing." 

** But why is she interested in your doing so ? " 
Jean asked. 

Tony walked on again. ^ She has several rea- 



204 THE OTHSB HOTTSB 

sons. One of them is that she gteatlj likes Paul, 
and that, greatly liking him, she wishes the high- 
est happiness conceivable for him. It occurred 
to her that as I greatly like a certain young 
lady, I might not unnaturally desire for that 
young lady a corresponding chance, and that 
with a hint," laughed Tony, ^Hhat she really is 
about to have it, I might perhaps see my way 
to putting in a word for the dear boy in ad- 
vance.** 

The girl strolled beside him, looking quietly 
before her. **How does she know,'* she de- 
manded, ^^whom you * greatly like*?" 

The question pulled him up a little, but he 
resisted the impulse, constantly strong in him, 
to stop again and stand face to face with her. 
He continued to laugh, and after an instant he 
replied : ^* Why, I suppose I must have told her. 

** And how many persons will she have told? 

**I don't care how many,*' Tony said, *^and I 
don*t think you need care either. Everyone but 
she — from lots of observation — knows we're good 
friends, and it's because that's such a pleasant old 
story with us all that I feel as if I might frankly 
say to you what I have on my mind. 

^* About what Paul may have to say? 



n 






THE OTHBB HOUSB 205 

*^The first moment you let him." 

Tony was going on when she broke in : ^ How 
long have you had it on your mind?" 

He found himself, at this inquiry, just a trifle 
embarrassed. "How long?" 

"As it's only since Miss Armiger has told you 
that you've known there's anything in the air." 

This inquiry gave Tony such pause that he 
met it first with a laugh and then with a counter- 
appeal. "You make me feel dreadfully dense I 
Do you mind my asking how long you yourself 
have known that what may be in the air's on 
the point of alighting?" 

"Why, since Paul spoke to me." 

"Just now — before you went to Bounds?" 
Tony wondered. "You were immediately sure 
that that's what he wants?" 

"What else can he want? He doesn't want 
so much," Jean added, "that there would have 
been many alternatives." 

" I don't know what you call ^ much ' ! " Again 
Tony wondered. "And it produces no more 
effect upon you " 

"Than I'm showing to you now?" the girl 
asked. "Do you think me dreadfully stolid?" 

"No, because I know that, in general, what 



206 THB OTHER HOUSB 

you show isn't at all the full measure of what 
you feel. You're a great little mystery. Stilly" 
Tony blandly continued, ** you strike me as calm 
for a young lady whose fate's about to be sealed. 
Unless, of course, you've regarded it," he added, 
^^as sealed from far away back." 

They had strolled, in the direction they had 
followed, as far as they could go, and they nec- 
essarily stopped for a turn. Without taking up 
his last words Jean stood there and looked ob- 
scurely happy, as it seemed to him, at his recog- 
nition of her haying appeared as quiet as she 
wished. ^^You haven't answered my question," 
she simply said. *^You haven't told me how 
long you've had it on your mind that you must 
say to me whatever it is you wish to say." 

**Why is it important I should answer it?" 

^^ Only because you seemed positively to imply 
that the time of your canying your idea about 
had been of the shortest. In the case of advice, 
if to advise is what you wish " 

**It %$ what I wish," Tony interrupted ; ^^strangely 
as it may strike you that, in regard to such a 
matter as we refer to, one should be eager for 
such a responsibility. The question of time 
doesn't signify — what signifies is one's sincerity. 



 207 

I had an impression, I confess, that the prospect 
I a good while ago supposed you to have accepted 
had — what shall I call it? — rather faded away. 
But at the same time I hoped" — and Tony 
invited his companion to resume their walk — 
^Hhat it would charmingly come up again." 

Jean moved beside him and spoke with a 
colourless kindness which suggested no desire to 
challenge or cross-question, but a thoughtful in- 
terest in anything, in the connection in which 
they were talking, that he would be so good as 
to tell her, and an earnest desire to be clear about 
it. Perhaps there was also in her manner just 
the visible tinge of a confidence that he would 
tell her the absolute truth. ^^ I see. Tou hoped 
it would charmingly come up again." 

**So that on learning that it is charmingly 
coming up, don't you see," Tony laughed, **I'm 
so agreeably agitated that I spill over on the 
spot I want without delay to be definite to 
you about the really immense opinion I have of 
dear Paul. It can't do any harm, and it may 
do a little good, to mention that it has always 
seemed to me that we've only got to give him 
time. I mean, of course, don't you know," he 
added, ^^for him quite to distinguish himself." 



208 THB OTHEB HOtJBB 

Jean was silent a little, as if she were thor- 
oughly taking this home. ^* Distinguish himself 
in what way?" she asked with all her tran- 
qoillity. 

"Well — in every way," Tony handsomely re- 
plied. " He's full of stuff — there's a great deal 
of him: too much to come out all at once. Of 
course you know him — you've known him half 
your life; but I see him in a strong and special 
light, a light in which he has scarcely been shown 
to you, and which puts him to a real test He 
has ability; he has ideas; he has absolute hon- 
esty; and he has moreover a good stiff back of 
his own. He's a fellow of head; he's a fellow 
of heart. In short he's a man of gold." 

**He's a man of gold," Jean repeated with 
punctual acceptance, yet as if it mattered much 
more that Tony should think so than that she 
should. "It would be odd," she went on, "to 
be talking with you on a subject so personal to 
myself, if it were not that I felt Paul's attitude 
for so long past to be rather publicly taken for 
granted. He has felt it so, too, I think, poor 
boy, and, for good or for ill, there has been in 
our situation very little mystery and perhaps 
not much modesty." 



THB OTHER HOUSB 209 

^^Why Mhould there be, of the false kind, 
when even the true has nothing to do with the 
matter? You and Paul are great people: he's 
the heir-apparent, and you're the most eligible 
princess in the Almanach de Gotha. You can't 
be there and be hiding behind the window- 
curtain: you must step out on the balcony to 
be seen of the populace* Your most private 
afiGEurs are affaira of state. At the smallest hint 
like the one I just mentioned, even an old dunder- 
head like me catches on — he sees the strong 
reasons for Paul's attitude. However, it's not 
of that, so much, that I wanted to say a word. 
I thought perhaps you'd just let me touch on 
your own." Tony hesitated; he felt vaguely 
disconcerted by the special quality of stillness 
that, though she moved beside him, her atten- 
tion, her expectation put forth. It came over 
him that for the purpose of his plea she was 
almost too prepared, and this made him speculate. 
He stopped short again, and, uneasily, *^May I 
light one more cigarette?" he asked. She ab- 
sented with a flicker in her dim smile, and while 
he lighted he was increasingly conscious that 
she waited. He met the deep gentleness of her 
eyes and reflected afresh that if she was always 



210 THB OTHSB HOUSE 

beautiful, she was beautiful at different times 
from different sources. What was the source of 
the impression she made on him at this moment 
if not a kind of refinement of patience in which 
she seemed actually to hold her breath? **In 
fact,*' he said as he threw awaj his match, *^I 
have touched on it — I mean on the great hope 
we all have that you do see your way to meeting 
our friend as he deserves." 

'«You 'all' have it?" Jean softly asked. 

Tony hesitated again. ''I'm sure I'm quite 
right in speaking for Wilverley at large. It 
takes the greatest interest in Paul, and I needn't, 
at this time of day, remind you of the interest 
it takes in yourself. But I repeat, what I meant 
more particularly to utter was my own special 
confidence in your decision. Now that I'm fully 
enlightened, it comes home to me that, as regards 
such a possibility as your taking your place here 
as a near neighbour and a permanent friend" — 
and Tony fixedly smiled — " why, I can only feel 
the liveliest suspense. I want to make thor- 
oughly sure of you I" 

Jean took this in as she had taken the rest; 
after which she simply said: "Then I think I 
ought to tell you that I shall not meet Paul in 



THE OTHSB HOUSE 211 

the way that what yoa*re so good as to say seems 
to point to.'' 

Tony had made many speeches, both in public 
and in private, and he had naturally been exposed 
to replies of the incisive no less than of the 
massive order. But no check of the current 
had ever made him throw back his head quite 
so far as this brief and placid announcement. 
"You'll not meet him ?" 

"I shall never marry him." 

He undisguisedly gasped. "In spite of all 
the reasons ?*' 

"Of course I've thought the reasons over — 
often and often. But there are reasons on the 
other side too. I shall never many him," she 
repeated. 



SoMBTHiNa strange occurred for Tony Bream 
as he listened to the words in which Jean Martle 
dispelled such obscurity as had hitherto attached 
to her position — something consisting of the fact 
that though half an hour before he had not felt 
the want of the assurance he had just asked of 
her, yet now that he saw it definitely withheld 
it took an importance as instantly as a mirror 
takes a reflection. This importance was so great 
that he found himself suddenly scared by what 
he heard. He thought an instant, with intensity. 
^'In spite of knowing that you'll disappoint'' — 
he paused a little — ''the universal hope?" 

** I know whom I shall disappoint ; but I must 
bear that. I shall disappoint Cousin Kate/' 

"Horribly," said Tony. 

"Horribly." 

" And poor Paul — to within an inch of his life." 

" No, not poor Paul, Mr. Bream ; not poor Paul 

2ia 



THE OTHBB HOUSB 218 

in the least,'* Jean said. She spoke without a 
hint of defiance or the faintest ring of brayado, 
as if for mere veracity and lucidity, since an 
opportunity quite unsought had been forced upon 
her. ^^I know about poor Paul. It's all right 
about poor Paul," she declared, smiling. 

She spoke and she looked at him with a sin- 
cerity so distilled, as he felt, from something 
deep within her, that to pretend to gainsay her 
would be in the worst taste. He turned about, 
not very brilliantly, as he was aware, to some 
other resource. ^* You'll immensely disappoint 
your own people." 

^^ Yes, my mother and my grandmother — they 
both would like it. But they've never had any 
promise from me." 

Tony was silent awhile. ^^ And Mrs. Bee ver — 
hasn't «Ae had?" 

**A promise? Never. I've known how much 
she has wanted it. But that's all." 

''Ah, that's a great deal," said Tony. ''If, 
knowing how much she has wanted it, you've 
oome back again and again, hasn't that been 
tantamount to giving it?" 

Jean considered. "I shall never come back 
again." 



214 THE OTHBB HOU8B 

^* Ah, my dear child, what a way to treat ua I ** 
her friend broke out* 

She took no notice of this ; she only went on : 
*^ Months ago — the last time I was here — an 
assurance, of a kind, was asked of me. Bat even 
then I held off.'' 

^^And you've gone on with that intention?" 

He had grown so serious now that he cross- 
questioned her, but she met him with a prompti- 
tude that was touching in its indulgence. *^ I've 
gone on without an intention. IVe only waited 
to see, to feel, to judge. The great thing seemed 
to me to be sure I wasn't un&ir to PauL I 
haven't been — I'm not unfEur. He'll never say 
I've been — I'm sure he won't. I should have 
liked to be able to become his wife. But I 
can't." 

^^ You've nevertheless excited hopes," said Tony. 
*^ Don't you think you ought to consider that a 
little more?" His uneasiness, his sense of the 
unexpected, as sharp as a physical pang, increased 
so that he began to lose sight of the importance 
of concealing it; and he went on even while 
something came into her eyes that showed he 
had not concealed it. ^^If you haven't meant 
not to do it, you've, so far as that goes, meant 



THB OTHBB HOUBX 216 

the opposite. Therefore something has made you 
change/' 

Jean hesitated. ^^Eveiything has made me 
change." 

^^Well/' said Tony, with a smile so strained 
that he felt it to be almost pitiful, *^ we've spoken 
of the disappointment to others, but I suppose 
there's no use in my attempting to say anything 
of the disappointment to me. That's not the thing 
that, in such a case, can have much effect on you." 

Again Jean hesitated ; he saw how pale she had 
grown. ^'Do I understand you tell me that you 
really desire my marriage?" 

If the revelation of how he desired it had not 
already come to him, the deep mystery of her 
beauty at this crisis might have brought it on 
the spot — a spectacle in which he so lost him- 
self for the minute that he found no words to 
answer till she spoke again. ^*Do I understand 
that you literally aek me for it?" 

^I ask you for it — I ask you for it," said 
Tony Bream. 

They stood looking at each other like a pair 
who, walking on a frozen lake, suddenly have 
in their ears the great crack of the ice. ^*And 
what are your reasons?" 



216 THB OIHBB HOUSB 

^m tell yoa my reasons when yoa tell me 
yoois for haying changed.*' 

^IVe not changed,** said Jean. 

It was as if their eyes were indissolnUy en- 
gaged. That was the way he had been looking, 
a while before, into another wonian*s, bat he 
could think at this moment how exquisitely 
different Jean*s were from those. He shook his 
head sadly and with all the tenderness he felt 
he might permit himself to show just this once 
and never again. ^Tou*ye changed — youVe 
changed.** 

Then she gave up. ^Wouldn't you much 
rather I should never come back?** 

^^Far rather. But you wUl come back,** said 
Tony. 

She looked away from him at last — she turned 
her eyes over the place in which she had known 
none but emotions permitted and avowed, and 
again she seemed to yield to the formidable 
truth. ^So you think I had better come back 
—different?** 

His tenderness broke out into a smile. **As 
different as possible. Aa different as that will 
be aa the difference,** he added. 

She appeared, with her averted face, to con- 



THE OTHBB HOI78E 217 

sider intently how much it might in such a case 
amount to. But '^ Here he comes," was what she 
presently replied. 

Paul Beever was in sight, so freshly dressed 
that even at a distance his estimate of the r^ 
quirements of the occasion was visible from his 
necktie to his boots. Adorned as it unmis- 
takably had never been, his great featureless 
person moved solemnly over the lawn. 

** Take him, then — take him I " said Tony 
Bream. 

Jean, intensely serious, but with agitation held 
at bay, gave him one more look, a look so in- 
finitely pacific that as, at Paul's nearer approach, 
he turned away from her, he had the sense of 
going off with a sign of her acceptance of his 
solution. The light in her face was the light of 
the compassion that had come out to him, and 
what was that compassion but the gage of a relief, 
of a promise? It made him walk down to the 
river with a step quickened to exhilaration; all 
the more that as the girl's eyes followed him 
he couldn't see in them the tragic intelligence 
he had kindled, her perception — from the very 
rhythm of the easy gait she had watched so often 
— that he really thought such a virtual confession 



218 THE OTHBB HOUBB 

to her would be none too layishly repaid by the 
effort for which he had appealed. 

Paul Beever had in his hand his little morocco 
case, but his glance also rested, till it disappeared, 
on Tony's straight and swinging back. **IVe 
driven him away," he said. 

**It was time,** Jean replied. ^Effie, who 
wasn't ready for me, must really come at last." 
Then, without the least pretence of unconscious- 
ness, she looked straight at the small object Paul 
carried. 

Observing her attention to it he also dropped 
his eyes on it, while his hands turned it round 
and round in apparent uncertainty as to whether 
he had better present it to her open or shut. ** I 
hope you won't be as indifferent as Effie seems 
to be to the pretty trifle with which I've thought 
I should like to commemorate your birthday." 
He decided to open the case, and with its lifted 
lid he held it out to her. ^It will give me 
great pleasure if you'll kindly accept this little 
ornament." 

Jean took it from him — she seemed to study 
it a minute. ^ Oh, Paul, oh, Paul I " — her protest 
was as sparing as a caress with the back of the 
hand. 



THB OTHER HOUSB 219 

^I ihonght you might care for the stone," he 



^ It's a rare and perfect one — it's magnificent." 

"Well, Miss Armiger told me you would 
know." There was a hint of relaxed suspense 
in Paul's tone. 

Still holding the case open, his companion 
looked at him a moment. "Did she kindly 
select it?" 

He stammered, colouring a little. " No ; mother 
and I did. We went up to London for it; we 
had the mounting designed and worked out. 
They took two months. But I showed it to Miss 
Armiger, and she said you'd spot any defect." 

" Do you mean," the girl asked, smiling, " that 
if you had not had her word for that, you would 
have tried me with something inferior? " 

Paul continued very grave. "Tou know well 
enough what I mean." 

Without again noticing the contents of the 
case she softly closed it and kept it in her 
hand. "Tes, Paul, I know well enough what 
you mean." She looked round her; then, as if 
her old familiarity with him were refreshed and 
sweetened : " Come and sit down with me." She 
led the way to a garden bench that stood at a 



220 THE OTHEB HOUSB 

distance from Mrs. Beever's tea-table, an old 
green wooden bench that was a perennial feat- 
ure of the spot. ^^If Miss Armiger knows that 
I'm a judge," she pursued as they went, ^it's 
because, I think, she knows everything — every^ 
thing except one, which I know better than 
she." She seated herself, glancing up and put- 
ting out her free hand to him with an air of 
comradeship and trust. Paul let it take his own, 
which it held there a minute. **I know you." 
She drew him down, and he dropped her hand; 
whereupon it returned to his little box, which, 
with the aid of the other, it tightly and nei^ 
Yously clasped. " I can't take your present. It's 
impossible," she said. 

He sat leaning forward with his big red fists 
on his knees. ^^Not for your birthday?" 

**It's too splendid for that — it's too precious. 
And how can I take it for that when it isn't for 
that you offer it? How can I take so much, 
Paul, when I give you so little? It represents 
so much more than itself — a thousand more 
things than I've any right to let you think I 
can accept. I can't pretend not to know — I 
must meet you half-way. I want to do that 
so much — to keep our relations happy, happy

always, without a break or a cloud. They will 
be — they'll be beautiful. WeVe only to be 
frank. They are now: I feel it in the kind 
way you listen to me. If you hadn't asked to 
speak to me, I should have asked it myself. Six 
months ago I promised I would tell you, and I've 
known the time was come.'* 

*^ The time is come, but don't tell me till you've 
given me a chance," said Paul. He had listened 
without looking at her, his little eyes pricking 
with their intensity the remotest object they could 
reach. **I want so to please you — to make you 
take a favourable view. There isn't a condition 
you may make, you know, of any sort whatever, 
that I won't grant you in advance. And if 
there's any inducement you can name that I've 
the least capacity to offer, please regard it as 
offered with all my heart. Ton know every- 
thing — you understand; but just let me repeat 
that all I am, all I have, all I can ever be or 
do " 

She laid her hand on his arm as if to help, not 
to stop him. "Paul, Paul — you're beautiful!" 
She brushed him with the feather of her tact, 
but he reddened and continued to avert his big 
face, as if he were aware that the moment of such 



222 THE OTHBK H0U8B 

an assertion was scarcely the moment to ventare 
to show it. ^Tou^re such a gentleman!** Jean 
went on — this time with a tremor in her yoice 
that made him turn. 

*^ That's the sort of fine thing I wanted to say 
to you^^ he said. And he was so accustomed, in 
any talk, to see his interlocutor suddenly laugh, 
that his look of benevolence covered even her air 
of being amused by these words. 

She smiled at him; she patted his arm* 
^^YouVe said to me far more than that comes 
to. I want you — oh, I want you so to be suc- 
cessful and happy!" And her laugh, with an 
ambiguous sob, suddenly changed into a burst 
of tears. 

She recovered herself, but she had brought 
tears into his own eyes. *^0h, that's of no 
consequence! Fm to understand that you'll 
never, never ?" 

"Never, never.'* 

Paul drew a long, low breath. ** Do you know 
that everyone has thought you probably would?** 

^ Certainly, I've known it, and that's why I'm 
glad of our talk. It ought to have come sooner. 
Tou thought I probably would, I think 

'' Oh, yes ! " Paul artlessly broke in. 



 228 

Jean laughed again while she wiped her eyes. 
^^ That's why I call you beautiful. Tou had my 
possible expectation to meet." 

*'0h, yes!" he said again. 

'^And you were to meet it like a gentleman. 
I might have — but no matter. Tou risked your 
life — you've been magnificent." Jean got up. 
*^And now, to make it perfect, you must take 
this back." 

She put the morocco case into his submissive 
hand, and he sat staring at it and mechanically 
turning it round. Unconsciously, musingly, he 
threw it a little way into the air and caught it 
again. Then he also got up. ** They'll be tre- 
mendously down on us." 

"On •us'? On me, of course — but why on 
you?" 

"For not having moved you." 

"You've moved me immensely. Before me — 
let no one say a word about you I" 

" It's of no consequence," Paul repeated. 

"Nothing is, if we go on as we are. We're 
better friends than ever. And we're happy!" 
Jean announced in her triumph. 

He looked at her with deep wistfulness, with 
patient envy. " Tou are I " Then his eyes took 



224 THB OTHEB HOUSE 

the direction to whioh her attention at that 
moment passed: they showed him Tony Bream 
coming up the slope with his littie girl in his 
hand. Jean went down instantly to welcome 
the child, and Paul turned away with a grave 
face, giving at the same time another impulsive 
toss to the case containing the token she had 
declined. 



Hb directed his face to the house, however, 
only to find himself in the presence of his 
mother, who had come back to her tea-table 
and whom he saw veritably glare at the small 
object in his hands. From this object her scru- 
tiny jumped to his own countenance, which, to 
his great discomfort, was not conscious of very 
successfully bafiUng it. He knew therefore a 
momentary relief when her observation attached 
itself to Jean Martle, whom Tony, planted on 
the lawn, was also undisguisedly watching, and 
who was already introducing Effie to the treasure 
laid up in the shade of the tea-table. The girl 
had caught up the child on her strong young 
arm, where she sat robust and radiant, befrilled 
and besashed, hugging the biggest of the dolls; 
and in this position — erect, active, laughing, her 
rosy burden, almost on her shoulder, mingling its 

brightness with that of her crown of hair, and her

other hand grasping, for Effie's further delight, in 
the form of another puppet from the pile, a still 
rosier imitation of it — anticipated quickly the 
challenge which, as Paul saw, Mrs. Beever was 
on the point of addressing her. 

^*Our wonderful cake's not coming out?** 

**It's too big to transport," said Mrs. Beever: 
^iVb blazing away in the dining-room." 

Jean Martle turned to Tony. ^^I may carry 
her in to see it?" 

Tony assented. ^*Only please remember she's 
not to partake." 

Jean smiled at him. ^^IH eat her share I" 
And she passed swiftly over the lawn while the 
three pairs of eyes followed her. 

'«She looks," said Tony, ""like the goddess 
Diana playing with a baby-nymph." 

Mrs. Beever's attention came back to her son. 
*^ That's the sort of remark one would expect to 
hear from jftm! You're not going with her? 

Paul showed vacant and vast. *^ I'm going in. 

"To the dining-room?" 

He wavered. "To speak to Miss Armiger." 

His mother's gaze, sharpened and scared, had 
reverted to his morocco case. "To ask her to 
keep that again?"

THB OTHEB HOUSE 227 

At this Paul met her with spirit. **She may 
keep it for ever I" Giving another toss to his 
missile, while his companions stared at each 
other, he took the same direction as Jean. 

Mrs. Beever, disconcerted and flushed, broke 
out on the spot to Tony. ^ Heaven help us all — 
she has refused him I** 

Tony's &ce reflected her alarm. **Pray, how 
do you know?" 

*^ By his having his present to her left on his 
hands — a jewel a girl would jump at! I came 
back to hear it was settled '* 

** And you haven't heard it*s not I *' Tony anx- 
iously broke in. 

''What I haven't heard I've seen. That it's 
' not ' sticks out of them I If she won't accept the 
gift," Mrs. Beever cried, '' how can she accept the 
giver?" 

Tony's appearance, for some seconds, was an 
echo of her question. ''Why, she just promised 
me she would!" 

This only deepened his neighbour's surprise. 
"Promised jfou ?" 

Tony hesitated. " I mean she left me to infer 
that I had determined her. She was so good as 
to listen most appreciatively to what I had to say." 



228  

'^And, pray, what had you to say?" Mrs. 
Beever asked with austerity. 

In the presence of a rigour so immediate he 
found himself so embarrassed that he considered. 
"Well — everything. I took the liberty of urg- 
ing Paul's claim." 

Mrs. Beever stared. **Very good of you I 
What did you think you had to do with it?" 

"Why, whatever my great desire that she 
should accept him gave me." 

" Tour great desire that she should accept him? 
This is the first Tve heard of it." 

Once more Tony pondered. "Did I never 
speak of it to you?" 

" Never that I can remember. From when does 
it date?" Mrs. Beever demanded. 

"From the moment I really understood how 
much Paul had to hope." 

"How «much'?" the lady of Eastmead deri- 
sively repeated. "It wasn't so much that you 
need have been at such pains to make it less I" 

Tony's comprehension of his friend's discomfit- 
ure was written in the smile of determined good- 
humour with which he met the asperity of her 
successive inquiries ; but his own uneasiness, 
which was not the best thing in the world for 



THE OTHfifi HOUSB 229 

bis temper, showed through this superficial glitter. 
He looked suddenly as blank as a man can look 
who looks annoyed. ** How in the world could I 
have supposed I was making it less?'* 

Mrs. Beever faltered in her turn. **To answer 
that question I should need to have been present 
at your appeal.'' 

Tony's eyes put forth a fire. ^* It seems to me 
that your answer, as it is, will do very well for a 
charge of disloyalty. Do you imply that I didn't 
act in good faith?" 

^ Not even in my sore disappointment. But I 
imply that you made a gross mistake." 

Tony lifted his shoulders ; with his hands in his 
pockets he had begun to fidget about the lawn — 
bringing back to her as he did so the worried fig- 
ure that, in the same attitude, the day of poor 
Julia's death, she had seen pace the hall at the 
other house. ^* But what the deuce then was I to 
do?" 

"You were to let her alone." 

*^ Ah, but I should have had to begin that ear- 
lier I " he exclaimed with ingenuous promptitude. 

Mrs. Beever gave a laugh of despair. " Years 
and years earlier?" 

" I mean," returned Tony with a blush, ** that 



280  

from the first of her heing here I made a point of 
giving her the impression of all the good I thought 
of Paul." 

His hostess continued sarcastic. **If it was a 
question of making points and giving impressions, 
perhaps then you should have hegun later still I ** 
She gathered herself a moment; then she brought 
out: ^^You should have let her alone, Tony 
Bream, because you're madly in love with her I ** 

Tony dropped into the nearest chair; he sat 
there looking up at the Queen-mother. **Tour 
proof of that's my plea for your son?'* 

She took full in the face his air of pity for her 
lapse. ^^Tour plea was not for my son — your 
plea was for your own danger." 

««My own ^danger'?" — Tony leaped to his 
feet again in illustration of his security. ^ Need 
I inform you at this time of day that I've such 
a thing as a conscience?" 

**Far from it, my dear man. Exactly what I 
complain of is that you've quite too much of one." 
And she gave him, before turning away, what 
might have been her last look and her last word. 
** Tour conscience is as big as your passion, and if 
both had been smaller, you might perhaps have 
held your tongue I " 



 281 

She moYed off in a manner that added emphasis 
to her words, and Tony watched her with his 
hands still in his pockets and his long legs a little 
apart He could turn it over that she accused 
him, after all, only of haying been a particularly 
injurious fool. ** I was under the same impression 
as you," he said — *Hhat Paul was safe." 

This arrested and brought her sharply round. 
**And were you under the impression that Jean 
was?" 

^On my honour — as far as JTm concerned!" 

** It's of course of you we*re talking," Mrs. Bee- 
Ter replied. ^ If you weren't her motive, are you 
able to suggest who was?" 

^ Her motive for refusing Paul ? " Tony looked 
at the sky for inspiration. ^^Fm afraid I'm too 
surprised and distressed to have a theory." 

*^Have you one by chance as to why, if you 
thought them both so safe, you interfered?" 

^ * Interfered ' is a hard word," said Tony. *^ I 
felt a wish to testify to my great sympathy with 
Paul from the moment I heard — what I didn't at 
all know — that this was the occasion on which 
he was, in more senses than one, to present his 



case." 



^ May I go so far as to ask," said Mrs. Beever, 



n 



232 THB OTHEB HOUSB 

** if yoar sadden revelation proceeded from Paul 
himself?" 

**No — not from Paul himself." 

*^And scarcely from Jean, I suppose. 

*^Not in the remotest degree from Jean. 

" Thank you," she replied — " you've told me." 
She had taken her place in a chair and fixed her 
eyes on the ground. *' IVe something to tell you 
myself, though it may not interest you so much." 
Then raising her eyes : *^ Dennis Vidal is here." 

Tony almost jumped. **In the house?" 

** On the river — paddling about." After which, 
as his blankness grew, ^^He turned up an hour 
ago," she explained. 

**And no one has seen him?" 

''The Doctor and Paul. But Paul didn't 
know " 

''And didn't ask?" Tony panted. 

" What does Paul ever ask ? He's too stupid I 
Besides, with all my affairs, he sees my people 
come and go. Mr. Vidal vanished when he heard 
that Miss Armiger's here." 

Tony went from surprise to mystification. 
"Noti to come back?" 

"On the contrary, I hope — as he took my 
boat"

^Bat he wishes not to see her?** 

*« He*s thinking it over.** 

Tony wondered. ^What then did he oome 
for?'* 

Mrs. Beever hong fire. **He came to see 
Effie.** 

"Effie?** 

»'To jndge if you're likely to lose her.** 

Tony threw hack his head. ^How the devil 
does that concern himf^* 

Again Mis. Beever faltered; then as she rose, 
«« Hadn't I better leave yon to think it out?** she 
demanded. 

Tony, in spite of his bewildered face, thought 
it out with such effect that in a moment he ex- 
claimed: **Then he still wants that girl?'* 

** Very much indeed. That's why he's afraid '* 

Tony took her up. ''That Effie may die?" 

** It's a hideous thing to be talking about,*' said 
Mrs. Beever. ^ But you*ve perhaps not forgotten 
who were present " 

''Fve not forgotten who were present I Fm 
greatly honoured by Mr. Vidal's solicitude," 
Tony continued; ''but I beg you to tell him 
from me that I think I can take care of my 
child."

At the sight of the two penons in the garden 
Rose came straight down to them, and Mrs. Beever, 
sombre and sharp, still seeking relief in the oppor- 
tunity for satire, remarked to her companion, in a 
manner at once ominous and indifferent, that her 
guest was evidently in eager pursuit of him. Tony 
replied with gaiety that he awaited her with forti- 
tude, and Rose, reaching them, let him know that, 
as she had something more to say to him, she was 
glad he had not, as she feared, quitted the garden. 
Mrs. Beever hereupon signified her own intention 
of taking this course: she would leave their vis- 
itor, as she said, to Rose to deal with. 

Rose smiled with her best grace. '* That's as I 
leave Paul to you. Tve just been with him." 

Mrs. Beever testified not only to interest but to 
approval. " In the library ? '* 

^In the drawing-room.*' Rose, the next mo- 
ment, conscientiously showed by a further remark 

S86 



236 THE OTHElt HOUSE 

her appreciation of the attitude that, on the part 
of her hostess, she had succeeded in producing. 
** Miss Martlets in the library." 

'' And Effie ? '* Mrs. Beever asked. 

** Effie, of course, is where Miss Martle is.*^ 

Tony, during this brief colloquy, had lounged 
away as restlessly as if, instead of beaming on the 
lady of Eastmead, Rose were watching the master 
of the other house. He promptly turned round. 
^ I say, dear lady, you know — be kind to her I '* 

'' To Effie ? " Mrs. Beever demanded. 

" To poor Jean." 

Mrs. Beever, after an instant's reflection, took a 
humorous view of his request. ^*I don't know 
why you call her ^ poor ' I She has declined an 
excellent settlement, but she's not in misery yet." 
Then she said to Rose : '' I'll take him first" 

Rose had put down her parasol, pricking the 
point of it, as if with a certain shyness, into the 
close, firm lawn. **If you like, when you take 
Miss Martle " She paused, in deep contem- 
plation of Tony. 

''When I take Miss Martle?" There was a 
new encouragement in Mrs. Beever's voice. 

The apparent effect of this benignity was to 
make Miss Armiger's eyes widen strangely at their 



 2S7 

oompanion. ^ Why, 111 come back and take tlie 
child/' 

Mi8. Beever met this offer with an alertness not 
hitherto markedly characteristic of her intercourse 
with Rose. ^ Fll send her out to you." Then, 
by way of an obeisance to Tony, directing the 
words well at him : ** It won't indeed be a scene 
for that poor Iamb I *' She marched off with her 
duty emblazoned on her sqoare satin back. 

Tony, struck by the massive characters in which 
it was written there, broke into an indulgent 
laugh, but even in his mirth he traced the satis- 
faction she took in letting him see that she 
measured with some complacency the embarrass- 
ment Rose might cause him. ** Does she propose 
to tear Miss Bfartle limb from limb ? '* he humot^ 
ously inquired. 

^ Do you ask that,*' said Rose, ** partly because 
you're apprehensiye that it's what I propose to do 
to you?'* 

**By no means, my dear Rose, after your just 
pving me so marked a sign of the pacific as your 
coming round " 

**0n the question," Rose broke in, **of one's 
relation to that little image and echo of her adored 
mother? That isn't peace, my dear Tony. Ton 



288  

give me just the ocoasioD to let you formally know 
that it's war." 

Tony gave another laugh. ^ War? " 

" Not on you — I pity you too much/* 

** Then on whom ? ** 

Rose hesitated. ^* On anyone^ on everyone, who 
may be likely to find that small child — small as 
she is! — inconvenient Oh, I know/' she went 
on, ^* you'll say I come late in the day for this, and 
you'll remind me of how very short a time ago it 
was that I declined a request of yours to occupy 
myself with her at all. Only half an hour has 
elapsed, but what has happened in it has made all 
the difference." 

She spoke without discernible excitement, and 
Tony had already become aware that the &oe she 
actually showed him was not a thing to make him 
estimate directly the effect wrought in her by the 
incongruous result of the influence he had put 
forth under pressure of her ardour. He needed 
no great imagination to conceive that this con- 
sequence might, on the poor girl's part, well be 
mainly lodged in such depths of her nature as not 
to find an easy or an immediate way to the sur» 
face. That he had her to reckon with he was re- 
minded as soon as he caught across the lawn the 



THX OTHXB HOUSE 289 

sheen of her white dress ; bat what he most felt 
was a lively, unreasoning hope that for the hour 
at least, and until he should have time to turn 
round and see what his own situation exactly con- 
tained for him, her mere incontestable cleverness 
would achieve a revolution during which he might 
take breath. This was not a hope that in any 
way met his difficulties — it was a hope that only 
avoided them; but he had lately had a vision of 
something in which it was still obscure to him 
whether the bitter or the sweet prevailed, and he 
was ready to make almost any terms to be allowed 
to surrender himself to these first quick throbs of 
response to what was at any rate an impression of 
perfect beauty. He was in bliss with a great chill 
and in despair with a great lift, and confused and 
assured and alarmed — divided between the joy 
and the pain of knowing that what Jean Martie 
had done she had done for Atm, and done full in 
the face of all he couldn't do to repay her. That 
Tony Bream might never marry was a simple 
enough affair, but that this rare creature mightn't 
suddenly figured to him as formidable and exquisite. 
Therefore he found his nerves rather indebted to 
Rose for her being — if that was the explanation 
— too proud to be vulgarly vindictive. She knew 



240 THB OTHXB HOXTSX 

his secret, as, eTen after seeing it so freely handled 
by Mrs. Beever, he still rather artlessly called the 
motive of his vain appeal ; knew it better thaa 
before, since she could now read it in the intenser 
light of the knowledge of it betrayed by another. 
If on this advantage he had no reason to look to 
her for generosity, it was at least a comfort that he 
might look to her for good manners. Poor Tony 
had the full consciousness of needing to think oat 
a line, but it weighed somewhat against that oppres- 
sion to feel that Rose also would have it. He 
was only a little troubled by the idea that, ardent 
and subtle, she would probably think fiister than 
he. He turned over a moment the revelation 
of these qualities conveyed in her announcement 
of a change, as he might call it, of policy. 

^ What you say is charming,'* he good-naturedly 
replied, ** so far as it represents an acoeosion to the 
ranks of my daughter's friends. Tou will never 
remind me without touching me how nearly a 
sister you were to her mother ; and I would rather 
express the pleasure I take in that than the bewil- 
derment I feel at your allusion to any class of 
persons whose interest in her may not be sincere. 
The more friends she has, the better — I welcome 
you all. The only thing I ask of you," he went 



 241 

on, smiling, **is not to quarrel about her among 
yourselYes." 

Rose, as she listened, looked almost religiously 
calm, but as she answered there was a profane 
quaver in her Toioe that told him with what an 
effort she achieved that sacrifice to form for which 
he was so pusillanimouslj grateful. **It's very 
good of you to make the best of me ; and it's also 
very clever of you, let me add, my dear Tony — 
and add with all deference to your goodness — to 
succeed in implying that any other course is open 
to you. Tou may welcome me as a friend of the 
child or not. I'm present for her, at any rate, and 
present as I've never been before." 

Tony's gratitude, suddenly contracting, left a 
little edge for irritation. ** You're present, as- 
suredly, my dear Rose, and your presence is to us 
all an advantage of which, happily, we never be- 
come unconscious for an hour. But do I under- 
stand that the firm position among us that you 
allude to is one to which you see your way to at- 
taching any possibility of permanence ? " 

She waited as if scrupulously to detach from its 
stem the flower of irony that had sprouted in this 
speech, and while she inhaled it she gave her vis- 
ible attention only to the little hole in the lawn 



242  

that she continued to prick with the point of her 
parasoL *^ If that's a graceful way of asking me,** 
she returned at last, ^^ whether the end of my visit 
here isn't near at hand, perhaps the best satisfac- 
tion I can give you b to say that I shall probaUy 
stay on at least as long as Miss Martle. What I 
meant, however, just now," she pursued, ^^by saying 
that I'm more on the spot than heretofore, is simply 
that while I do stay I stay to be vigilant. That's 
what I hurried out to let you definitely know, in 
case you should be going home without our meet^ 
ing again. I told you before I went into the house 
that I trusted you — I needn't recall to you for 
what. Mr. Beever after a while came in and told 
me that Miss Martle had refused him. Then I felt 
that, after what had passed between us, it was only 
fair to say to you " 

** That you've ceased to trust me ? " Tony inter- 
rupted. 

^By no means. I don't give and take back." 
And though his companion's handsome head, with 
its fixed, pale face, rose high, it became appi'eciaUy 
handsomer and reached considerably higher, while 
she wore once more the air of looking at his mis- 
take through the enlarging blur of tears. ** As I 
believe you did, in honour, what you could for Mr. 
Beever, I trust you perfectly still." 



THE OTHKB HOUSE 243 

Tony smiled as if he apologised, but as if also he 
couldn't but wonder. ^^ Then it's only fair to say 
tome ?" 

'« That I don't trust Miss MarUe." 

^Oh, my dear woman I" Tony precipitately 
laughed. 

But Rose went on with all deliberation and dis- 
tinctness. ^ That's what has made the difference 
— that's what has brought me, as you say, round 
to a sense of my possible use, or rather of my clear 
obligation. Half an hour ago I knew how much 
you love her. Now I know how much she loves 
you." 

Tony's laugh suddenly dropped ; he showed the 
face of a man for whom a joke has sharply turned 
grave. ** And what is it that, in possession of this 
admirable knowledge, you see ?" 

Rose faltered ; but she had not come so far sim- 
ply to make a botch of it. ^^Why, that it's the 
obvious interest of the person we speak of not to 
have too stupid a patience with any obstacle to her 
marrying you." 

This speech had a quiet lucidity of which the 
odd action was, for an instant, to make him lose 
breath so violently that, in his quick gasp, he felt 
sick. In the indignity of the sensation he struck

oat. ** Pray, why is it the penon^s obyions inte^

*' Seeing that I love you quite as much as she 
does? Because you don't love me quite as much 
as you love her. That's exactly * why,' dear Tony 
Bream I " said Rose Armiger. 

She turned away from him sadly and noUy, as 
if she had done with him and with the subject, 
and he stood where she had left him, gasing at the 
foolish greenness at his feet and slowly passing his 
hand over his head. In a few seconds, however, 
he heard her utter a strange, short cry, and, look- 
ing round, saw her face to face — across the inter- 
val of sloping lawn — with a gentleman whom he 
had been sufficiently prepared to recognise on the 
spot as Dennis VidaL

the apparition which should be profitable to her- 
self. The violence of her surprise made her catch 
the back of the nearest chair, on which she covertly 
rested, directing at her old suitor from this posi- 
tion the widest eyes the master of Bounds had 
ever seen her unwittingly open. To perceive this, 
however, was to be almost simultaneously struck, 
and even to be not a little charmed, with the 
clever quickness of her recovery — that of a per- 
son constitutionally averae to making unmeasured 
displays. Rose was capable of astonishment, as 
she was capable of other kinds of emotion; but 
she was as little capable of giving way to it as she 
was of giving way to other kinds ; so that both of 
her companions immediately saw her moved by 
the sense that a perturbing incident could at the 

246 



246  

worst do her no such evil turn as she might suffer 
by taking it in the wrong way. Tony became 
aware, in addition, that the fact communicated to 
him by Mrs. Beever gave him an advantage even 
over the poor fellow whose face, as he stood there, 
showed the traces of an insufficient forecast of two 
things : one of them the influence on all his pulses 
of the sight again, after such an interval, and in 
the high insolence of life and strength, of the 
woman he had lost and still loved ; the other the 
instant effect on his imagination of his finding her 
intimately engaged with the man who had been, 
however without fault, the occasion of her perver- 
sity. Vidal's marked alertness had momentarily 
fitiled him ; he paused in his advance long enough 
to give Tony, after noting and regretting his agi- 
tation, time to feel that Rose was already as 
colourlessly bland as a sensitive woman could 
wish to be. 

All this made the silence, however brief — and 
it was much briefer than my account of it — vi- 
brate to such a tune as to prompt Tony to speak 
as soon as possible in the interest of harmony. 
What directly concerned him was that he had last 
seen Vidal as his own duly appreciative guest, and 
he offered him a hand freely charged with re- 



THE OTHSB HOUSE 247 

minders of that quality. He was refreshed and 
even a little surprised to observe that the young 
man took it, after all, without stiffness ; but the 
strangest thing in the world was that as he cor^ 
dially brought him up the bank he had a mystic 
glimpse of the fact that Rose Armiger, with her 
heart in her throat, was waiting for some sign as 
to whether she might, for the benefit of her inter- 
course with himself, safely take the ground of 
having expected what had happened — having 
perhaps even brought it about. She naturally 
took counsel of her fears, and Tony, suddenly 
more elated than he could have given a reason for 
being, was ready to concur in any attempt she 
might make to save her appearance of knowing no 
reproach. Tet, foreseeing the awkwardness that 
might arise from her committing herself too 
rashly, he made haste to say to Vidal that he 
would have been startled if he had not been fore- 
warned: Mrs. Beever had mentioned to him the 
visit she had just received. 

*^ Ah, she told you ? " Dennis asked. 

^*Me only — as a great sign of confidence," Tony 
laughed. 

Rose, at this, could be amazed with superiority. 
** What? — you've already been here ? " 



248 THB OTHBB HOUSB 

**An hour ago," said Dennia. **I aaked Bin. 
Beever not to tell you." 

That was a chance for positiye criticism. ^ She 
obeyed yoor request to the letter. But why in 
the world such portentous secrecy ? " Rose spoke 
as if there was no shade of a reason for his feel- 
ing shy, and now gave him an excellent exam- 
ple of the right tone. She had emulated Tony's 
own gesture of welcome, and he said to himself 
that no young woman could have stretched a 
more elastic arm across a desert of four eold 
years. 

** I can explain to you better,** Dennis replied, 
*^ why I emerged than why I yamshed.** 

*^ Tou emerged, I suppose, because you wanted 
to see me." Rose spoke to one of her admirers, 
but she looked, she even laughed, at the other, 
showing him by this time an aspect completely 
and inscrutably renewed. ^Tou knew I was 
here?'* 

^ At Wilverley ? ** Dennis hesiteted. « I took it 
for granted.** 

^ I'm afraid it was really for Miss Armiger you 
came,** Tony remarked in the spirit of pleasantry. 
It seemed to him that the spirit of pleasantty 
would help them on. 



THB OTHER HOUSE 249 

It bad its result — it proved contagious. *^I 
would stall say so — before ber — even if it 
weren't I" Dennis returned. 

Rose took up the joke. ^ Fortunately it's true 
— so it saves you a fib." 

** It saves me a fib I " Dennis said. 

In tbis way tbe trick was successfully played 
— they found their feet; with the added amuse- 
ment, for Tony, of hearing the necessary falsehood 
uttered neither by himself nor by Rose, but by a 
man whose veracity, from the first, on that earlier 
day, of looking at him, he had felt to be almost 
incompatible with the flow of conversation. It 
was more and more distinct while the minutes 
elapsed that the secondary effect of her old 
friend's reappearance was to make Rose shine 
with a more convenient light; and she met her 
embarrassment, every way, with so happy an art 
that Tony was moved to deplore afresh the com- 
plication that estranged him from a woman of 
such gifts. It made up indeed a little for this 
that he was also never so possessed of his own 
as when there was something to carry off or to 
put, as the phrase was, through. His light hand, 
his slightly florid facility were the things that in 
managing, in presiding, had rendered him so 



250  

widely popular ; and wasn't he, precisely, a little 
presiding, wasn't he a good deal managing, just 
now? Vidal would be a blessed diversion — espe- 
cially if he should be pressed into the service as 
one : Tony was content for the moment to see this 
with eagerness rather than to see it whole. His 
eagerness was justified by the circumstance that 
the young man from China did somehow or other 
— the reasons would appear after the fact — repre- 
sent relief, relief not made vain by the reflection 
that it was perhaps only temporary. Rose her- 
self, thank Heaven, was, with all her exaltation, 
only temporary. He could already condone the 
officiousness of a gentleman too interested in 
Effie's equilibrium: the grounds of that indiscre- 
tion gleamed agreeably through it as soon as he 
had seen the visitor's fingers draw together over 
the hand held out by Rose. It was matter to 
whistle over, to bustle over, that, as had been cer- 
tified by Mrs. Beever, the passion betrayed by 
that clasp had survived its shipwreck, and there 
wasn't a rope's end Tony could throw, or a stray 
stick he could hold out, for which he didn't imme- 
diately cast about him. He saw indeed from this 
moment his whole comfort in the idea of an organ- 
ised rescue and of making the struggling swimmer 



THE OTHSB HOUSE 251 

know, as a preliminary, how little anyone at the 
other house was interested in preventing him to 
land. 

Vidal had, for that matter, not been three min- 
utes in touch with him before he really began to 
see this happy perception descend. It was, in a 
manner, to haul him ashore to invite him to dine 
and sleep ; which Tony lost as little time as pos- 
sible in doing; expressing the hope that he had 
not gone to the inn and that even if he had he 
would consent to the quick transfer of his effects 
to Bounds. Dennis showed that he had still some 
wonder for such an overture, but before he could 
respond to it the words were taken out of his 
mouth by Rose, whose recovery from her upset 
was complete from the moment she could seize a 
pretext for the extravagance of tranquillity. 

*^ Why should you take him away from us, and 
why should he consent to be taken? Won't Mrs. 
Beever," Rose asked of Dennis — ^* since you're 
not snatching the fearful joy of a clandestine visit 
to her — expect you, if you stay anywhere, to give 
her the preference ? " 

^^ Allow me to remind you, and to remind Mr. 
Vidal," Tony returned, ** that when he was here 
before he gave her the preference. Mrs. Beever 



252 THE OTHSB HOUSE 

made no scruple of removing him bodily from 
under my roof. I forfeited — I was obliged to — 
the pleasure of a visit to him. But that leaves 
me with my loss to make up and my revenge to 
take — I repay Mrs. Beever in kind." To find 
Rose disputing with him the possession of their 
friend filled him with immediate cheer. ^ Don't 
you recognise," he went on to him, ** the propriety 
of what I propose? I take you and deal with 
Mrs. Beever, as she took you and dealt with me. 
Besides, your things have not even been brought 
here as they had of old been brought to Bounds. 
I promise to share you with these ladies and not 
to grudge you the time you may wish to spend 
with Miss Armiger. I understand but too well 
the number of hours I shall find you putting in. 
You shall pay me a long visit and come over here 
as often as you like, and your presence at Bounds 
may even possibly have the consequence of mak- 
ing them honour me there a little oftener with 
their own." 

Vidal looked from one of his companions to the 
other; he struck Tony as slightly mystified, but 
not beyond the point at which curiosity was agree- 
able. ^* I think I had better go to Mr. Bream," he 
after a moment sturdily said to Rose. ^* There's 



 253 

a matter on which I wish to talk with you, but 
I don^t see that that need prevent/' 

^It's for you to determine. There's a matter 
on which I find myself, to you also, particularly 
glad of the opportunity of saying a word." 

Tony glanced promptly at his watch and at Rose. 
"Your opportunity's before you — say your word 
now. I've a little job in the town," he explained 
to Vidal ; " I must attend to it quickly, and I can 
easily stop at the hotel and give directions for the 
^" noval of your traps. All you will have to do, 
then, will be to take the short way, which you 
know — over the bridge there and through my 
garden — to my door. We shall dine at an easy 
eight." 

Dennis Vidal assented to this arrangement 
without qualification and indeed almost without 
expression: there evidently lingered in him an 
operative sense that there were compensations 
Mr. Bream might be allowed the luxurious con- 
sciousness of owing him. Rose, however, showed 
she still had a communication to make to Tony, 
who had begun to move in the quarter leading 
straight from Eastmead to the town, so that he 
would have to pass near the house on going out. 
She introduced it with a question about his move- 



254  

mentB. ** Toull stop, then, on your waj and tell 
Mrs, Beever ?" 

««0f my having appropriated our friend? Not 
this moment," said Tony — ^^ IVe to meet a man 
on business, and I shall only just have time. I 
shall, if possible, come back here, but meanwhile 
perhaps you'll kindly explain. Come straight 
over and take possession,'* he added, to Vidal; 
*^make yourself at home — don't wait for me to 
return to you." He offered him a hand-ehake 
again, and then, with his native impulse to accom- 
modate and to harmonise making a friendly light 
in his face, he offered one to Rose herself. She 
accepted it so frankly that she even, for a minute, 
kept his hand — a response that he approved with 
a smile so encouraging that it scarcely needed 
even the confirmation of speech. They stood 
there while Dennis Vidal turned away as if they 
might have matters between them, and Tony 
yielded to the impulse to prove to Rose that, 
though there were things he kept from her, he 
kept nothing that was not absolutely necessary. 
^^ There's something else I've got to do — I've 
got to stop at the Doctor's." 

Rose raised her eyebrows. *^ To consult him ? " 

*' To ask him to come over." 



 255 

** I hope you're not ill." 

** Never better in my life. I want him to see 
Effie." 

"iSa«'8 not ill, surely ?•' 

^ She's not right — with the fright Ooriiam had 
this morning. So I'm not satisfied." 

** Let him then by all means see her," Rose said. 

Their talk had, through the action of Vidal's 
presence, dropped from its chilly height to the 
warmest domestic level, and what now stuck out 
of Tony was the desire she should understand 
that on such ground as that he was always glad 
to meet her. Dennis Vidal faced about again in 
time to be called, as it were, if only by the tone 
of his host's voice, to witness this. ^*A bientdL 
Let me hear from you — and from him — that in 
my absence you've been extremely kind to our 
friend here." 

Rose, with a small but vivid fevernspot in her 
cheek, looked from one of the men to the other, 
while her kindled eyes showed a gathered purpose 
that had the prompt and perceptible effect of ex- 
citing suspense. ** I don't mind letting you know, 
Mr. Bream, in advance exactly how kind I shall be. 
It would be affectation on my part to pretend to 
be unaware of your already knowing something of 



256  

what has passed between this genilsinaii mad me. 
He saffered, at my hands, in this place, four yean 
ago, a disappointment — a disappointment into the 
rights and wrongs, into the good reasons of which 
I won't attempt to go further than just to say that 
an inevitable publicity then attached to it.'* She 
spoke with slow and deliberate clearness, still look- 
ing from Tony to Vidal and back again; after 
which her strange intensity fixed itself on her old 
suitor. ^'People saw, Mr. Vidal," she went od, 
*Hhe blight that descended on our long relations, 
and people believed — and I was at the time in- 
different to their believing — that it had occurred 
by my act. Fm not indifferent now — that is to 
any appearance of having been wanting in consid- 
eration for such a man as you. I've often wished 
I might make you some reparation — some open 
atonement. I'm sorry for the distress that I'm 
afraid I caused you, and here, before the principal 
witness of the indignity you so magnanimously 
met, I very sincerely express my regret and very 
humbly beg your forgiveness." Dennis Vidal, 
staring at her, had turned dead white as she kept 
it up, and the quiet nobleness of her inspired pen- 
ance had lNn)ught tears into Tony's eyes. She 
saw them there as she looked at him once more. 



THE OTHBB HOU8B 267 

and she measured the effect she produced upon 
him. She visibly and excusably enjoyed it, and 
after a moment's pause she handsomely and pa- 
thetically completed it. ^ That^ Mr. Bream — for 
your injunction of kindness — is the kindness I'm 
capable of showing." 

Tony turned instantly to their companion, who 
now stood staring hard at the ground. ** I change, 
then, my appeal — I make it, with confidence, to 
jfim. Let me hear, Mr. Vidal, when we meet 
again, that you've not been capable of less I" 
Dennis, deeply moved, it was plain, but self-con- 
scions and stiff, gave no sign of having heard him ; 
and Rose, on her side, walked away a little, like 
an actress who had launched her great stroke. 
Tony, between them, hesitated ; then he laughed 
in a manner that showed he felt safe. **0h, 
you're both all right!" he declared; and with 
another glance at his watch he bounded off to 
his business. He drew, as he went, a long breath 
— filled his lungs with the sense that he should 
after all have a margin. She would take Vidal 
back. 



XXIV 

^ Why did you do that ? " Dennis asked as soon 
as he was alone with Rose. 

She had sunk into a seat at a distance from him^ 
all spent with her great response to her sndden 
opportunity for justice* His challenge brought 
her flight to earth; and after waiting a moment 
she answered him with a question that betrayed 
her sense of coming down. ** Do you really care, 
after all this time, what I do or don't do ? " 

His rejoinder to this was in turn only another 
demand. ^What business is it of las that you 
may have done this or that to me? What has 
passed between us is stiU between us : nobody else 
has anything to do with it." 

Rose smiled at him as if to thank him for being 
again a trifle sharp with her. ** He wants me, as 
he said, to be kind to you." 

^Tou mean he wants you to do that sort of 
thing?" His sharpness brought him step by step 



 259 

across the lawn and nearer to her. ^^ Do you care 
•o very much what he wants?" 

Again she hesitated; then, with her pleased, 
patient smile, she tapped the empty place on the 
bench. ** Come and sit down beside me, and I 'U 
tell you how much I care." He obeyed her, but 
not precipitately, approaching her with a delibera- 
tion which still held her off a little, made her ob- 
jective to his inspection or his mistrust. He had 
said to Mrs. Beever that he had not come to watch 
her, but we are at liberty to wonder what Mrs. 
Beever might have called the attitude in which, 
before seating himself, he stopped before her with 
a silent stare. She met him at any rate with a 
face that told him there was no scrutiny she was 
now enough in the wrong to fear, a face that was 
all the promise of confession and submission and 
sacrifice. She tapped again upon her bench, and 
at this he sat down. Then she went on : ** When 
did you come back?" 

"To England? The other day — I don't re- 
member which of them. I think you ought to 
answer my question," Vidal said, "before asking 
any more of your own." 

"No, no," she replied, promptly but gently; 
"there's an inquiry it seems to me I've a right 



260 THE OTHSft HOT78S 

to make of you before I admit yours to make any 
at all." She looked at him as if to give him tim« 
either to assent or to object; but he only sat 
rather stiffly back and let her see how fine and 
firm the added years had hammered him. ^^ What 
are you really here for? Has it anything to do 
with fiw^'* 

Dennis remained profoundly grave. **I didn't 
know you were here — I had no reason to/' he at 
last replied. 

^ Then you simply desired the pleasure of renew- 
ing your acquaintance with Mrs. Beever?" 

** I came to ask her about you." 

**How beautiful of you I" — and Rose's tone, 
untinged with irony, rang out as clear a^ the 
impulse it praised. *^ Fancy your caring I" she 
added; after which she continued: *^As I under- 
stand you, then, youVe had your chance, you've 
talked with her." 

*'A very short time. I put her a question or 
two." 

*^ I won't ask you what they were," said Rose : 
^^ rU only say that, since I happen to be here« it 
may be a comfort to you not to have to content 
yourself with information at secondhand. Ask 
me what you like. I'll tell you everything." 



THK OTHKB HOU8B 261 



Her companion considered. ** Yon might then 
begin hy telling me what IVe already asked.** 

She took him up before he conld go on. '*Oh, 
why I attached an importance to his hearing what 
I jnst now said? Tea, yes; you shaU have it'* 
She turned it over as if with the sole thought of 
giving it to him with the utmost lucidity; then 
she was visibly struck with the help she would 
derive from knowing just one thing more. ** But 
first — are you at all jealous of him?*' 

Dennis Vidal broke into a laugh which might 
have been a tribute to her rare audacity, yet which 
somehow, at the same time, made him seem only 
more serious. ** That*s a thing for you to find out 
for youTBclf I " 

^ I see — I see.'* She looked at him with mus- 
ing, indulgent eyes. ^ It would be too wonderful. 
Tet otherwise, after all, why should you care ? '* 

^* I don't mind telling you frankly," said Dennis, 
while, with two fingers softly playing upon her 
lower lip, she sat estimating the possibility she 
had named — ^* I don't mind telling you frankly 
that I asked Mrs. Beever if you were still in love 
with him." 

She clasped her hands so eagerly that she almost 
clapped them. ** Then you do care ? " 



262 THE OTHER HOU8B 

He was looking beyond her now — at something 
at the other end of the garden ; and he made no 
other reply than to say: **She didn't give you 
away." 

*^ It was very good of her ; but I would tell you 
myself, you know, perfectly, if I were." 

^* You didn't tell me perfectly four years ago,'' 
Dennis returned. 

Rose hesitated a minute; but this didn't pre- 
vent her speaking with an effect of great prompti* 
tude. ^* Oh, four years ago I was the biggest fool 
in England I " 

Dennis, at this, met her eyes again. **Then 
what I asked Mrs. Beever " 

** Isn't true ? " Rose caught him up. ^ It's an 
exquisite position," she said, ^ for a woman to be 
questioned as you question me, and to have to 
answer as I answer you. But it's your revenge, 
and you've already seen that to your revenge 
I minister with a certain amount of resolution." 
She let him look at her a minute; at last she 
said without flinching: ^^I'm not in love with 
Anthony Bream." 

Dennis shook his head sadly. ** What does that 
do for my revenge 7 " 

Rose had another quick flush. ** It shows you 



 268 

what I consent to discuss with you,*' she rather 
proudly replied. 

He turned his eyes back to the quarter to which 
he had directed them before. ** You do consent ? " 

** Can you ask — after what I've done ? " 

** Well, then ; he no longer cares ? " 

^ For me ?'' said Rose. ^ He never cared." 

"Never?" 

** Never." 

** Upon your honour ? " 

** Upon my honour." 

" But you had an idea ? " Dennis bravely 

pursued. 

Rose as dauntlessly met him. " I had an idea." 

** And you* ve had to give it up ? " 

" I've had to give it up." 

Dennis was silent ; he slowly got upon his feet. 

^ Well — that does something." 

"For your revenge?" She sounded a bitter 
laugh. " I should think it might I What it does 
is magnificent I " 

He stood looking over her head till at last he 
exclaimed : " So, apparently, is the child I" 

" She has come ? " Rose sprang up to find that 
EflSe had been borne toward them, across the 
grass, in the arms of the muscular Manning, who. 



264 THB OTHER HO08B 

having stooped to set her down and given her » 
vigorous impulsion from behind, recovered the 
military stalare and poetute. 

*^Yoa're to take her, Miss, please — from Mn* 
Beever. And you^re to keep her." 

Rose had already greeted the little visitor. 
^* Please assure Mra. Beever that I will. She's 
with Miss Martle?" 

*^ She is indeed, Miss.*' Manning always spoke 
without emotion, and the effect of it on this occa- 
sion was to give her the air of speaking without 
pity. 

Rose, however, didn't mind that. ^She may 
trust me," she said, while Manning saluted and 
retired. Then she stood before her old suitor with 
Effie blooming on her shoulder. 

He frankly wondered and admired. ^ She's 
magnilScent — she's magnificent I " he repeated. 
She's magnificent!" Rose ardently echoed. 

Aren't you, my very own?" she demanded of 
the child with a sudden passion of tenderness. 

**What did he mean about her wanting the 
Doctor ? She'll see us all through — every blessed 
one of us t " Dennis gave himself up to his serious 
interest, an odd, voraoious manner of taking her in 
from top to toe.

^ You look at her like an ogre I '* Rose laughed, 
moving away from him with her burden, and preaa- 
ing to her lips, as she went, a little plump pink 
arm. She pretended to munch it; she covered 
it with kisses; she gave way to the joy of her 
renounced abstention. ^^See us all through? — 
I hope sol Why shouldn't you, darling — why 
shouldn't you? You've got a real friend — you 
have, you duck; and she sees you know what 
you've got by the wonderful way you look at her I " 
This was to attribute to the little girl's solemn 
stare a vividness of meaning which moved Dennis 
to hilarity ; Rose's profession of confidence made 
her immediately turn her round face, over her 
friend's shoulder, to the gentleman who was stroll- 
ing behind and whose public criticism, as well as 
his public mirth, appeared to arouse in her only a 
soft sense of superiority. Rose sat down again 
where she had sat before, keeping Effie in her lap 
and smoothing out her fine feathers. Then their 
companion, after a little more detached contem- 
plation, also took his former place. 

^She makes me remember!" he presently 
observed. 

^ That extraordinary scene — poor Julia's mes- 
sage ? You can fancy whether I f oiget it ! " 



266  

Dennis was silent a little ; after which he said 
quietly: ^^ You've more to keep it in mind.*' 

** I can assure you I've plenty I " Rose replied. 

**And the young lady who was also present: 
isn't she the Miss Martle ?" 

^^ Whom I spoke of to that woman ? She's the 
Miss Martle. What about her ? " Rose asked with 
her cheek against the child's. 

^^Does she also remember?" 

*^ Like you and me ? I haven't the least idea." 

Once more Dennis paused: his pauses were 
filled with his friendly gaze at their small compan- 
ion. ^ She's here again — like you 7 " 

^* And like you ? " Rose smiled. ** No, not like 
either of us. She's always here." 

** And it's from her you're to keep a certain 
little person?" 

^ It's from her." Rose spoke with rich brevity. 

Dennis hesitated. ^^ Would you trust the little 
person to another little person?" 

^^To you — to hold?" Rose looked amused. 
** Without a pang I" The child, at this, pro- 
foundly meditative and imperturbably** good," sub- 
mitted serenely to the transfer and to the prompt, 
long kiss which, as he gathered her to him, Dennis, 
in his turn, imprinted on her arm. ^^ I'll stay with 



 267 

yau!*^ she declared with expression; on which he 
renewed, with finer relish, the freedom she per- 
mitted, Assuring her that this settled the question 
and that he was her appointed champion. Rose 
watched the passage between them, which was 
charming ; then she brought out abruptly : *^ What 
I said to Mr. Bream just now I didn't say for Mr. 
Bream." 

Dennis had the litUe girl close to him ; his arms 
were softly round her and, like Rose's just before, 
his cheek, as he tenderly bent his head, was pressed 
against her cheek. His eyes were on their com- 
panion. **You said it for Mr. Vidal? He liked 
it, all the same, better than I," he replied in a 
moment. 

^* Of course he liked it ! But it doesn't matter 
what he likes," Rose added. **Ab for you — I 
don't know that your * liking' it was what I 
wanted." 

**What then did you want?" 

^^That you should see me utterly abased — and 
all the more utterly that it was in the cruel pres- 
ence of another." 

Dennis had raised his head and sunk back into 
the angle of the bench, separated from her by such 
space as it jrielded. His face, presented to her 



268 THE OTHBB HOUSE 

over Effie*8 curls, was a lean mixture of many 
mystifications. ^^ Why in the world should that 
give me pleasure?" 

"^ Why in the world shouldn't it?" Rose asked. 
" What's your revenge but pleasure ? " 

She had got up again in her dire restlessness ; 
she glowed there in the perversity of her sacrifice. 
If he hadn't come to Wilverley to watch her, his 
wonde]>etricken air much wronged him. He shook 
his head again with his tired patience. ** Oh, damn 
pleasure I " he exclaimed. 

*^Your triumph^s nothing to you?" Rose cried. 
**Then if it isn't, perhaps you pity me?" She 
shone at him as if with the glimpse of a new 
hope. 

He took it in, but he only after a moment echoed 
ambiguously her word. " Pity you ? " 

**I think you would, Dennis, if you under- 
stood." 

He looked at her hard; he hesitated. At last 
he returned quietly, but relentingly : ^* Well, Rose, 
I dinCt understand." 

** Then I must go through it all — I must empty 
the cup. Yes, I must tell you." 

She paused so long, however, beautiful, candid, 
and tragic, looking in the face her necessity, but 



THB OTHEB H0U8B 269 

gathering herself for her effort, that, after waiting 
awhile, he spoke. ^ Tell me what ? " 

** That I'm simply at your feet. That I'm yours 
to do what you will with — to take or to cast away. 
Perhaps you taiU care for your triumph," she said, 
** when you see in it the grand opportunity I give 
you. It's your turn to refuse now — you can 
treat me exactly as you were treated I " 

A deep, motionless silence followed, between 
them, this speech, which left them confronted as if 
it had rather widened than bridged their separa- 
tion. Before Dennis found his answer to it the 
sharp tension snapped in a clear, glad exclamation. 
The child threw out her arms and her Toice: 
^ Auntie Jean, Auntie Jean I "

The others had been so absorbed that ihej 
had not seen Jean Martle approach, and she, on 
her side, was close to them before appearing to 
perceive a stranger in the gentleman who held 
Effie in his lap and whom she had the air of 
haying assumed, at a greater distance, to be 
Anthony Bream. £ffie*s reach toward her friend 
was so effective that, with Vidars obligation to 
rise, it enabled her to slip from his hands and 
rush to avail herself of the embrace offered 
her, in spite of a momentary arrest, by Jean. 
Rose, however, at the sight of this movement, 
was quicker than Jean to catch her; she seized 
her almost with violence, and, holding her as 
8he had held her before, dropped again upon 
the bench and presented her as a yielding cap> 
tive. This act of appropriation was confirmed 
by the flash of a fine glance — a single gleam, 
but direct — which, however, producing in Jean^s 

270 



 271 

fair face no retort, had only the effect of mak- 
ing her look, in gracious recognition, at Dennis. 
He had evidently, for the moment, nothing but 
an odd want of words to meet her with; but 
this, precisely, gave her such a sense of having 
disturbed a scene of intimacy that, to be doubly 
courteous, she said : '* Perhaps you remember 
me. We were here together " 

"Four years ago — perfectly," Rose broke in, 
speaking for him with an amenity that might 
have been intended as a quick corrective of 
any impression conveyed by her grab of the 
child. "Mr. Vidal and I were just talking of 
you. He has come back, for the first time since 
then, to pay us a little visit." 

"Then he has things to say to you that I've 
rudely interrupted. Please excuse me — I'm off 
again," Jean went on to Dennis. "I only came 
for the little girl." She turned back to Rose. 
"I'm afraid it's time I should take her home." 

Rose sat there like a queen-regent with a 
baby sovereign on her knee. "Must I give her 
up to you?" 

"I'm responsible for her, you know, to Gor- 
ham," Jean returned. 

Rose gravely kissed her little ward, who, now 



272  

that she was apparently to be offered the enter- 
tainment of a debate in which she was 00 
closely concerned, was clearly prepared to con- 
tribute to it the calmness of impartial beaaty 
at a joust. She was just old enough to be in* 
terested, but she was just young enough to be 
judicial; the lap of her present friend had the 
compass of a small child-world, and she perched 
there in her loveliness as if she had been Helen 
on the walls of Troy. ^ It's not to Gorham J*m 
responsible," Rose presently answered. 

Jean took it good-humouredly. ^^Are you to 
Mr. Bream?" 

** I'll tell you presently to whom." And Rose 
looked intelligently at Dennis Vidal. 

Smiled at in alternation by two clever young 
women, he had yet not, sufSciently to adueye 
a jocose manner, shaken off his sense of the 
strange climax of his conversation with the 
elder of them. He turned about awkwardly, 
as he had done four years before, for the hat 
it was one of the privileges of such a collo- 
quy to make him put down in an odd place. 
*^ril go over to Bounds," he said to Rose. 
And then to Jean, to take leave of her: ^^Fm 
staying at the other house." 



 278 

"« Really? Mr. Bi^am didn't tell me. Bat I 
most never drive you away. You've more to 
say to Miss Armiger than I have. I've only 
come to get Effie," Jean repeated. 

Dennis at this, brushing off his recovered hat, 
gave way to his thin laugh. ^^That, apparently, 
may take you some time!" 

Rose generously helped him off. *^I've more 
to say to Miss Martle than I've now to say to 
you. I think that what I've already said to 
you is quite enough." 

^^ Thanks, thanks — quite enough. I'll just 
go over." 

"You won't go first to Mrs. Beever?" 

" Not yet — I'll come in this evening. Thanks, 
thanks!" Denms repeated with a sudden dra- 
matic gaiety that was presumably intended to 
preserve appearances — to acknowledge Rose's 
aid and, in a spirit of reciprocity, cover any 
exposure she might herself have incurred. Rais- 
ing his hat, he passed down the slope and 
disappeared, leaving our young ladies face to 
face. 

Their situation might still have been embar- 
rassing had Rose not taken immediate measures 
to give it a lift. "You must let me have the 



274 THB OTHBB HOITBB 

pleasure of making you the first person to hear 
of a matter that closely concerns me/' She 
hung fire, watching her companion; then she 
brought out: ^^Fm engaged to be married to 
Mr. Vidal." 

*^ Engaged?*' — Jean almost bounded forward, 
holding up her relief like a torch. 

Rose greeted with laughter this natural note. 
^^He arrived half an hour ago, for a supreme 
appeal — and it has not, you see, taken long. 
I've just had the honour of accepting him." 

Jean's movement had brought her so close to 
the bench that, though slightly disconcerted by 
its action on her friend, she could only, in con- 
sistency, seat herself. ^That's very charming 
— I congratulate you." 

^^It's charming of you to be so glad," Rose 
returned. ^^ However, you've the news in all 
its freshness." 

^^I appreciate that too," said Jean. ^But 
fancy my dropping on a conversation of such 
importance I " 

^^ Fortunately you didn't cut it short. We had 
settled the question. He had got his answer.** 

*^If I had known it I would have congratu- 
lated Mr. Vidal," Jean pursued. 



 275 

*^Tou would have frightened him out of his 
wits — he's so dreadfully shy I" Rose laughed. 

««Yes — I could see he was dreadfully shy. 
But the great thing/' Jean candidly added, ^is 
that he was not too dreadfully shy to come 
back to you." 

Rose continued to be moved to mirth. **0h, 
I don't mean with me! He's as bold with me 
as I am — for instance — with you." Jean had 
not touched the child, but Rose smoothed out 
her ribbons as if to redress some previous free- 
dom. ^^Tou'U think that says everything. I 
can easQy imagine how you judge my frank- 
ness," she added. **But of course I'm grossly 
immodest — I always was." 

Jean wistfully watched her light hands play 
here and there over Effie's adornments. **I 
think you're a person of great courage — if 
you'll let me also be frank. There's nothing 
in the world I admire so much — for I don't 
consider that I've, myself, a great deal. I dare- 
say, however, that I should let you know just 
as soon if I were engaged." 

** Which, unfortunately, is exactly what you're 
not!" Rose, having finished her titivation of 
the child, sank comfortably back on the bench. 



276 THB OTHBB HOI7BB 

^Do you object to my spetking to yoa of 
that?'' she asked. 

Jean hesitated; she had only after letting 
them escape become conscious of the reach of 
her words, the inadvertence of which showed 
how few waves of emotion her scene with Paul 
Beever had left to subside. She colonred as she 
replied : ** I don't know how much yon know." 

** I know everything," said Rose. ^ Mr. Beever 
has already told me." 

Jean's flush, at this, deepened. **Mr. Beever 
already doesn't care I" 

** That's fortunate for yoii, my dear I Will you 
let me tell you," Rose continued^ ^* how much / 
do?" 

Jean again hesitated, looking, however, through 
her embarrassment, very straight and sweet. *^ I 
don't quite see that it's a thing you should tell me 
or that I'm really obliged to hear. It's very good 
of you to take an interest " 

** But however good it may be, it's none of my 
business: is that what you mean? " Rose broke in. 
**Such an answer is doubtless natural enough. 
My having hoped you would accept Paul Beever, 
and above all my having rather publicly expressed 
that hope, is an apparent stretch of discretion that 



THE OTHBB H0I7BS 277 

yoa're perfectlj free to take up. But joa must 
allow me to say that the stretch is more apparent 
than real. There's discretion and discretion — 
and it*8 all a matter of motive. Pethaps you can 
g^ess mine for haying found a reassurance in the 
idea of your definitely bestowing your hand. It's 
a very small and a very pretty hand, but its possi- 
ble action is out of proportion to its size and even 
to its beauty. It was not a question of meddling 
in your affairs — your affairs were only one side of 
the matter. My interest was wholly in the effect 
of your marriage on the affairs of others. Let me 
say, moreover/* Rose went smoothly and inex- 
orably on, while Jean, listening intently, drew 
shorter breaths and looked away, as if in growing 
pain, from the wonderful white, mobile mask that 
supplied half the meaning of this speech — ^let 
me say, moreover, that it strikes me you hardly 
treat me with fairness in forbidding me an allusion 
that has after all so much in common with the 
fact, in my own situation, as to which you've no 
scruple in showing me your exuberant joy. You 
clap your hands over my being — if youll forgive 
the vulgarity of my calling things by their names 
— got out of the way ; yet I must suffer in silence 
to see you rather more in it than ever." 



278 XHB OTHER HOUSE 

Jean turned again upon her companion a faoe 
bewildered and alarmed: unguardedly stepping 
into water that she had believed shallow, she 
found herself caught up in a current of fast-mov- 
ing depths — a cold, full tide that set straight out 
to sea. ** Where am I?*' her scared silence 
seemed for the moment to ask. Her quick intelli- 
gence indeed, came to her aid, and she spoke in a 
voice out of which she showed that she tried to 
keep her heart-beats. ^ You call things, certainly, 
by names that are extraordinary; but I, at any 
rate, follow you far enough to be able to remind 
you that what I just said about your engagement 
was provoked by your introducing the subject." 

Rose was silent a moment, but without preju- 
dice, clearly, to her firm possession of the ground 
she stood on — a power to be effectively cool in ex* 
act proportion as her interlocutress was troubled. 
^' I introduced the subject for two reasons. One 
of them was that your eager descent upon us at 
that particular moment seemed to present you 
in the light of an inquirer whom it would be 
really rude not to gratify. The other was just 
to see if you would succeed in restraining your 
glee.'* 

^ Then your story isn't true ? " Jean asked 



 279 

a promptitude that betrayed the limits of her cir- 
cumspection. 

** There you are again!'' Rose laughed. '*Do 
you know your apprehensions are barely decent? 
I haven't, however, laid a trap with a bait that's 
all make-believe. It's perfectly true that Mr. 
Vidal has again pressed me hard — it's not true 
that I've yet given him an answer completely 
final. But as I mean to at the earliest moment, 
you can say so to whomever you like." 

^^I can surely leave the saying so to you.'" 
Jean returned. *^ But I shall be sorry to appear 
to have treated you with a want of confidence 
that may give you a complaint to make on the 
score of my mannera — as to which you set me 
too high an example by the rare perfection of 
your own. Let me simply let you know, then, to 
cover every possibility of that sort, that I intend, 
under no circumstances — ever — ever — to marry. 
So far as that knowledge may satisfy you, you're 
welcome to the satisfaction. Perhaps in consid- 
eration of it," Jean wound up, with an effect that 
must have struck her own ear as the greatest she 
had ever produced — ^* perhaps in consideration of 
it you'll kindly do what I ask you." 

The poor girl was destined to see her effect 



280 THE OTHBB HOUSE 

reduced to her mere personal sense of it. Rose 
made no movement save to lay her hands on 
Effie's shoulders, while that young lady looked up 
at the friend of other occasions in round-eyed 
detachment, following the talk enough for curi* 
osity, but not enough either for comprehension 
or for agitation. **You take my surrender for 
granted, I suppose, because you've worked so 
long to produce the impression, which no one, for 
your good fortune, has gainsaid, that she's safe 
only in your hands. But I gainsay it at last, for 
her safety becomes a very different thing from the 
moment you give such a glimpse of your open 
field as you must excuse my still continuing to 
hold that you do give. My * knowledge ' — to use 
your term — that you'll never marry has exactly 
as much and as little weight as your word for it 
I leave it to your conscience to estimate that 
wonderful amount. Tou say too much — both 
more than I ask you and more than I can oblige 
you by prescribing to myself to take seriously. 
Tou do thereby injustice to what must be always 
on the cards for you — the possible failure of the 
great impediment. JTm disinterested in the matter 
— I shall marry, as I've had the honour to inform 
you, without having to think at all of impedi* 



 281 

tnent3 or failures. That*8 the difference between 
us, and it seems to me that it alters everything. 
I bad a delicacy — but now I've nothing in the 
world but a fear.*' 

Jean had got up before these remarks had gone 
far, but even though she fell back a few steps her 
dismay was a force that condemned her to take 
them in. ^^ God forbid I should understand you," 
she panted ; ^ I only make out that you say and 
mean horrible things, and that you're doing your 
best to seek a quarrel with me from which you 
shall derive some advantage that, I'm happy to 
feel, is beyond my conception." Both the women 
were now as pale as death, and Rose was brought 
to her feet by the pure passion of this retort 
The manner of it was such as to leave Jean noth- 
ing but to walk away, which she instantly pro- 
ceeded to do. At the end of ten paces, however, 
she turned to look at their companion, who stood 
beside Rose, held by the hand, and whom, as if 
from a certain consideration for infant innocence 
and a certain instinct of fair play, she had not 
attempted to put on her side by a single direct 
appeal from intimate eyes. This appeal she now 
risked, and the way the little girl's face mutely 
met it suddenly precipitated her to blind supplica- 



282 THE OTHBB HOUSE 

tion. She became weak — she broke down. ^I 
beseech you to let me have her.*' 

Rose Armiger*s countenance made no secret of 
her appreciation of this collapse. ^1*11 let you 
have her on one condition," she presently replied. 

** What condition?'* 

*^ That you deny to me on the spot that you've 
but one feeling in your soul. Oh, don't look 
vacant and dazed," Rose derisively pursued; 
^^ don't look as if you didn't know what feeling I 
mean ! Renounce it — repudiate it, and I'll never 
touch her again ! " 

Jean gazed in sombre stupefaction. '*I know 
what feeliug you mean," she said at last, ^*and 
I'm incapable of meeting your condition. / 
*deny,' I * renounce,' I * repudiate,' as little as I 
hope, as I dream, or as I feel that I'm likely ever 

again even to utter 1 " Then she brought out 

in her baffled sadness, but with so little vulgarity 
of pride that she sounded, rather, a note of com- 
passion for a perversity so deep : *^ It's because of 
that that I want her I " 

*' Because you adore him — and she's his ? ** 

Jean faltered, but she was launched. *^ Because 
I adore him — and she's his." 

^ I want her for another reason," Rose declared. 



THB OTHEB H0T7SB 288 

^*I adored her poor mother — and she's hers. 
That's my ground, that's my love, that's my 
faith." She caught Eifie up again; she held her 
in two strong arms and dealt her a kiss that was 
a long consecration. ^^It's as your dear dead 
mother's, my own, my sweet, that — if it's time 
— I shall carry you to bed ! " She passed swiftly 
down the slope with her burden and took the turn 
which led her out of sight. Jean stood watching 
her till she disappeared and then waited till she 
had emerged for the usual minute on the rise in 
the middle of the bridge. She saw her stop again 
there, she saw her again, as if in the triumph — 
a great open-air insolence — of possession, press 
her face to the little girl's. Then they dipped 
together to the further end and were lost, and 
Jean, after taking a few vague steps on the lawn, 
paused, as if sick with the after taste of her en- 
counter, and turned to the nearest seat. It was 
close to Mrs. Beever's blighted tea-table, and 
when she had sunk into the chair she threw her 
arms upon this support and wearily dropped her 
head. 



XXVI 

At the end of some minutes, with the sense of 
being approached, she looked up and saw Paul 
Beever. Returning to the garden, he had stopped 
short at sight of her, and his arrival made her 
spring to her feet with the fear of having, in the 
belief that she was unobserved, shown him some- 
thing she had never shown. But as he bent upon 
her his kind, ugly face there came into her own 
the comfort of a general admission, the drop of 
all attempt at a superfine surface: they stood 
together without saying a word, and there passed 
between them something sad and clear, something 
that was in its essence a recognition of the great, 
pleasant oddity of their being drawn closer bj 
their rupture. They knew everything about each 
other now and, young and clean and good as they 
were, could meet not only without attenuations, 
but with a positive friendliness that was for each, 
from the other, a moral help. Paul had no need 

284 



THB OTHER HOUSE 285 

of speech to show Jean how he thanked her for 
ondentanding why he had not besieged her with 
a pressure more heroic, and she, on her side, could 
enter with the tread of a nurse in a sick-room 
into the spirit of that accommodation. They both, 
moreover, had been closeted with his mother — an 
experience on which they could, with some dumb 
humour, compare notes. The girl, finally, had 
now, to this dear boy she didn't love, something 
more to give than she had ever given ; and after 
a little she could see the dawn of suspicion of it 
in the eyes with which he searched her grave face. 

^^I knew Miss Armiger had come back here, 
and I thought I should find her,** he presently 
explained. 

^*She was here a few minutes ago — she has 
just left me,'* Jean said. 

^ To go in again ? " Paul appeared to wonder 
he had not met her on his way out. 

**To go over to Bounds." 

He continued to wonder. ** With Mr. Bream ? " 

"No— with his Uttte girl." 

Paul's surprise increased. *^She has taken her 
up?" 

Jean hesitated ; she uneasily laughed. " Up — 
up — up: away up in her arms I" 



286 THE OTHEB HOUSB 

Her companion was more literal. ^A young 
woman of Effie's age must be a weight ! '' 

*^I know what weight — I've carried her. Miss 
Armiger did it precisely to prevent that.** 

"To prevent your carrying her?** 

" To prevent my touching or, if possible, look- 
ing at her. She snatched her up and fled with 
her — to get her away from me.** 

"Why should she wish to do that?** Paul 
inquired. 

"I think you had better ask her directly.** 
Then Jean added: "As you say, she has taken 
her up. She's her occupation, from this time.'* 

"Why, suddenly, from this time?*' 

"Because of what has happened.*' 

"Between you and me?" 

"Yes — that's one of her reasons.'* 

"One of them?** laughed Paul. "She baa 
so many?'* 

"She tells me she has two." 

"Two? She speaks of it?" 

Jean saw, visibly, that she mystified him; bot 
she as visibly tried to let him see that this was 
partly because she spared him. "She speaks of 
it with perfect frankness.'* 

" Then what's her second reason ? " 



THB OTHEB HOUSE 287 

**That if I'm not engaged" — Jean hung fire, 
but she brought it out — **at least she herself is." 

"She herself?— instead of you?" 

Paul's blankness was so utter that his com- 
panion's sense of the comic was this time, and 
in spite of the cruelty involved in a correction, 
really touched. "To you? No, not to you, my 
dear Paul. To a gentleman I found with her 
here. To that Mr. Vidal," said Jean. 

Paul gasped. "Ton found that Mr. Vidal 
with her?" He looked bewilderedly about. 
"Where then i# he?" 

"He went over to Bounds." 

"And she went with him?" 

"No, she went after." 

Still Paul stood staring. " Where the dickens 
did he drop from?" 

"I haven't the least idea." 

The young man had a sudden light. "Why, 
I saw him with mammal He was here when 
I came off the river — he borrowed the boat." 

" But you didn't know it was he ? " 

"I never dreamed — and mamma never told 
me. 

Jean thought a moment. "She was afraid. 
You see Pm not." 



288  

Paul Beever more pitifullj wondered; he re- 
peated again the word she had left ringing in 
his ears. ^ She's * engaged * ? " 

**So she informed me." 

His little eyes rested on her with a stupefaction 
so candid as almost to amount to a challenge; 
then they moved away, far away, and he stood 
lost in what he felt. She came, tenderly, nearer 
to him, and they turned back to her; on which 
she saw they were filled with the tears that 
another failure she knew of had no power to 
draw to them. ^^It's awfully odd I" he said. 

*^IVe had to hurt you,*' she replied. **rm 
very sorry for you." 

''Oh, don't mind it I" Paul smiled. 

''These are things for you to hear of — 
straight." 

"From herf Ah, I don't want to do that I 
Tou see, of course, I sha'n't say anything." And 
he covered, for an instant, working it clumsily, 
one of his little eyes with the base of one of his 
big thumbs. 

Jean held out her hand to him. ^ Do you Iots 
her?" 

He took it, embarrassed, without meeting her 
look; then, suddenly, something of importance 



THE OTHBB HOITBX 289 

seemed to occur to him, and he replied with 
simple alertness: **I never mentioned it!" 

Dimly, but ever so kindly, Jean smiled. ^^ Be- 
cause you hadn't had your talk with m€ / " She 
kept hold of his hand. *^ Dear Paul, I must say 
it again — you're beautiful I" 

He stared, not, as yet, taking this approval 
home; then with the same prompt veracity, 
*^But she knows it, you know, all the samel" 
he exclaimed. 

Jean laughed as she released him ; but it kept 
DO gravity out of the tone in which she presently 
repeated: ^I'm sony for you." 

'' Oh, it's all right I May I light a cigarette ? " 
he asked. 

^ As many as you like. But I must leave you." 

He had struck a match, and at this he paused. 
*« Because Fm smoking?" 

**Dear, no. Because I must go over to see 
Effie." Facing wistfully to her little friend's 
quarter, Jean thought aloud. *^I always bid 
her good-night. I don't see why — on her birth- 
day, of all evenings — I should omit it." 

**Well, then, bid her good-night for me too." 
She was half-way down the slope; Paul went 
in the same direction, puffing his cigarette hard. 



290 tfilfi OTfiXB HOU8S 

Then, stopping shorti ^^Tony pats him up?** he 
abruptly asked. 

''Mr. Vidal? So it appears/* 

He gased a little, blowing his smoke, at this 
appearance. ''And she has gone over to see 
him?" 

"That may be a part of her errand.'* 

He hesitated again. "They can't have lost 
much time I" 

"Very little indeed." 

Jean went on again; but again he checked 
her with a question. "What has he^ what has 
the matter you speak of, to do with her cutting 

in ?" He paused as if in the presence of 

things painfully obscure. 

"To the interest others take in the child? 
Ah," said Jean, "if you feel as you do" — she 
hesitated — "don't ask me. Ask herT* 

She went her way, and, standing there in 
thought, he waited for her to come, after an 
interval, into sight on the curve of the bridge. 
Then as the minutes elapsed without her doing 
so, he lounged, heavy and blank, up again to 
where he had found her. Manning, while his 
back was turned, had arrived with one of her 
aids to carry off the tea-things; and from a 



THE OTHEB HOUSX 291 

distancef planted on the lawn, he bent on these 
evolutions an attention unnaturally fixed. The 
women marched and countermarchedf dismantling 
the table; he broodingly and vacantly watched 
them; then, as he lighted a fresh cigarette, he 
saw his mother come out of the house to give 
an eye to their work. She reached the spot 
and dropped a command or two; after which, 
joining him, she took in that her little company 
had dispersed. 

^*What has become of everyone?" 

Paul's replies were slow; but he gave her 
one now that was distinct. *^ After the talk 
on which I lately left you, I should think you 
would know pretty well what had become of me." 

She gave him a keen look ; her face softened. 
^What on earth's the matter with you?" 

He placidly smoked. ^^I've had my head 
punched." 

** Nonsense — for all you mind me/" She 
scanned him again. ^^Are you ill, Paul?" 

**rm all right," he answered philosophically. 

^Then kiss your old mammy." Solemnly, 
silently he obeyed her; but after he had done 
so she still held him before her eyes. She gave 
him a sharp pat. ^* You're worth them all I" 



292 THE OTHEB HOtJSB 

Paul made no acknowledgment of this tribute 
save to remark after an instant rather awkwardly : 
"I don't know where Tony is." 

^*I can do without Tony/' said his mother. 
"But Where's Tony's child?" 

"Miss Armiger has taken her home." 

"The clever thing!" — Mrs. Beever fairly ap> 
plauded the feat. " She was here when you came 
out?" 

"No, but Jean told me." 

"Jean was here?" 

"Yes; but she went over." 

" Over to Bounds — after what has happened?" 
Mrs. Beever looked at first incredulous; then 
she looked stem again. "What in the name 
of goodness possesses her?" 

"The wish to bid Effie good-night" 

Mrs. Beever was silent a moment. "I wish 
to Heaven she'd leave Effie alone!" 

"Aren't there different ways of looking at 
that?" Paul indulgently asked. 

" Plenty, no doubt — and only one decent one." 
The grossness of the girl's error seemed to loom 
larger. "I'm ashamed of her!" she declared. 

" Well, I'm not I " Paul quietly returned. 

"Oh, you — of course you excuse her!" In

the agitation that he had produced Mrs. Beever 
bounced across an interval that brought her into 
view of an object from which, as she stopped 
short at the sight of it« her emotion drew fresh 
sustenance. ^^Whj, there^s the boat I" 

'' Mr. Vidal has brought it back," said Paul. 

She faced round in surprise. ** You've seen 
him?'' 

^^No, but Jean told me." 

The ladj of Eastmead stared. *^ She has seen 
him? Then where on earth is he?" 

^^He's staying at Bounds," said Paul. 

His mother's wonderment deepened. ** He has 
got there already?" 

Paul smoked a little ; then he explained. " It's 
not veiy soon for Mr. Vidal — he puts things 
through. He's already engaged to her." 

Mystified, at sea, Mrs. Beever dropped upon 
a bench. *^ Engaged to Jean?" 

^* Engaged to Miss Armiger." 

She tossed her head with impatience. ** What 
news is that ? He was engaged to her five years 
ago 1 " 

*^ Well, then he is still. They've patched it up." 

Mrs. Beever was on her feet. *^ She has seen 
him?"

Tony Bream at this moment came rapidly down 
the lawn and had the effect of staying Paal*8 
answer. The young man gave a jerk to the 
stump of his cigarette and turned away with 
marked nervousness. 



xxvn 

The lady of Eastmead fronted her neighbour 
with a certain grimness. ^^She has seen him — 
they've patched it up." 

Breathless with curiosity, Tony yet made but a 
bite of her news. ** It's on again — it's all right? " 

^^It's whatever you like to call it. I only 
know what Paul tells me." 

Paul, at this, stopped in his slow retreat, wheel- 
ing about. **I only know what I had just now 
from Jean." 

Tony's expression, in the presence of his young 
friend's, dropped almost comically into the con- 
siderate. **0h, but I daresay it's so, old man. 
I was there when they met," he explained to 
Mrs. Beever, ^ and I saw for myself pretty well 
how it would go." 

^I confess I didn't," she replied. Then she 
added: **It must have gone with a jump I" 

^*With a jump, precisely — and the jump was 



296 THE OTHBB HOU8B 

hers!'* laughed Tony. ^^ All's well that ends 
well!" He was heated — he wiped his excited 
brow, and Mrs. Beever looked at him as if it 
struck her that she had helped him to more 
emotion than she wished him. ^ She's a most 
extraordinaiy girl," he went on, ^*and the effort 
she made there, all unprepared for it" — he 
nodded at the very spot of the exploit — '^was 
magnificent in its way, one of the finest things 
I've ever seen." His appreciation of the results 
of this effort seemed almost feverish, and his 
elation deepened so that he turned, rather 
blindly, to poor Paul. **Upon my honour she^s 
cleverer, she has more domestic resources, as one 
may say, than — I don't care whom I" 

^^ Oh, we all know how clever she is ! " Mrs. 
Beever impatientiy grunted. 

Tony's enthusiasm, none the less, overflowed; 
he was nervous for joy. *^I thought I did my- 
self, but she had a lot more to show me I " He 
addressed himself again to Paul. ^* She told you 
— with her coolness?" 

Paul was occupied with another cigarette; he 
emitted no sound, and his mother, with a glance 
at him, spoke for him. ^Didn't you hear bim 
say it was Jean who told him?" 



 297 

''Oh, Jean r* — Tony looked graver. ''She 
told Jean?" But his gaiety, at this image, 
quickly came back. *' That was charming of her ! " 

Mrs. Beever remained cold. ''Why on earth 
was it charming?" 

Tony, though he reddened, was pulled up but 
an instant — his spirits carried him on. "Oh, 
because there hasn't been much between them, 
and it was a pretty mark of confidence." He 
glanced at his watch. " They're in the house ? " 

"Not in mine — in yours." 

Tony looked surprised. "Rose and Vidal?" 

Paul spoke at last. "Jean also went over — 
went after them." 

Tony thought a moment. "'After them' — 
Jean? How long ago?" 

" About a quarter of an hour," said PauL 

Tony continued to wonder. " Aren't you mis- 
taken? They're not there now." 

"How do you know," asked Mrs. Beever, "if 
you've not been home?" 

"I have been home — I was there five minutes 
ago. 

"Then how did you get here ?" 

"By the long way. I took a fly. I went 
back to get a paper I had stupidly forgotten and 



298 THK OTHER HOUSE 

that I needed for a fellow with whom I had to 
talk. Our talk was a bore for the want of it, so 
I drove over there and got it, and, as he had his 
train to catch, I then overtook him at the sta- 
tion. I ran it close, but I saw him off ; and here 
I am." Tony shook hiB head. *^ There's no one 
at Bounds." 

Mrs. Beever looked at Paul. ^Then where's 
Effie?" 

''Effie's not here?" Tony asked. 

««Miss Armiger took her home," said Paul. 

**You saw them go?" 

^^ No, but Jean told me." 

"Then where's Miss Armiger?" Tony con- 
tinued. "And where's Jean herself?" 

"Where's Effie herself— that's the question," 
said Mrs. Beever. 

" No," Tony laughed, " the question's Where's 
Vidal? He's the fellow I want to catch. I 
asked him to stay with me, and he said he'd go 
over, and it was my finding just now he hadn't 
come over that made me drive on here from the 
station to pick him up." 

Mrs. Beever gave ear to this statement, but 
she gave nothing else. "Mr. Vidal can take 
care of himself; but if Effie's not at home, 



 299 

where is she?" She pressed her son. **Are 
you sure of what Jean said to you?" 

Paul bethought himself. ^^ Perfectly, mamma. 
She said Miss Armiger carried off the little girl." 

Tony appeared struck with this. ^*That*s 
exactly what Rose told me she meant to do. 
Then they're simply in the garden — they simply 
hadn't come in." 

^* They've been in gardens enough I" Mrs. 
Beever declared. **I should like to know the 
child's simply in bed." 

** So should I," said Tony with an irritation 
that was just perceptible; ^^but I none the less 
deprecate the time-honoured custom of a flurry 
— I may say indeed of a panic — whenever she's 
for a minute out of sight." He spoke almost as 
if Mrs. Beever were trying to spoil for him by 
the note of anxiety the pleasantness of the news 
about Rose. The next moment, however, he 
questioned Paul with an evident return of the 
sense that toward a young man to whom such 
a hope was lost it was a time for special tact. 
^^You, at any rate, dear boy, saw Jean go?" 

"Oh, yes — I saw Jean go." 

" And you understood from her that Rose and 
Effie went with Vidal?" 



800  

Paul consulted his memoiy. ^I think Mr. 
Vidal went first." 

Tony thought a moment. *' Thanks so much, 
old chap." Then with an exaggerated gaiety 
that might have struck his companions had it 
not been the sign of so much of his conversa- 
tion: ^* They're all a jolly party in the garden 
together. I'll go over." 

Mrs. Beever had been watching the bridge. 
**Here comes Rose — she'll tell us." 

Tony looked, but their friend had already 
dropped on the hither side, and he turned 
to Paul. '^You wouldn't object — a — to din- 
ing ?" 

''To meet Mr. Vidal?" Mis. Beever inter- 
posed. *^ Poor Paul," she laughed, '' you're be- 
tween two fires I You and your guest," she 
said to her neighbour, ''had better dine here." 

"Both fires at once?" — Tony smiled at her 
son. "Should you like that better?" 

Paul, where he stood, was lost in the act of 
watching for Rose. He shook his head absently. 
"I don't care a rap!" Then he turned away 
again, and his mother, addressing Tony, dropped 
her voice. 

"He won't show." 



 801 

^*Do you mean his feelings?" 

" I mean for either of us." 

Tonj observed him a moment. *^Poor lad, I'll 
bring him round I " After which, ^* Do you mind 
if I speak to her of it?" he abruptly inquired. 

"To Rose — of this news?" Mrs. Beever 
looked at him hard, and it led her to reply with 
severity: "Tony Bream, I don't know what to 
make of you I" She was apparently on the 
point of making something rather bad, but she 
now saw Rose at the bottom of the slope and 
straightway hailed her. " You took Effie home ? " 

Rose came quickly up. "Not II She isn't 
here?" 

"She's gone," said Mrs. Beever. "Where is 
she?" 

"I'm afraid I don't know. I gave her up." 
Paul had wheeled round at her first negation; 
Tony had not moved. Bright and handsome, 
but a little out of breath, she looked from one 
of her friends to the other. "You're sure she's 
not here?" Her surprise was fine. 

Mrs. Beever's, however, had greater freedom. 
" How can she be, when Jean says you took her 
away ? " 

Rose Armiger stared; she threw back her 



802 THE OTHEB HOUSB 

head. *^*Jean sajrs'?" She looked round her. 
"Where is *Jean'?" 

"She's nowhere about — she's not in the 
house." Mrs. Beever challenged the two men, 
echoing the question as if it were indeed perti- 
nent. "Where is the girl?" 

" She has gone to Bounds," said Tony. " She's 
not in my garden?" 

"She wasn't five minutes ago — Fye just come 
out of it." 

"Then what took you there?" asked Mis. 
Beever. 

"Mr. Vidal." Rose smUed at Tony: "^Tau 
know what I " She turned again to Mrs. Beever, 
looking her full in the face. " I've seen him. I 
went over with him." 

"Leaving Effie with Jean — precisely," said 
Tony, in his arranging way. 

"She came out — she begged so hard," Rose 
explained to Mrs. Beever. "So I gave in." 

"And yet Jean says the contrary?" this lady 
demanded in stupefaction of her son* 

Rose turned, incredulous, to PauL "She said 
to y<m — anything so false?" 

"My dear boy, you simply didn't under- 
stand!" Tony laughed. "Give me a cigarette/* 



THE OTHSB H0U8K 808 

Paurs eyes, contracted to the pin-points we 
have already seen them become in his moments 
of emotion, had been attached, while he smoked 
still harder, to Rose's face. He turned very red 
and, before answering her, held out his cigarette- 
case. ^^That was what I remember she said — 
that you had gone with EfEie to Bounds.** 

Rose stood wonderstruck. ^^When she had 
taken her from me herself ?" 

Mrs. Beever referred her to Paul. ** But she 
wasn't with Jean when he saw her I" 

Rose appealed to him. ^*Tou saw Miss Mar- 
tie alone?" 

^Oh yes, quite alone." Paul now was crim- 
son, and without visible sight. 

^^My dear boy," cried Tony, impatient, ^you 
simply don't remember." 

"Yes, Tony. I remember." 

Rose had turned grave — she gave Paul a 
sombre stare. "Then what on earth had she 
done with her?" 

"What she had done was evident: she had 
taken her home!" Tony declared with an air 
of incipient disgust. "They made a silly mys- 
tery of nothing." 

Rose gave him a quick, strained smile. "But 
if the child's not there ?" 



804 THB OTHBB H0U8S 

^'You just told OS yoaxself she isn't I" Mre. 
Beever reminded him. 

He hunched his shoulders as if there might 
be many explanations. ^^Then she's somewhere 
else. She's wherever Jean took her." 

^^But if Jean was here without her?" 

*^Then Jean, my dear lady, had come back." 

*^Come back to lie?" asked Mrs. Beever. 

Tony coloured at this, but he controlled him- 
self. ^Dearest Mrs. Beever, Jean doesn't lie." 

**Then somebody does I" Mrs. Beever roundly 
brought out. 

^ It's not you, Mr. Paul, I know ! " Rose de- 
clared, discomposed but still smiling. ^Was it 
you who saw her go over?" 

^Tes; she left me here." 

"How long ago?" 

Paul looked as if fifty persons had been watch- 
ing him. "Oh, not long I" 

Rose addressed herself to the trio. "Then 
why on earth haven't I met her? She must 
explain her astounding statement I " 

" You'll see that she'll explain it easily I " said 
Tony. 

"Ah, but, meanwhile, where's your daughter, 
don't you know? " Rose demanded with resentment 



THB OTHER HOUSB 805 

^I*m just going over to see." 

*^ Then please go I " she replied with a neryous 
laugh. She presented to the others, as a criti- 
cism of his inaction, a white, uneasy face. 

** I want first," said Tony, *^ to express to you 
my real joy. Please believe in it." 

She thought — she seemed to come back from 
a distance. **0h, you know?" Then to Paul: 
^She told you? It's a detail," she added impa- 
tiently. " The question " — she thought again — 
^ is the poor child." Once more she appealed to 
Paul. •^Will you go and see?" 

^Yes, go, boy." Tony patted his back. 

^*Go this moment," his mother put in. 

He none the less lingered long enough to 
offer Rose his blind face. **I want also to ex* 



press 

She took him up with a wonderful laugh. 
** Tour real joy, dear Mr. Paul ? " 

*^ Please believe in that too." And Paul, at 
an unwonted pace, took his way. 

**I believe in everything — I believe in every- 
one," Rose went on. "But I don't believe " 

She hesitated, then checked herself. "No mat- 
ter. Can you forgive me?" she asked of Mrs. 
Beever.

«For giving up the chUd?" The lady of 
Easttnead looked at her hard. ^^Nol" she said 
curtly, and, turning straight away, went and 
dropped into a seat, from which she watched 
the retreating figures of her two parlour-maids, 
who carried off between them a basket contain* 
ing the paraphernalia of tea. Rose, with a queer 
expression, but with her straight back to the 
painful past, quietly transferred her plea to 
Tony. ^^It was his coming — it made the dif* 
ference. It upset me." 

" Upset you ? You were splendid I " 

The light of what had happened was in her 
face as she considered him. ^ Tou are I ** she 
replied. Then she added: ^^But he*s finer than 
either of us I" 

^^I told you four years ago what he is. He*8 
all right." 

**Yes," said Rose— "he's all right And / 
am — now," she went on. "You've been good 
to me." She put out her baud. "Good-bye." 

"* Good-bye'? You're going?" 

"He takes me away." 

"But not to-night I" — Tony's native kindness, 
expressed in his inflection, felt that it could now 
risk almost all the forms he essentially liked. 



THB OTHXB HOUSE 807 

From the depth of Rose's eyes peeped a dis- 
tracted, ironic sense of this. But she said with all 
quietude : *' To-morrow early. I may not see you." 

''Don't be absurd!" laughed Tony. 

"Ah, well — if you will!" She stood a mo- 
ment looking down; then raising her eyes, 
^' Don't hold my hand so long," she abruptly 
said. '' Mrs. Beever, who has dismissed the ser- 
vants, is watching us." 

Tony had the appearance of having felt as if 
he had let it go ; but at this, after a glance at the 
person indicated, staring and smiling with a clear 
face, he retained his grasp of it. ''How in the 
world, with your back turned, can you see that?" 

"It's with my back turned that I see most. 
She's looking at us hard." 

" I don't care a hang ! " said Tony gayly. 

" Oh, I don't say it for myself I " But Rose 
withdrew her hand. 

Tony put both his own into his pockets. "I 
hope you'll let me say to you — very simply — 
that I believe youTl be very happy." 

" I shall be as happy as a woman can be who 
has abandoned her post." 

" Oh, your post ! " — Tony made a joke of that 
now. But he instantly added: "Tour post will 



808 THE OTHEB HO08S 

be to honour ns with your company at Bounds 
again ; which, as a married woman, you see, yon*ll 
be perfectly able to do." 

She smiled at him. ^^ How you arrange things ! *' 
Then with a musing headshake : ^^ We leave Eng- 
land." 

**How y<m arrange them I" Tony exclaimed. 
"He goes back to China?" 

" Very soon — he's doing so well." 

Tony hesitated. ^^ I hope he has made money." 

" A great deal. I should look better — shouldn't 
I ? — if he hadn't. But I show you enough how 
little I care how I look. I blow hot and cold; 
I'm all there — then I'm ofiF. No matter," she re* 
peated. In a moment she added : " I accept your 
hopes for my happiness. It will do, no doubt, as 

soon as I learn 1" Her voice dropped for 

impatience; she turned to the quarter of the 
approach from the other house. 

'' That Effie's all right? " Tony saw their mes- 
senger already in the shrubbery. "Here comes 
Paul to tell us." 

Mrs. Beever rejoined them as he spoke. "It 
wasn't Paul on the bridge. It was the Doctor — 
without his hat." 

"Without his hat?" Rose murmured 



TfiB OTHBB HOTTSB 809 

^^He has it in his hand/' Tony cheerfully as- 
serted as their good friend emerged from cover. 

But he hadn't it in his hand, and at sight of 
them on the top of the slope he stopped short, 
stopped long enough to give Rose time to call 
eagerly: ''Is Effie there?" 

It was long enough also to give them all time 
to see, across the space, that his air was disor- 
dered and his look at them strange ; but they had 
no sooner done so than he made a violent gesture 
— a motion to check the downward rush that he 
evidently felt his aspect would provoke. It was 
so imperative that, coming up, he was with them 
before they had moved, showing them splashed, 
wet clothes and a little hard white face that Wil- 
verley had never seen. ^ There has been an ac- 
cident" Neither had Wilverley, gathered into 
three pairs of ears, heard that voice. 

The first effect of these things was to hold it an 
instant while Tony cried: ''She's hurt?" 

"She's killed?" cried Mrs. Beever. 

" Stay where you are ! " was the Doctor's stern 
response. Tony had given a bound, but, caught 
by the arm, found himself jerked, flaming red, 
face to face with Rose, who had been grabbed as 
tightly by the wrist. The Doctor closed his eyes 



810 THB OTHBB HOUSE 

for a second with this effort of restraint, bat in 
the force he had put into it, which was not all 
of the hands, his captives submissively quivered. 
«« You're not to go I '' he declared — quite as if it 
were for their own good. 

"She's dead?" Tony panted. 

"Who's with her — who toasf^* cried Rose. 

"Paul's with her — by the water." 

"By the water?" Rose shrieked. 

"My child's drotrtted;" —Tony's shout was 
strange. 

The Doctor had been looking from one of them 
to the other ; then he looked at Mrs. Beever, who, 
instantly, admirably, with a strength quickly ac- 
knowledged by the mute motion of his expressive 
little chin toward her, had stilled herself into the 
appeal of a blanched, breathless wait. "May Z 
go?" sovereignly came from her. 

"Go. There's no one else," he said as she 
bounced down the bank. 

"No one else? Then where's that girl?" — 
Rose's question was fierce. She gave, as fiercely, 
to free herself, a great wrench of her arm, but the 
Doctor held her as if still to spare her what he 
himself had too dreadfully seen. He looked at 
Tony, who said with quick quietness — 



THS OTHBB H0XT8B 811 

^Ramage, have I lost my child?" 

"You'll see — be brave. Not yet — Fve told 
Paul. Be quiet ! " the Doctor repeated ; then his 
hand dropped on feeling that the movement he 
had meant to check in his friend was the vibration 
of a man stricken to weakness and sickened on 
the spot. Tony's face had turned black ; he was 
rooted to the ground ; he stared at Rose, to whom 
the Doctor said: " Who, Miss Armiger, was with 
her?*' 

All her lividness wondered. "When wa$ it 
?" 

"God knows I She was there — against the 
bridge." 

"Against the bridge — where I passed just 
now ? I saw nothing I " Rose jerked, while Tony 
dumbly closed his eyes. 

" I came over because she wasn't at the house, 
and — from the bank — there she was. I reached 
her — with the boat, with a push. She might 
have been half an hour " 

" It was half an hour ago she took her I " Rose 
broke in. "She's not there?" 

The Doctor looked at her hard. " Of whom do 
you speak?" 

" Why, of Miss Martle — whose hands are never

off her." Rose's mask was the mask of Medoaa. 
^^ What has become of Miss Martle ? '* 

Dr. Ramage tamed with the qaestion to Tony, 
whose eyes, open now, were half out of his head. 
''What has become of her?" 

''She's not there?" Tony articulated. 

"There's no one there." 

" Not Dennis ? " sprang bewilderedly from Rose. 

The Doctor stared. " Mr. Vidal ? No, thank 
God — only Paul." Then pressing Tony : " Miss 
Martle was with her? " 

Tony's eyes rolled over all space. " No — not 
Miss Martle." 

" But somebody was I " Rose clamoured. ** She 
wasn't alone I" 

Tony fixed her an instant. ** Not Miss Martle,'* 
he repeated. 

"But who then? And where is she now?" 

"It's positive she's not here?" the Doctor 
asked "^f Rose. 

" Positive — Mrs. Bee ver knew. Where is she 7 " 
Rose rang out 

"Where in the name ?" passed, as with 

the dawn of a deeper honor, from their companion 
to Tony. 

Tony's eyes sounded Rose's, and hers biased

back. His silence was an anguish, his face a 
convulsion. ^^ It isn't half an hour/' he at last 
brought out. 

^^ Since it happened ? " The Doctor blinked at 
his sudden knowledge. ^ Then when ? " 

Tony looked at him straight. *^When I was 
there." 

*^And when was that?" 

*^ After I called for you." 

" To leave word for me to go ? " The Doctor 
set his face. *^But you weren't going home 
then." 

^*I did go — I had a reason. Tou know it," 
Tony said to Rose* 

"When you went for your paper?" She 
thought ''But Effie wasn't there then." 

''Why not? She was there, but Miss Martle 
wasn't with her." 

"Then, in God's name, who was?" cried the 
Doctor. ^ 

" I was," said Tony. 

Rose gave the inarticulate cry of a person who 
has been holding her breath, and the Doctor an 
equally loud, but more stupefied " Tou ? " 

Tony fixed upon Rose a gaze that seemed to 
count her respirations. "I was with her," he 



814  

repeated; *^and I was with ber alone. And 
what was done — I did." He paused while they 
both gasped; then he looked at the Doctor. 
^Now you know.*' They continued to gasp; 
his confession was a blinding glare, in the shock 
of which the Doctor staggered back from Rose 
and she fell away with a liberated spring. ^ God 
forgive me!" howled Tony — he broke now into 
a storm of sobs. He dropped upon a bench with 
his wretched face in his hands, whUe Rose, with 
a passionate wail, threw herself, appalled, on 
the grass, and their companion, in a colder dis- 
may, looked from one prostrate figure to the other.

The greatest of the parlour-maids came from 
the hall into the drawing-room at Eastmead — 
the high, square temple of mahogany and tapes- 
try in which, the last few years, Mrs. Beever 
had spent much time in rejoicing that she had 
never set up new gods. She had left it, from 
the first, as it was — full of the old things that, 
on succeeding to her husband's mother, she had 
been obliged, as a young woman of that period, 
to accept as dolefully different from the things 
thought beautiful by other young women whose 
views of drawing-rooms, all about her, had also 
been intensified by marriage. She had not un» 
assistedly discovered the beauty of her heritage, 
and she had not from any such subtle suspicion 
kept her hands off it. She had never in her 
life taken any course with regard to any object 
for reasons that had so little to do with her 
duty. Everything in her house stood, at an 

317 



318  

angle of its own, on the solid rock of the disci- 
pline it had cost her. She had therefore lived 
with mere drj wistfalness through the age of 
rosewood, and had been rewarded bj finding 
that, like those who sit still in runaway vehicles, 
she was the only person not thrown out. Her 
mahogany had never moved, but the way people 
talked about it had, and the people who talked 
were now eager to sit down with her on every- 
thing that both she and they had anciently 
thought plainest and poorest. It was Jean above 
all who had opened her eyes — opened them in 
particular to the great winedark doors, polished 
and silver-hinged, with which the lady of East- 
mead, arriving at the depressed formula that 
they were ^'gloomy," had for thirty years, pm- 
dently, on the whole, as she considered, shut 
out the question of taste. One of these doors 
Manning now softly closed, standing, however, 
with her hand on the knob and looking across 
as if, in the stillness, to listen at another whioh 
exactly balanced with it on the opposite side of 
the room. The light of the long day had not 
wholly faded, but what remained of it was the 
glow of the western sky, which showed through 
the wide, high window that was still open to 



 319 

the garden. The sensible hush in which Man- 
ning waited was broken after a moment by a 
movement, ever so gentle, of the other door. 
Mrs. Beever put her head out of the next 
room; then, seeing her servant, closed the door 
with precaations and came forward. Her face, 
hard bat overchaiged, had already asked a qaes- 
tion. 

^^Tes, Ma'am — Mr. Vidal. I showed him, as 
you told me, into the library.'* 

Mrs. Beever thought. **It may be wanted. 
I'll see him here." But she checked the woman's 
retreat. **Mr. Beever^s in his room?" 

"No, Ma'am — he went out." 

"But a minute ago?" 

" Longer, Ma'am. After he had carried in " 

Mrs. Beever stayed the word on Manning's 
lips and quickly supplied her own. "The poor 
sick little girl — yes. He went to Mr. Bream?" 

"No, Ma'am — the other way." 

Mrs. Beever thought afresh. " But Miss Armi- 
ger's in?" 

" Oh, yes — in her room." 

"She went straight?" 

Manning, on her side, reflected. " Tes, Ma'am. 
She always goes straight." 



820  

^^Not always/' said Mrs. Beever. *^Bat 8lie*« 
quiet there?" 

•*Very quiet?" 

'' Then call Mr. Vidal." While Manning obevad 
she turned to the window and stared at the gath- 
ering dusk. Then the door that had been left 
open closed again, and she faced aboat to Dennis 
Vidal. 

^^ Something dreadful has happened?" he in- 
stantly asked. 

^^ Something dreadful has happened. Toa^ve 
come from Bounds?" 

*^ As fast as I could run. I saw Dr. Ramage.** 

""He's with Tony? Then what did he tell 
you?" 

^^That I must come straight here." 

"Nothing else?" 

'' That you would tell me," Vidal said. ''I saw 
the shock in his face." 

"But you didn't ask?" 

"Nothing. Here I am." 

" Here you are, thank God ! " Mrs. Beever gave 
a muffled moan. 

She was going on, but, eagerly, he was before 
her. " Can I help you ? " 

"Tea — if there u help. Tou can do so firet 



 321 

bj not asking me a question till I have put those 
I wish to jourself." 

^ Put them — put them I " he said impatientlj. 

At his peremptory note she quivered, showing 
him she was in the state in which every sound 
startles. She locked her lips and closed her eyes 
an instant; she held herself together with an 
effort. ^^I'm in great trouble, and I venture to 
believe that if you came back to me to-day it 
was because " 

He took her up shorter than before. ** Because 
I thought of you as a friend? For God's sake, 
think of me as one!" 

She pressed to her lips, while she looked at 
him, the small tight knot into which her nerves 
had crumpled her pocket-handkerchief. She had 
no tears — only a visible terror. ^^Tve never 
appealed to one,'* she replied, ^*as I shall appeal 
to you now. Effie Bream is dead." Then, as 
instant horror was in his eyes: *^She was found 
in the water." 

^^The water?" Dennis gasped. 

^^ Under the bridge — at the other side. She 
had been caught, she was held, in the slow cur- 
rent, by some obstruction, and by the pier. Don't 
ask me hato — when I arrived by the mercy of 



822 THE OTHBB H0U8B 

Heaven, she had been brought to the bank. Bat 
she was gone/' With a movement of the head 
toward the room she had quitted, **We carried 
her back here," she went on. Vidal's face, which 
was terrible in the intensity of its sudden vision, 
struck her apparently as, for an instant, an echo, 
wild but interrogative, of what she had last said ; 
so she explained quickly: *^To think — to get 
more time." He turned straight away from her ; 
he went, as she had done, to the window and, 
with his back presented, stood looking out in 
the mere rigour of dismay. 

She was silent long enough to show a respect 
for the particular consternation that her manner 
of watching him betrayed her impression of hav- 
ing stirred ; then she pursued : ** How long were 
you at Bounds with Rose?" 

Vidal turned round without meeting her eyes 
or, at first, understanding her question. **At 
Bounds?" 

*^When, on your joining her, she went over 
with you," 

He thought a moment. ^She didn't go over 
with me. I went alone — after the child came 
out." 

^^ You were there when Manning brought her ? ** 



THE OTHER H0TJ8B 828 

— Mrs. BeeTer wondeied. *^ Manning didn't tell 
me* 

^ I f oand Rose on the lawn — with Mr. Bream 

— when I brought back your boat. He left us 
together — after inviting me to Bounds — and then 
the little girl arrived. Rose let me hold her, and 
I was with them till Miss Martle appeared. Then 
I — rather uncivilly — went off.** 

^* Tou went without Rose ? " Mrs. Beever asked. 

^* Tes — I left her with the little girl and Miss 
Martle." The vivid effect of this statement made 
him add : ^ Was it your impression I didn't ? ** 

His companion, before answering him, dropped 
into a seat and stared up at him ; after which she 
brought out: ^^Fll tell you later. Tou left 
them/' she demanded, ^^in the garden with the 
chUd?" 

*^In the garden with the child." 

''Then you hadn't taken her?" 

Dennis had for some seconds a failure either of 
memory or of courage ; but, whichever it was, he 
completely overcame it. ''By no means. She 
was in Rose's arms." 

Mrs. Beever, at this image, attached her eyes to 
the carpet; after which, raising them again, she 
continued: "Tou went to Bounds?" 



824 THE OTHBB HOITSS 

^^ No — I turned off short. I w(U going, but if 
I had a great deal to think of," he explained, 
^ after I had learned from you she was here, the 
quantity wasn't, of course, diminished by oar 
personal encounter.'* He hesitated. ^ I had seen 
her with Aim." 

^ Well ? *' said Mrs. Beever as he paused again. 

*^I asked you if she was in love with him.'' 

^^And I bade you find out for younelL" 

^^IVe found out,'' Dennis said. 

''Well?" Mrs. Beever repeated. 

It was evidently, even in this tighter tension, 
something of an ease to all his soreness to tell her. 
''I've never seen anything like it — and there's 
not much I've not seen." 

" That's exactly what the Doctor says I " 

Dennis stared, but after a moment, " And does 
the Doctor say Mr. Bream cares?" he artlessly 
inquired. 

"Not a farthing." 

" Not a farthing. I'm bound to say — I could 
see it for myself," he declared, " that he has be* 
haved very well." Mrs. Beever, at this, turning 
in torment on her seat, gave a smothered wail 
which pulled him up so that he went on in sQr> 
prise: "Don't you think that?" 



THB OTHSB U0XT8S 325 

^ril tell 70U later,'* she answered. ^In the 
presence of this misery I don't judge him/' 

** No more do I. Bat what I was going to say 
was that, all the same, the way he has with a 
woman — the way he had with her there, and his 
damned good looks and his great happiness " 

^^His great happiness? Ood help him I" Mrs. 
Beever broke out, springing up again in her emo- 
tion. She stood before him with pleading hands. 
** Where were you then ? " 

*^ After I left the garden? I was upset, I was 
dissatisfied — I didn't go over. I lighted a cigar ; 
I passed out of the gate by your little closed 
pavilion and kept on by the river." 

^By the river?" — Mrs. Beever was blank. 
"Then why didn't you see ?" 

" What happened to the child ? Because, if it 
happened near the bridge, I had left the bridge 
behind." 

**But you were in sight " 

"For five minutes," Dennis said. "I was in 
sight perhaps even for ten. I strolled there, 
I turned things over, I watched the stream, 
and, finally — just at the sharp bend — I sat a 
little on the stile beyond that smart new boat- 
house." 



826 THB OTHEB HOUSS 

** It*8 a horrid thing.'* Mrs. Beever considered. 
*^ But yoa see the bridge from the boat-hooae/* 

Dennis hesitated. *^ Tes — it's a good way, but 
you've a glimpse." 

" Which showed you nothing at aU? " 

*^ ^ Nothing at all' ? " — his echo of the questioti 
was interrogative, and it carried him uneasily to 
the window, where he again, for a little, stared 
out. The pink of the sky had faded, and dusk 
had begun in the room. At last he faced about. 
^*No — I saw something. But I'll not tell you 
what it was, please, till I've myself asked yoa a 
thing or two." 

Mrs. Beever was silent at this ; they stood fiaoe 
to face in the twilight. Then she slowly exhaled 
a part of her anguish. ^ I think youll be a help.** 

^^How much of one," he bitterly demanded, 
^* shall I be to myself?" But he continued before 
she could meet the question. ^^I went back to 
the bridge, and as I approached it Miss Martle 
came down to it from your garden." 

Mrs. Beever grabbed his arm. ^^ Without the 
child ? " He was silent so long that she repeated 
it: "Without the chUd?" 

He finally spoke. " Without the chUd." 

She looked at him as she showed that she felt 



THE OTHEB HOUSS 827 

she had never looked at any man. ^^On jour 
sacred honour I** 

"On my sacred honour." 

She closed her eyes as she had closed them at 
the heginning of their talk, and the same defeated 
spasm passed oyer her face. "Ton are a help/' 
she said. 

" Well,*' Dennis replied straightforwardly, " if 
it's being one to let you know that she was with 
me from that moment " 

Breathless, she caught him up. " With yauf — 
till when?" 

" Till just now, when we again separated at the 
gatehouse: I to go over to Bounds, as I had 
promised Mr. Bream, and Miss Martle " 

Again she snatched the words from him. " To 
come straight in ? Oh, glory be to God I " 

Dennis showed some bewilderment. " She did 
come ?" 

" Mercy, yes — to meet this horror. She's with 
Effie." She returned to it, to have it again. " She 
was with you ? " 

"A quarter of an hour — perhaps more." At 
this Mrs. Beever dropped upon her sofa again and 
gave herself to the tears that had not sooner come. 
She sobbed softly, controlling them, and Dennis 



828 THE OTHER HOITSS 

watched her with hard, haggard pity ; after whieh 
he said : ** As soon as I saw her I spoke to her — 
I felt that I wanted her.*' 

**Tou wanted her?" — in the clearer mediam 
through which Mrs. Beever now could look up 
there were still obscurities. 

He hesitated. ^* For what she might say to me. 
I told 70U, when we spoke of Rose after mj 
arrival, that I had not come to watch her. Bat 
while I was with them '' — he jerked his head at 
the garden — ^* something took place." 

Mrs. Beever rose again. **I know what took 
place." 

He seemed struck. ^^Tou know it?" 

''She told Jean." 

Dennis stared. ''I think not." 

''Jean didn't speak of it to you?" 

"Not a word." 

"She spoke of it to Paul," said Mrs. Beever. 
Then, to be more specific : " I mean your engage* 
ment." 

Dennis was mute ; but at last, in the gathered 
gloom, his voice was stranger than his silence. 
"My engagement?" 

" Didn't you, on the spot, induce her to renew 
it?" 



 829 

Again, for some time, he was damb* *^ Has she 
said so ? " he then asked. 

"To everyone.'* 

Once more he waited. *^I should like to see 
her." 

" Here she is.** 

The door from the hall had opened as he spoke : 
Rose Armiger stood there. She addressed him 
straight, and as if she had not seen Mrs. Beever. 
" I knew you'd be here — I must see you.** 

Mrs. Beever passed quickly to the side of the 
room at which she had entered, where her fifty 
years of order abruptly came out to Dennis. 
"Will you have lights?** 

It was Rose who replied. "No lights, thanks.** 
But she stayed her hostess. "May I see her?** 

Mrs. Beever fixed a look through the dusk. 
" No I *' And she slipped away. 



Rose had come for a purpose, Dennis saw, to 
which she would make but a bound, and she 
seemed in fact to take the spring as she instantly 
broke out: ^^For what did you come back to 
me? — for what did you come back?" She 
approached him quickly, but he made, more 
quickly, a move that gained him space and that 
might well have been the result of two sharp 
impressions: one of these the sense that in a 
single hour she had so altered as to be ugly, with- 
out a trace of the charm that had haunted him; 
and the other the sense that, thus ravaged and dis- 
figured, wrecked in the gust that had come and 
gone, she expected of him something that she had 
never expected. A monstrous reality flared up 
in their relation, the perception of which was a 
shock that he was conscious for the moment of 
betraying that he feared, finding no words to 
answer her and showing her across the room, 

330 



THE OTHBB H0U8B 381 

while she repeated her question, a face blanched 
bj the change in her own. *^ For what did jou 
come back to me? — for what did you come 
back?*' 

He gaped at her; then, as if there were help 
for him in the simple fact that, on his own side, 
he could immediately recall, he stammered out: 
^ To you — to you ? I hadn't the slightest notion 
you were here I" 

^ Didn't you come to see where I was ? Didn't 
you come absolutely and publicly far me ? " He 
jerked round again to the window with the vaguoi 
wild gesture of a man in horrible pain, and she 
went on without vehemence, but with clear, deep 
intensity: **It was exactly when you found I 
was here that you did come back. Tou had a 
perfect chance, on learning it, not to show ; but 
you didn't take the chance, you quickly put it 
aside. Tou reflected, you decided, you insisted 
we should meet." Her voice, as if in harmony 
with the power of her plea, dropped to a vibration 
more mu£Bed, a soft but inexorable pressure. ^ I 
hadn't called you, I hadn't troubled you, I left 
you as perfectly alone as I've been alone. It 
was your own passion and your own act — 
you've dropped upon me, you've overwhelmed 



832 THE OTHEB HOUSB 

me. TouVe overwhelmed me, I say, because I 
speak from the depths of my surrender. But 7011 
didn't do it, I imagine, to be cruel, and if 700 
didn't do it to be cruel you did it to take what it 
would give you.*' Gradually, as she talked^ be 
faced round again ; she stood there supported by 
the high back of a chair, either side of which ahe 
held tight. ^* Tou know what I am, if any man 
has known, and it's to the thing I am — whatever 
that is — you've come back at last from so far. 
It*s the thing I am — whatever that is — I now 
count on you to stand by." 

^ Whatever that is ? " — Dennis moumfoUy 
marvelled. '*I feel, on the contrary, that Fve 
never, never known!" 

'^It's before anything, then, a woman who has 
such a need as no woman has ever had." Then 
she eagerly added: **Why on earth did you 
descend on me if you hadn't need of fii€/" 

Dennis took, for an instant, quite as if she were 
not there, several turns in the wide place ; mov- 
ing in the dumb distress of a man confronted with 
the greatest danger of his life and obliged, while 
precious minutes lapse, to snatch at a way of 
safety. His whole air was an instinctive retreat 
from being carried by assault, and he had the 



 888 

effect both of keeping far from her and of revoly- 
ing blindly round her. At last, in his hesitation, 
he pulled up before her. **What makes, all of 
a sudden, the tremendous need you speak of? 
Didn't you remind me but an hour ago of how 
remarkably low, at our last meeting, it had 
dropped?" 

Rose's eyes, in the dimness, widened with their 
wonder. ^ Ton can speak to me in harshness of 
what I did an hour ago ? You can taunt me with 
an act of penance that might have moved you — 
that did move you? Does it mean," she con- 
tinued, ^'that youVe none the less chosen — as I 
told you to choose; embraced the alternative 
that seems to you most worthy of your courage ? 
Did I only stoop, in my deep contrition, to make 
it easier for you to knock me down ? I gave you 
your chance to refuse me, and what you've come 
back for, then, will have been only, most hand- 
somely, to take it. In that case you did injustice 
there to the question of your revenge. What 
fault have you to find with anything so splen- 
did?" 

Dennis had listened with his eyes averted, and 
he met her strained glare as if he had not heard, 
bringing out his previous words with a harder 



884 THE OTHBB HOUSE 

iteration: *'What makes your tremendous need^ 
what makes your tremendous need?" He spoke 
as if that were the one way of safety. **I don** 
in the least see why it should have taken such - 
jump. You must do justice, even after your a* 
of this afternoon — a demonstration far great- 
than any I dreamed of asking of you — r- 
must do justice to my absolute necessity for »* 
ing everything clear. I didn't there, in the l' 
den, see anything clear at all — I was only star 
and wonder-struck and puzzled. Certainly I -. 
touched, as you say — I was so touched tha 
particularly suffered. But I couldn't prett 
was satisfied or gratified, or even that I wa^ 
ticularly convinced. You often failed, of • 
know, to give me what I really wanted 
you, and yet it never prevented the sucl 
your effect on — what shall I call it?" 
stopped short. ^^On God knows what 
obscurer part of me. I'm not such a brutv 
say," he quickly went on, ^that that eff^ 
not produced this afternoon " 

"You confine yourself to saying," Ro> 
rupted, "that it's not produced in out 
situation I " 

He stared, through the thicker du^' 



THB OTHEB HOUBB 885 

which, ^^I don't understand you!" he dropped. 
^'I do say," he declared, ^Hhat whatever your 
success to-day may be admitted to have consisted 
of, I didn't at least then make the admission. I 
didn't at that moment understand you any more 
than I do now ; and I don't think I said anything 
to lead you to suppose I did. I showed you 
simply that I was bewildered, and I couldn't 
have shown it more than by the abrupt way I 
left you. I don't recognise that I'm committed to 
anything that deprives me of the right of asking 
you {or a little more light." 

«* Do you recognise by chance," Rose returned, 
"the honible blow " 

"That has fallen on all this wretched place? 
I'm unutterably shocked by it. But where does 
it come into our relations?" 

Rose smiled in exquisite pity, which had the 
air, however, of being more especially for herself. 
" Tou say you were painfully affected ; but you 
really invite me to go further still. Haven't I put 
the dots on all the horrid I's? Haven't I dragged 
myself through the dust of enough confessions ? " 

Dennis slowly and grimly shook his bead; he 
doggedly clung to his real refuge. "I don't 
understand you — I don't understand you/' 



886 THE OTHER HOITSB 

Rose, at this, overcame her diflSdence. '^It 
would be inexpressibly horrible to me to appear 
to be free to profit by Mr. Bream*8 misfortune.** 

Dennis thought a moment. ^*To appear, 700 
mean, to have an interest in the fact that the 
death of his daughter leaves him at liberlj to 
invite you to become his wife?** 

^^You express it to admiration.*' 

He discernibly wondered. ^* But why should 
you be in danger of that torment to your delicacy 
if Mr. Bream has the best of reasons for doing 
nothing to contribute to it?** 

^^The best of Mr. Bream*8 reasons,'' Rose re- 
turned, *^won*t be nearly so good as the worst 
of mine I *' 

^^That of your making a match with someone 
else? I see,** her companion said. ^^ That's the 
precaution I*m to have the privilege of putting in 
your power.'* 

She gave the strangest of smiles ; the whites of 
her excited eyes shimmered in the gloom. ^ Toa 
make my position perfect** 

Dennis hesitated. ^'And what do I make my 
own?" 

** Exactly the one you came to take. You have 
taken it by your startling presence ; you're up to 



THB OTHBB HOUSE 887 

your neck in it, and there's nothing that will be- 
come you 80 as to wear it bravely and gallantly. 
If you don't like it," Rose added, ^' you should 
have thought of that before." 

^ You like it so much on your side," Dennis 
returned, ^that you appear to have engaged in 
measures to create it even before the argument 
for it had acquired the force that you give such 
a fine account of." 

^^ Do you mean by giving it out as a fact ? It 
was never too soon to give it out: the right 
moment was the moment you were there. Your 
arrival changed everything ; it gave me on the spot 
my advantage ; it precipitated my grasp of it.'* 

Vidal's expression was like a thing battered 
dead, and lus voice was a sound that matched it. 
** You call your grasp your announcement ? '* 

She threw back her head. ** My announcement 
ha$ reached you? Then you know IVe cut off 
your retreat." Again he turned away from her ; 
he flung himself on the sofa on which, shortly 
before, Mrs. Beever had sunk down to sob, and, 
as if with the need to hold on to something, 
buried his face in one of the hard square cushions. 
She came a little nearer to him ; she went on with 
her low lucidity. ^*So you can't abandon me — 



838 THS OTHER fioirsB 

you can*t. You came to me through doubts — yoo 
spoke to me through fears. You're mine I " 

She left him to turn this over ; she moTed off 
and approached the door at which Mrs. BeeTer 
had g^ne out, standing there in a rigour of atten- 
tion till, in the sileuccy he at last raised his head. 
*^What is it then you look to me to do?** 

She came away from the door. ^ Simply to see 
me through." 

He was on his feet again. ^^ Through what, in 
the name of horror?'* 

*^ Through everything. If I count on you, it*s 
to support me — if I say things, it's for y^M to ssj 
them." 

*'Even when they're black lies?" Dennis 
asked. 

Her retort was immediate — *^ What need should 
I have of you if they were white ones ? " He 
unable to tell her, only meeting her mettle 
his stupor, and she continued, with the lightest 
ring of reproach in her quiet pain : *^ I thank yoa 
for giving that name to my weak boast that yoa 
admire me." 

He had a sense of comparative idiocy. **Do 
you expect me — on that admiration — to many 
you?" 



THB OTHEB HOUSE 889 

^ Bless your innocent heart, no ! — for what do 
you take me? I expect you simply to make 
people believe that you mean to." 

** And how long will they believe it if I don't?'' 

*' Ob, if it should come to that," said Rose, 
^you can easily make them believe that you 
have!^* She took a step so rapid that it was 
almost a spring ; she had him now and, with her 
hands on his shoulders, she held him fast **So 
you see, after all, dearest, how little I ask I " 

He submitted, with no movement but to close 
his eyes before the new-bom dread of her caress. 
Tet he took the caress when it came — the dire 
confession of her hard embrace, the long entreaty 
of her icy kiss. He might still have been a 
creature trapped in steel; after she had let him 
go he still stood at a loss how to turn. There 
was something, however, that he presently opened 
his eyes to try. ** That you went over with me — 
that's what you wish me to say?" 

'«Over to Bounds? Is that what I said? I 
can't think." But she thought all the same. 
'^ Thank you for fixing it. If it's that, stick to it I " 

**And to our having left the child with Miss 
MarUe?" 

This brought her up a moment. *^ Don't ask 



840 THE OTHER HOtTftB 

me — simply meet the case as it comes. I give 
you/' she added in a marvellous manner, ^a 
perfectly free hand!" 

««You*re very liberal/* said Dennis, ^bat I 
think you simplify too much/* 

^* I can hardly do that if to simplify is to leaye 
it to your honour. It*s the beauty of my position 
that yott*re believed.** 

^'That, then, gives me a certain confidence in 
telling you that Miss Martle was the whole time 
with me.** 

Rose stared. '*0f what time do you speak?** 

** The time after you had gone over to Bounds 
with Eiffie." 

Rose thought again. *^ Where was she with 
you?** 

^*By the river, on this side.** 

''On this side? You didn*t go to Bounds?** 

''Not when I left you for the purpose. I 
obeyed an impulse that made me do just tlie 
opposite. You see,** said Dennis, "that there*s 
a flaw in my honour I You had filled my cup too 
full — I couldn't carry it straight I kept by the 
stream — I took a walk.** 

Rose gave a low, vague sound. "But Miss 
Martle and I were there together.** 



 841 

**Yoa were together till yoa separated. On 
my return to the bridge I met her/' 

Rose hesitated. ^ Where was she going?'* 

^Over to Bounds — but I prevented her." 

*'Tou mean she joined you?" 

^*In the kindest manner — for another turn. 
I took her the same way again." 

Once more Rose thought. *^But if she was 
going over, why in the world should she have 
let you ? " 

Dennis considered. ^I think she pitied me." 

^Because she spoke to you of me?" 

*^No, because she didn't But I spoke to her 
of yott," said Dennis. 

"And what did you say?" 

He hung fire a moment. " That a short time 
before I saw you cross to Bounds?" 

Rose slowly sat down. "You saw me?" 

" On the bridge, distinctly. With the child in 
your arms." 

"Where were you then?" 

"Far up the stream — beyond your observation." 

She looked at him fixedly, her hands locked 
together between her knees. "You were watch- 
ing me?" Ghostly and ominous, in the darker 
room, was all their confronted estrangement. 



842  

Dennis waited as if he had a choice of answen ; 
but at last he simply said: ^'I saw no more.** 

His companion as slowly rose again and moved 
to the window, beyond which the garden had now 
grown vague. She stood before it awhile^ then, 
without coming away, turned her back to it, so 
that he saw her handsome head, with the face 
obscure, against the evening sky. ^ Shall I teU 
you who did it?** she asked. 

Dennis Vidal faltered. ^^ If you feel that you're 
prepared.** 

'* Tve been preparing. I see it*s best.** Again, 
however, she was silent. 

This lasted so long that Dennis finally spoke. 
"Who did it?" 

"Tony Bream — to marry Jean.*' 

A loud sound leaped from him, which was 
thrown back by the sudden opening of the door 
from the hall and a consequent gush of light 
Manning marched in with a high lamp, and 
Doctor Ramage stood on the threshold. 



Ths Doctor remained at the door while the 
maid put down her lamp, and he checked her 
as she proceeded to the blinds and the other 
duties of the moment. 

^^ Leave the windows, please ; it*s warm. That 
will do — thanks.'' He closed the door on her 
extinguished presence, and he held it a little, 
mutely, with observing eyes, in that of Dennis 
and Rose. 

«*Do you want met^* the latter promptly 
asked, in the tone, as he liked, of readiness 
either to meet him or to withdraw. She seemed 
to imply that at such an hour there was no 
knowing what anyone might want Vidal*s eyes 
were on her as well as the Doctor's, and if the 
lamp now lighted her consciousness of looking 
horrible she could at least support herself with 
the sight of the crude embarrassment of the 
others. 



844  

The Doctor, resorting to his inveterate pimctice 
when confronted with a question, consulted his 
watch. '^ I came in for Mr. Vidal, but I shall be 
glad of a word with you after IVe seen him. 
I must ask you, therefore ** — and he nodded at 
the third door of the room — *^ kindly to pass 
into the library.** 

Rose, without haste or delay, reached the point 
he indicated. '^You wish me to wait here?** 

**If you'll be so good." 

«« While you talk with himf' 

"WhUe I talk with *him.*" 

Her eyes held Vidal*s a minute. ^FU wait.** 
And she passed out. 

The Doctor immediately attacked him. **I 
must appeal to you for a fraction of your time. 
IWe seen Mrs. Beever." 

Dennis hesitated. ^^IVe done the same." 

^*It*s because she has told me of your talk 
that I mention it. She sends you a message." 

^*A message?" Dennis looked as if it were 
open to him to question such indireotnesi. 
''Where then is she?" 

''She's with that distracted girl." 

"Miss Martle?" Dennis hesitated. "Mias 
Martle so greatly feels the shock?" 



 345 

"* Feels' it, my dear sir?" the Doctor cried. 
^^She has been made so pitifully ill by it that 
there's no saying just what turn her condition 
may take, and that she calls for so much of my 
attention as to force me to plead, with you, that 
excuse for my brevity. Mrs. Beever," he rap- 
idly pursued, ^^ requests you to regard this hur- 
ried inquiry as the sequel to what you were so 
good as to say to her." 

Dennis thought a moment; his face had 
changed as if by the action of Rose's disappear^ 
ance and the instinctive revival, in a different 
relation, of the long, stiff habit of business, the 
art of treating affairs and meeting men. This 
was the art of not being surprised, and, with 
his emotion now controlled, he was discemibly 
on his guard. *^Vm afraid," he replied, *^that 
what I said to Mrs. Beever was a very small 
matter." 

^^She doesn't think it at all a small matter 
to have said you'd help her. You can do so — 
in the cruel demands our catastrophe makes of 
her — by considering that I represent her. It's 
in her name, therefore, that I ask you if you're 
engaged to be married to Miss Armiger." 

Dennis Vidal just visibly faltered; but it 



346 THB OTHEB HOU8X 

might have been quite as much at the freedom 
of the question as at the difficulty of the an- 
swer. ^* Please say to her that — I amJ^ He 
spoke with a clearness that proved the steel 
surface he had in a few minutes forged for his 
despair. 

The Doctor took the thing as he gare it, 
only drawing from his pocket a key which he 
held straight up. ^*Then I feel it to be only 
right to say to you that this locks** — and he 
indicated the quarter to which Rose had re- 
tired — "the other door." 

Dennis, with a diffident hand out, looked at 
him hard; but the good man showed, with 
effect, that he was professionally used to that 
^*You mean she*s a prisoner?" 

"On Mr. Vidal's honour." 

"But whose prisoner?" 

"Mrs. Beever's." 

Dennis took the key, which passed into his 
pocket. '* Don*t you forget," he then asked with 
his conscious coldness, "that we*re here, all 
round, on a level " 

" With the garden ? " the Doctor broke in. " I 
forget nothing. WeVe a friend on the terrace*'^ 

"A friend?'* 



THB OTHSB HOUSE 847 

**Mr. Beever. A friend of Miss Armiger*8,'' 
he promptly added. 

Still showing nothing in his face, Dennis per- 
haps showed something in the way, that with 
his eyes bent on the carpet and his hands intei^ 
twisted behind him, he slowly walked across the 
room. At the end of it he turned round. ^If 
I have this key, who has the other?" 

**The other?" 

^The key that confines Mr. Bream." 

The Doctor winced, but he stood his ground. 
*' J have it." Then he said, as if with a due 
recognition of the weight of the circumstance: 
"She has told you?" 

Dennis turned it over. "Mrs. Beever?" 

"Miss Armiger." There was a faint sharp- 
ness in the Doctor*s tone. 

It had evidently something to do with the 
tone in which Dennis replied. "She has told 
me. But if you've left him " 

"I've not left him. I've brought him over." 

Dennis showed himself at a loss. "To see 
ffie/" 

The Doctor raised a solemn, reassuring hand; 
then, after an instant, "To see bis child," he 
colourlessly said. 



348  

*'He desires that?" Dennis asked with an 
accent that emulated this detachment. 

^*He desires that." Dennis turned away, and 
in the pause that followed the air seemed 
charged with a consciousness of all that between 
them was represented by the unspoken. It 
lasted indeed long enough to give to an aadit<H% 
had there been one, a sense of the dominant 
unspeakable. It was as if each were waiting to 
have something from the other first, and it was 
eventually clear that Dennis, who had not looked 
at his watch, was prepared to wait longest. The 
Doctor had moreover to recognise that he him- 
self had sought the interview. He impatiently 
summed up his sense of their common attitude. 
^'I do full justice to the diflBculty created for 
you by your engagement. That's why it was 
important to have it from your own lips." His 
companion said nothing, and he went on : ** Mrs. 
Beever, all the same, feels that it mustn't pre- 
vent us from putting you another question, or 
rather from reminding you that there^s one that 
you led her just now to expect that yooll 
answer." The Doctor paused again, but he per- 
ceived he must go all the way. ^From the 
bank of the river you saw something that bean 



THB OTHER HOT78S 849 

upon this** — he hesitated; then daintily selected 
his words — *' remarkable performance. We ap- 
peal to your sense of propriety to tell us what 
you saw." 

Dennis considered. ^* My sense of propriety is 
strong ; but so — just now — is my sense of some 
other things. My word to Mrs. Beever was con- 
tingent. There are points / want made clear." 

^^I'm here," said the Doctor, ^^to do what I 
can to satisfy you. Only be so good as to re- 
member that time is everything." He added, to 
drive this home, in his neat, brisk way, ^Some 
action has to be taken." 

^Tou mean a declaration made?" 

*^ Under penalty," the Doctor assented, **of 
consequences sufficiently tremendous. There has 
been an accident of a gravity " 

Dennis took him up. ^That can't be kept 
quiet?" 

The Doctor looked at his watch; then, stiU 
holding it, he quickly looked up. ^ Tou want to 
keep it so ? " 

Vidal's haggard face turned red, but he in- 
stantly recovered himself. *^ Why do you ask, if 
youVe a duty?" 

^ I haven't om — worse luck. I've fifty." 



850  

Dennis fixed his eyes on the watoh. "Does 
that mean you can keep the thing in hand?** 

The Doctor put his talisman away. " Before I 
say, I must know what you'll do for me.*' 

Dennis stared at the lamp. " Hasn't it gone too 
far?" 

'^I know how far. Not so far, by a peculiar 
mercy, as it might have gone. There has been an 
extraordinary coincidence of chances — a miracle 
of conditions. Everything appears to serve.** He 
hesitated ; then with great gravity : " We'll call it 
a providence and have done with it.** 

Dennis turned this over. "Do yon allude to 
the absence of witnesses ?** 

" At the moment the child was found. Only the 
blessed three of us. And she had been there — ** 
Stupefaction left him counting. 

Dennis jerked out a sick protest. " Don*t tell 

me how long I What do I want ?** What 

he wanted proved, the next moment, to be more 
knowledge. "How do you meet the servants?** 

"Here? By giving a big name to her com- 
plaint. None of them have really seen her. She 
was carried in with a success 1'* The Doc- 
tor threw up triumphant little hands. 

"But the people at the other house?** 



THB OTHER HOUSE 851 

**They know nothing but that over here she 
has had an attack which it will be one of the fifty 
duties of mine I mentioned to you to make suffi- 
ciently remarkable. She was out of sorts this 
morning ; this afternoon I was summoned. That 
call of Tony's is the providence I" Dr. Ramage 
declared. 

But still Dennis pressed him. ** Hadn't she 
some fond old nurse — some devoted dragon?" 

^*The great Gorham? Yes: she didn't want 
her to come ; she was cruelly overborne. Well," 
the Doctor lucidly pursued, **I must face the 
great Gorham. I'm already keeping her at bay — 
doctors are so luckily despots I She'll be tough 
— but it's all tough I" 

Dennis, pressing his hand to his head, began 
wearily to pace again: it was far too tough for 
Am. But he suddenly dropped upon the sofa, all 
but audibly moaning, falling back in the despair 
that broke through his false pluck. Doctor 
Ramage watched his pain as if he had something 
to hope from it; then, abruptly, the young man 

began : ** I don't in the least conceive how " 

He stopped short : even this he couldn't bring out. 

** How was it done ? Small blame to you I It 
was done in one minute — with the aid of a boat 



852  

and the temptation (well call it!) of solitade. 
The boat's an old one of Tony's own — padlocked, 
but with a long chain. To see the place,** said 
the Doctor after an instant, ^* is to see the deed.** 

Dennis threw back his head ; he covered his dis- 
torted face with his two hands. ^ Why in thun- 
der should I see it ? " 

The Doctor had moved towards him ; at this be 
seated himself beside him and, going on with 
quiet clearness, applied a controlling, soothing 
grasp to his knee. *'The child was taken into 
the boat and it was tilted: that was enough — 
the trick was played." Dennis remained motion- 
less and dumb, and his companion completed the 
picture. ^^She was immersed — she was held un- 
der water — she was made sure of. Oh, I grant 
you it took a hand — and it took a spirit t But 
they were there. Then she was left. A pull of 
the chain brought back the boat ; and the author 
of the crime walked away." 

Dennis slowly shifted his position, dropped his 
head, dropped his hands, sat staring lividly at tlie 
floor. *' But how could she be caught f *' 

The Doctor hesitated, as if in the presence of 
an ambiguity. ** The poor little girl ? You'd 
if you saw the place." 



J 



THB OTHER HOtTSS 868 

«« I passed it to come back here," Dennis said. 
" But I didn't look, for I didn't know." 

The Doctor patted his knee. *^If you had 
known you would have looked still less. She 
rose; she drifted some yards; then she washed 
against the base of the bridge, and one of the 
openings of her little dress hooked itself to an old 
loose clamp. There she was kept." 

"And no one came by?" 

^^No one came till, by the mercy of God, I 
came I " 

Dennis took it in as if with a long, dry gulp, 
and the two men sat for a minute looking at each 
other. At last the younger one got up. "And 
yet the risk of anything but a straight course is 
hideous." 

The Doctor kept his place. " Every thing's 
hideous. I appreciate greatly," he added, "the 
gallantry of your reminding me of my danger. 
Don't think I don't know exactly what it is. But 
I have to think of the danger of others. I can 
measure mine; I can't measure theirs." 

" I can return your compliment," Dennis replied. 
" ' Theirs,' as you call it, seems to me such a fine 
thing for you to care for." 

The Doctor, with his plump hands folded on 

2a 



354 THB OTHER HOU8B 

stomach, gave a small stony smile. ^Mj dear 
man, I care for my friends I '* 

Dennis stood before him ; he was visibiy mysti- 
fied. ** There's a person whom it*s very good of 
you to take this occasion of calling by that 
name ! '' 

Doctor Ramage stared; with his vision of Ida 
interlocutor's mistake all his tight curyes grew 
tense. Then, as he sprang to his feet, he seemed 
to crack in a grim little laugh. ** The person you 
have in mind is, I confess, not, my dear sir ** 

*^ One of the persons,'* said Dennis, ^ whom yoii 
wish to protect? It certainly would have soiv 
prised me to hear it I But you spoke of your 
* friends.' Who then is your second one ? " 

The Doctor looked astonished at the question. 
"Why, sweet Jean Martle." 

Dennis equally wondered. " I should have sup- 
posed her the first I Who then is the other ? ** 

The Doctor lifted his shoulders. "Who bat 
poor Tony Bream?" 

Dennis thought a moment. "What's Mm dan* 
ger?" 

The Doctor grew more amazed. "The danger 
we've been talking of I" 

"Have we been talking of thatf^* 



 855 

^*Tou ask me, when you told me you knew 



Dennis, hesitating, recalled. *' Knew that he's 
accused ?*' 

His companion fairly sprang at him. ^^ Accused 
by A^r, too?" 

Dennis fell back at his onset ** Is he by any- 
body else ? " 

The Doctor, turning crimson, had grabbed his 
arm ; he blazed up at him. *^ Tou don*t know it 
all?" 

Dennis faltered. *^Is there any more?" 

** Tony cries on the housetops that he did it I " 

Dennis sank once more on his sofa. ^^JSe 
cries ?" 

"To cover Jean." 

Dennis took it in. *^But if she ft covered?" 

"Then to shield Miss Armiger." 

Poor Denms gazed aghast. "Who meanwhile 
charges him ? " He was on his feet again ; again 
he moved to the open window and stood there 
while the Doctor, in silence, waited. Presently 
he turned round. "May I see him?" 

The Doctor, as if he had expected this, was 
already at the door. " God bless you I " And he 
flashed out. 



856 THS OTHER HOU8B 

Dennis, left alone, stood rigid in the middle of 
the room, plunged apparently in a stupor of emo- 
tion ; then, as if shaken out of it by a return of 
conscious suffering, he passed in a couple of strides 
to the door of the library. Here, however^ with 
his hand on the knob, another impulse stayed, him 
— kept him irresolute, listening, drawing his breath 
in pain. Suddenly he turned away — Tony Bream 
had come in. 



XXXI 

*' If in this miserable hour IVe asked you for a 
moment of your time,*' Dennis immediately said, 
^^ I beg you to believe it*8 only to let you know 

that anything in the world I can do for you '* 

Tony raised a hand that mutely discouraged as 
well as thanked him, but he completely delivered 
himself : ** I'm ready, whatever it is, to do on the 
spot," 

With his handsome face smitten, his red eyes 
contracted, his thick hair disordered, and his black 
garments awry, Tony had the handled, hustled 
look of a man just dragged through some riot or 
some rescue and only released to take breath. 
Like Rose, for Vidal, he was deeply disfigured, 
but with a change more passive and tragic. His 
bloodshot eyes fixed his interlocutor's. ^'I'm 
afraid there's nothing anyone can do for me. 
My disaster's overwhelming; but I must meet it 
myself." 

867 



S58 THE OTHBB H0U8B 

There was courtesy in his voice ; but there 
something bard and dry in the way he stood there, 
something so opposed to his usual fine overflow 
that for a minute Dennis could only show by pil- 
ing silence the full sense of his wretchedness. He 
was in the presence of a passionate perversity — 
an attitude in which the whole man had already 
petrified. ** Will it perhaps help you to think of 
something/' he presently said, ^* if I tell you that 
your disaster is almost as much mine as yours, and 
that what's of aid to one of us may perhaps there- 
fore be of aid to the other?" 

** It's very good of you,*' Tony replied, ** to he 
willing to take upon you the smallest comer of 
so big a burden. Don't do that — don't do that, 
Mr. Vidal," he repeated with a heavy headshake. 
^' Don't come near such a thing ; don't touch it ; 
don't know it I" He straightened himself as if 
with a long, suppressed shudder ; and then, with 
a sharper and more sombre vehemence, ^ Stand 
from under it I " he exclaimed. Dennis, in deeper 
compassion, looked at him with an intensity that 
might have suggested submission, and Tony fol- 
lowed up what he apparently took for an advan- 
tage. ^^ Tou came here for an hour, for your own 
reasons, for your relief : you came in all kindni 



THE OTHEB HOU8B 859 

and tniat. TouVe encountered an unutterable 
horror and you've only one thing to do." 

**Be 8o good as to name it,'* said Dennis. 

"Turn your back on it for ever — go your way 
this minute. I've come to you simply to say 
that" 

"Leave you, in other words " 

"By the very first train that will take you." 

Dennis appeared to turn this over; then he 
spoke with a face that showed what he thought of 
it. "It has been my unfortunate fate in coming to 
this place — so wrapped, as one might suppose, in 
comfort and peace — to intrude a second time on 
obscure, unhappy things, on suffering and danger 
and death. I should have been glad, Ood knows, 
not to renew the adventure, but one's destiny kicks 
one before it, and I seem myself not the least part 
of the misery I speak of. Tou must accept that 
as my excuse for not taking your advice. I must 
stay at least till you understand me." On this he 
waited a moment; then abruptly, impatiently, 
" For God's sake, Mr. Bream, believe in me and 
meet me I " he broke out 

"•Meet* you?" 

"Make use of the hand I hold out to you." 

Tony had remained just within the closed door. 



860 THE OTHER H0U8B 

as if to guard against its moving from the other 
side. At this, with a faint flush in his dead 
vacancy, he came a few steps further. But there 
was something still locked in his conscious, al- 
tered eyes and coldly absent from the tone in 
which he said: ** You've come, I think, from 
China ? " 
"I've come, Mr. Bream, from China." 
"And it's open to you to go back?" 
Dennis frowned. "I can do as I wish." 
"And yet you're not off like a shot?" 
"My movements and my inclinations are my 
own affair. You won't accept my aid?" 

Tony gave his sombre stare. " You ask me, as 
you call it, to meet you. Excuse me if on my 

side I ask you on what definite ground " 

Dennis took him straight up. " On the definite 
ground on which Dr. Ramage is good enough to 
do so. I'm afraid there's no better ground than 
my honour." 

Tony's stare was long and deep; then he put 
out his hand, and while Dennis held it, " I under- 
stand you," he said. " Good-bye." 

Dennis kept hold of him. " * Good-bye ' ? " 
Tony had a supreme hesitation. "She's 
safe." 



 861 

Dennis had a shorter one. **Do you speak of 
Miss Martle?" 

"Not of Miss Martle." 

** Then I can. She'% safe." 

*^ Thank you,*' said Tony. He drew away his 
hand. 

"As for the person you speak of, if y<m say 
it '' And Dennis paused. 

"She's safe," Tony repeated. 

"That's all I ask of you. The Doctor will 
do the rest." 

"I know what the Doctor will do." Tony 
was silent a moment. "What will you do?" 

Dennis faltered, but at last he spoke. " Every- 
thing but marry her." 

A flare of admiration rose and fell in Tony's 
eyes. "You're beyond me I" 

"I don't in the least know where I am, save 
that I'm in a black, bloody nightmare. It's not 
I, it's not she, it's not you, it's not anyone. I 
shall wake up at last, I suppose, but mean- 
while " 

" There's plenty more to come ? Oh, as much 
as you like I" Tony excitedly declared. 

" For me, but not for you. For you the worst's 
over," his companion boldly observed. 



362 THE OTHER HOUSS 

'^Over? -with all my life made hideoiis?'* 

There was a certain sturdiness in Vidal^a mo> 

mentary silence. "You think so now !" 

Then he added more gently: **I grant yoa it's 
hideous enough." 

Tony stood there in the agony of the actoal; 
the tears welled into his hot eyes. "She butch- 
ered — she tortured my child. And she did it 
to incriminate Jean." 

He brought it all back to Dennis* who exclaimed 
with simple solemnity: "The dear little girl — 
the sweet, kind little girl!" With a sudden 
impulse that in the midst of this tenderness 
seemed almost savage, he laid on Tony*s shoul- 
der a hard, conscientious hand. "She forced 
her in. She held her down. She left her." 

The men turned paler as they looked at each 
other. " I'm infamous — I'm infamous," said Tony. 

There was a long pause that was like a strange 
assent from Dennis, who at last, however, brought 
out in a different tone: "It was her passion." 

"It was her passion." 

"She loves you !" Dennis went on with 

a drop, before the real, of all vain terms. 

"She loves me!" — Tony's face reflected the 
mere monstrous fact. "It has made what it has 



THB OTHER HOUSB 868 

made — her awful act and mj silence. My silence 
is a part of the crime and the cruelty — I shall 
live to be a horror to myself. But I see it, none 
the less, as I see it, and I shall keep the word 
I gave her in the first madness of my fear. It 
came to me. There it is." 

^I know what came to you," Dennis said. 

Tony wondered. "Then you've seen her?" 

Dennis hesitated. ^I know it from the 
Doctor." 

i* I see " Tony thought a moment. ** She, 

I imagine " 

«' Will keep it to herself? Leave that to me ! " 
Dennis put out his hand again. *^Oood*bye." 

**You take her away?" 

•* To-night." 

Tony kept his hand. «'Will her flight help 
Ramage ? " 

^ Everything falls in. Three hours ago I came 
for her." 

"So it will seem prearranged?" 

"For the event she announced to you. Our 
happy union I" said Dennis VidaL 

He reached the door to the hall, where Tony 
checked him. "There's nothing, then, I shall 
do for you/" 



364  

"It's done. We've helped each other.'* 

What was deepest in Tony stirred again. **I 
mean when your trouble has passed." 

"It will never pass. Think of that when 
you're happy yourself." 

Tony's grey face stared. "How shall I ever 
be ?" 

The door, as he spoke, opened from the room 
to which Mrs. Beever had returned, and Jean 
Martle appeared to them. Dennis retremledL 
"Ask Aer.'" he said from the threshold. 



XXXII 

RirsHiNO to Tony, she wailed under her breath : 
*^I must speak to you — I must speak to you I 
But how can you ever look at me? — how can 
you ever forgive me?'* In an instant he had 
met her; in a flash the gulf was bridged: his 
arms had opened wide to her and she had 
thrown herself into them. They had only to be 
face to face to let themselves go; he making no 
answer but to press her close against him, she 
pouring out her tears upon him as if the contact 
quickened the source. He held her, she yielded, 
with a passion no bliss could have given them; 
they stood locked together in their misery with 
no sound and no motion but her sobs. Breast 
to breast and cheek to cheek, they felt simply 
that they had ceased to be apai*t. Their long 
embrace was the extinction of all limits, all ques- 
tions — swept away in a flood which tossed them 
over the years and in which nothing remained 

866 



866  

erect but the sense and the need of each other. 
These things had now the beauty of all the ten- 
derness that they had never spoken and that, for 
some time, even as they clung there, was too 
strange and too deep for speech. But what waa 
extraordinary was that, as Jean disengaged her- 
self, there was neither wonder nor fear between 
them ; nothing but a recognition, in which ererj- 
thing swam, and, on the girFs part, the still 
higher tide of the remorse that harried her and 
that, to see him, had made her break away from 
the others. '' They tell me I'm ill, I'm insane," 
she went on — '^they want to shut me up, to 
give me things : they tell me to lie down, to tiy 
to sleep. But it's all, to me, so dreadfully as if 
it were I who had done it, that when they ad- 
mitted to me that you were here I felt that H 
I didn't see you it would make me as crazy as 
they say. It's to have seen her go — to have 
seen her go: that's what I can't bear — it's too 
horrible I " She continued to sob ; she stood 
there before him, swayed to and fro in her grief. 
She stiiTed up his own, and that added to her 
pain ; for a minute, in their separate sorrow, thev 
moved asunder like creatures too stricken to com- 
municate. But they were quickly face to hct

again, more intimate, with more understood, 
though with the air, on either side and in the 
very freedom of their action, of a clear vision of 
the effect of their precipitated union — the in- 
stinct of not again touching it with unconse- 
orated hands. Tony had no idle words, no easy 
consolations ; she only made him see more vividly 
what had happened, and they hung over it to- 
gether while she accused and reviled herself. *' I 
let her go — I let her go ; that^s what^s so terrible, 
so hideous. I might have got her — have kept 
her ; I might have screamed, I might have rushed 
for help. But how could I know or dream ? How 

could the worst of my fears ?'* She broke off, 

she shuddered and dropped; she sat and sobbed 
while he came and went. '* I see her little face as 
she left me — she looked at me as if she knew. She 
wondered and dreaded — she knew — she knew! 
It was the last little look I was to have from 
her, and I didn^t even answer it with a kiss. 
She sat there where I could seize her, but I 
never raised a hand. I was dose, I was there 
— she must have called for me in her terror. I 
didn't listen — I didn't come — I only gave her 
up to be murdered I And now I shall be pun- 
ished for ever: I shall see her in those arms —

in those arms!" Jean flung herself down and 
hid her face; her smothered, wild lament filled 
the room. 

Tony stopped before her, seeing eTerjtliing 
she brought up, but only the more helpleos in 
his pity. *^It was the only little minute in all 
the years that you had been forced to fail lier. 
She was always more yours than mine/' 

Jean could only look out through her storm- 
beaten window. **It was just because she was 
yours that she was mine. It was because she 

was yours from the first hour that I 1** She 

broke down again; she tried to hold herself; 
she got up. **What could I do, you see? To 
you I couldn't be kind." She was as frank in 
her young, pure woe as a bride might have been 
in her joy. 

Tony looked as if he were retracing the saddest 
thing on earth. ^*I don't see how you ooold 
have been kinder." 

She wondered with her blinded eyes. **Thsi 
wasn't what I thought I was — it cauldn^t be, 
ever, eyer. Didn't I try not to think of you? 
But the child was a beautiful part of you — the 
child I could take and keep. I could take her 
altogether, without thinking or remembering. It

was the only thing I could do for jou, and you 
let me, always, and fhe did. So I thought it 
would go on, for wasn't it happiness enough? 
But all the horrible things — I didn't know them 
till to^y. There they were — so near to us; 
and there they closed over her, and — oh I " She 
turned away in a fresh conyulsion, inarticulate 
and distracted. 

They wandered in silence, as if it made them 
more companions; but at last Tony said: ^She 
was a little radiant, perfect thing. Even if she 
had not been mine you would have loved her." 
Then he went on, as if feeling his way through 
his thickest darkness: **If she had not been 
mine she wouldn't be lying there as I've seen 
her. Yet I'm glad she was mine I" he said. 

^She lies there because I loved her and be- 
cause I so recklessly showed it. That's why it's 
I who killed her I " broke passionately from Jean. 

He said nothing till he quietly and gently 
said : ^ It was I who killed her." 

She roamed to and fro, slowly controlling her- 
self, taking this at first for a mere torment like 
her own. ^We seem beautifully eager for the 
guiltl" 

*'It doesn't matter what anyone else seems.

I must tell you all — now. Tve taken the act 
on myself." 

She had stopped shorty bewildered. *^How 
have jou taken it?" 

**To meet whatever may come." 

She turned as white as ashes. ^'Toa mean 
you've accused yourself?" 

** Anyone may accuse me. Whom is it more 
natural to accuse ? What had fhe to gain ? My 
owu motive is flagrant. There it is," said Tony. 

Jean withered beneath this new stroke. ^ Toa^ll 
say you did it?" 

" I'll say I did it." 

Her face grew old with terror. "TouTl lie? 
You'll perjure yourself?" 

" I'll say I did it for your 

She suddenly turned crimson. ^Then what 
do you think PU say?" 

Tony coldly considered. ** Whatever you say 
will tell against me." 

"Against you?" 

"If the crime was committed for you." 

" * For ' me ? " she echoed again. 

"To enable us to marry." 

" Marry I — tc^e / " Jean looked at it in blighted 
horror.

^'It won't be of any consequence that we 
sha'n't, that we can't: it will only stand out clear 
that we can.^^ His sombre ingenuity halted, but 
he achieved his demonstration. '* So I shall save 
— whom I wish to save." 

Jean gave a fiercer wail. **You wish to save 
herf' 

^ I don't wish to give her up. You can't con* 
ceive it?" 

*'I?" The girl looked about her for a nega- 
tion not too vile. ^* I wish to hunt her to death I 
I wish to burn her alive I " All her emotion had 
changed to stupefaction ; the flame in her eyes had 
dried them. ** You mean she's not to suffer?" 

**You want her to suffer — all?" 

She was ablaze with the light of justice. 
**How can anything be enough? I could tear 
her limb from limb. That's what she tried to 
do to me I" 

Tony lucidly concurred. **Yes — what she 
tried to do to you." 

But she had already flashed round. *^ And yet 
you condone the atrocity ?" 

Tony thought a moment. *' Her doom will be 
to live." 

*^But how will such a fiend be suffered to

live — when she went to it before my eyes ? ^ 
Jean stared at the mountain of evidence; thexi 
eagerly : ** And Mr. Vidal — her very lover, 
who^ll swear what he knows — what he saw I ^* 

Tony stubbornly shook his head. ^Oh, Mr. 
Vidal ! " 

**To make me/' Jean cried, ^*seem the mon- 
ster " 

He looked at her so strangely that she stopped. 
^*She made it for the moment possible — 

She caught him up. ^^To suspect me ? 

" I was mad — and you weren't there." With a 
muffled moan she sank down again; she covered her 
face with her hands. '* I tell you all — I tell you 
all," he said. *^ He knows nothing — he saw nothr 
ing — he'll swear nothing. He's taking her away." 

Jean started as if he had struck her. ^ She's 
here ? " 

Tony wondered. "You didn't know it?" 

"She came back?" the girl panted. 

"You thought she had fled?" 

Jean hung there like a poised hawk. " Where 
ft she?" 

Tony gave her, with a grave gesture, a long, 
absolute look before which, gradually, her pas- 
sion fell. "She has gone. LfCt her go." 



THE OTHBB HOtJSA 878 

She was silent a little. **Bttt others: how 
wiU they ?" 

*' There are no others." After a moment he 
added : ** She would have died for me." 

The sari's pale wrath gave a flare. ^So you 
want to die for Aer/" 

^ I sha'n't die. But I shall remember." Then, 
as she watched him : ** I must tell you all," he 
said once more. ^* I knew it — I always knew it. 
And I made her come." 

**You were kind to her — as you're always 
kind." 

**No; I was more than that And I should 
have been less." His face showed a rift in the 
blackness. **I remember." 

She followed him in pain and at a distance. 
**You mean you liked it?" 

**I liked it — while I was safe. Then I grew 
afraid." 

** Afraid of what?" 

^Afraid of everything. You don't know — 
but we're abysses. At least I'm one I " he 
groaned. He seemed to sound this depth. 
^^ There are other things. They go back so 
far." 

«" Don't tell me all," said Jean. She had evi- 



874 THB OTHER HOUSE 

dently enough to turn over. '^ What will become 
of her?*' she asked. 

*'God knows. She goes forth.'* 

"And Mr. Vidal with her?" 

"Mr. Vidal with her." 

Jean grazed at the tragic picture. ^BecauM 
he still loves her?" 

"Yes," said Tony Bream. 

" Then what will he do ? " 

"Put the globe between them. Think of her 
torture," Tony added. 

Jean looked as if she tried. "Do yoa mean 
thatf' 

He meant another matter. "To have only 
made us free." 

Jean protested with all her woe. "It's her 
triumph — that our freedom is horrible I" 

Tony hesitated; then his eyes distinguished in 
the outer dusk Paul Bream, who had appeared at 
the long window which, in the mild air, stood open 
to the terrace. " It's horrible," he gravely replied. 

Jean had not seen Paul ; she only heard Tony^e 
answer. It touched again the source of tears; 
she broke again into choking sobs. So, blindly^ 
slowly, while the two men watched her, she 
passed from the room by the door at which she 
had entered.

"Tou'rb looking for me?" Tony quickly 
asked. 

Paul, blinking in the lamplight, showed the 
dismal desert of his face. ^^Isaw you through 
the open window, and I thought I would let 
you know " 

**That someone wants me?" Tony was all 
ready. 

^*She hasn't asked for you; but I think that 
if you could do it " 

"I can do anything," said Tony. "But of 
whom do you speak?" 

" Of one of your servants — poor Mrs. Oorham." 

"Effie's nurse? — she has come over?" 

" She's in the garden," Paul explained. " I've 
been floundering about — I came upon her. 

Tony wondered. "But what is she doing? 

"Crying very hard — without a sound." 

"And without coming in?" 

"Out of discretion."

Tony thought a moment. ^ Yoa memn becmme 
Jean and the Doctor ?" 

**Have taken complete charge. She bowi to 
that, but she sits there on a bench " 



^^ Weeping and wailing ? '* Tony asked. ** 
thing, 1*11 speak to her." 

He was about to leave the room in the 
mary manner permitted by the long window 
when Paul checked him with a quiet reminder. 
^^ Hadn't you better have your hat?" 

Tony looked about him — he had not hrouglii 
it in. "Why? — if it's a warm night?" 

Paul approached him, laying on him as if to 
stay him a heavy but friendly hand. ** Yoa never 
go out without it. Don't be too unusaal." 

" I see what you mean — FU get it." And he 
made for the door to the hall. 

But Paul had not done with him. ^ It's mnch 
better you should see her — it's unnatural yoa 
shouldn't But do you mind my just thinking 
for you the least bit — asking you for instance 
what it's your idea to say to her?" 

Tony had the air of accepting this solicitnde ; 
but he met the inquiry with characteristic can- 
dour. ''I think I've no idea but to talk with 
her of E£Be." 



 877 

Paul visibly wondered. ^^As dangerooaly ill? 
That*8 all she knows/* 

Tony considered an instant. ^^Yes, then — as 
dangerously ill. Whatever she*s prepared for.'* 

^ But what are you prepared for ? Yoa*re not 
afraid ?" Paul hesitoted. 

"Afraid of what?" 

** Of suspicions — importunities ; her making 



some noise." 



Tony signified a negative. "I don't think," 
he said very gravely, **that Fm afraid of poor 
Oorham." 

Paul looked as if he felt that his warning 
half fiuled. ** Everyone else is. She's tremen- 
dously devoted.** '\ 

'«Tes — that's what I mean." 

Paul sounded him a moment. " You mean to 
you;" 

The irony was so indulgent — and all irony, 
on this young man's part, was so rare — that 
Tony was to be excused for not perceiving it. 
" She'll do anything. We're the best of friends.** 

"Then get your hat," said Paul. 

"It*s much the best thing. Thank you for 
telling me." Even in a tragic hour there was 
9Q much in Tony of the ingenuous that, with ^

his habit of good-nature and his hand on the 
door, he lingered for the comfort of his friend. 
^^She'U be a resource— a fund of memoij. We 
can always . talk.^' 

*^ Oh, youVe safe ! ** Paul went on. 

It had now all come to Tony. ** I see my way 
with her.'* 

<'So do Unsaid Paul. 

Tony fairly brightened through his gloom. 
''FU keep her on I" And he went by the 
front. 

Left alone, Paul closed the door on him, hold- 
ing it a minute and lost evidently in reflectioiis of 
which he was the subject. He exhaled a long 
sigh that was burdened with many things ; then, 
as he moved away, his eyes attached themselves, 
as if in sympathy with a vague impulse, to the 
door of the library. He stood a moment irreso- 
lute ; after which, deeply restless, he went to take 
up the hat that, on coming in, he had laid on one 
of the tables. He was in the act of doing this 
when the door of the library opened and Rose 
Armiger stood before him. She had, since their 
last meeting, changed her dress, and, arrayed for a 
journey, wore a bonnet and a long, dark mantle. 
For some time after she appeared no word came

from either; but at last she said: " Can you endure 
for a minute the sight of me? " 

^^ I was hesitating — I thought of going to jou,'* 
Paul replied. " I knew you were there/* 

At this she came into the room. *^ I knew you 
were here. You passed the window." 

** Vve passed and repassed — this hour.'* 

** I've known that too, but this time I heard you 
stop. IVe no light there/* she went on, ** but the 
window, on this side, is open. I could tell that 
you had come in.*' 

Paul hesitated. **You ran a danger of not 
finding me alone." 

"I took my chance — of course I knew. Fve 
been in dread, but, in spite of it, I've seen nobody. 
I've been up to my room and come down; the 
coast was clear." 

''You've not then seen Mr. Vidal?" 

'* Oh yes — him. But he's nobody." Then, as 
if conscious of the strange sound of this: ^* No- 
body, I mean, to fear." 

Paul was silent a moment. *^What in the 
world is it you fear?" 

''In the sense of the awful things you know ? 
Here on the spot nothing. About those things 
I'm quite quiet There may be plenty to come ;

but what rm afraid of now is my safety. There's 

something in that ! " She broke down ; there 

was more in it than she could say. 

^^Are you so sure of your safety?** 

*^You see how sure. It's in your face,*' said 
Rose. ^ And your face — for what it saja — is 
terrible/' 

Whatever it said remained there as Paul looked 
at her. ^* Is it as terrible as yours ? " he asked. 

^Oh, mine — mine must be hideous; unutter- 
ably hideous for ever ! Yours is beautif uL ETexy* 
thing, everyone here is beautiful.'* 

** I don't understand you," said Paul. 

^*How should you? It isn't to ask you to do 
that that I've come to you." 

He waited in his woful wonder. ^*For ^diat 
have you come?" 

^ You can endure it, then, the sight of me 7 ** 

** Haven't I told you that I thought of going to 
you?" 

''Yes— but you didn't go," said Rose. «*Toii 
came and went like a sentinel, and if it was to 
watch me " 

Paul interrupted her. ''It wasn't to wateh 
you." 

" Then what was it for ? ** 



 881 

**It was to keep myself quiet," said Paul. 

^*But you're anything but quiet." 

^^Yes," he dismally conceded; ^^Tm anything 
but quiet." 

*^ There's something, then, that may help you : 
it's one of two things for which I've come to you. 
And there's no one but you to care. You may 
care a very little: it may give you a grain of 
comfort. Let your comfort be that I've failed." 

Paul, after a long look at her, turned away 
with a vague, dumb gesture, and it was a part 
of his sore trouble that, in his wasted strength, 
he had no outlet for emotion, no channel even 
for pain. She took in for a moment his clumsy, 
massive misery. "No — you loathe my pres- 
ence," she said. 

He stood awhile in silence with his back to 
her, as if, within him, some violence were strug- 
gling up ; then with an effort, almost with a gasp, 
he turned round, his open watch in his hand. 

I saw Mr. Yidal " was all he brought out. 
And he told you too he would come back 
for me?" 

"He said there was something he had to do, 
but that you would meanwhile get ready. He 
would return immediately with a carriage."

"« That's why Fyo waited," Rose replied. «*rm 
readj enough. Bat he won't come." 

«" Hell come," said PanL ^ But it's moie than 
time." 

She drearil J shook her head. *^ Not after get- 
ting off — not back to the horror and the shame. 
He thought so ; no doubt he has tried. But it's 
bejond him." 

^Then what are jou waiting for?" 

She hesitated. ^ Nothing — now. Thank 70a." 
She looked about her. ""How shall I go?" 

Paul went to the window; for a moment he 
listened. **I thought I heard wheels." 

She gave ear; but once more she shook her 
head. ^ There are no wheels, but I can go that 
way." 

He turned back again, heavy and uncertain; 
he stood wavering and wondering in her path. 
*^What will become of you?" he asked. 

^^How do I know and what do I care?" 

** What will become of you? what will become 
of you?" he went on as if he had not heard 
her. 

^*Tou pity me too much," she answered after 
an instant. ^ Fve failed, but I did what I couUL

me. It took hold of me, it possessed me : it was 
the last gleam of a chance." 

Paul flashed like a sick man under a new 
wave of despair. *^A chance for what?" 

^*To make him hate her. You'll say my cal- 
culation was grotesque — my stupidity as ignoble 
as my crime. All I can answer is that I might, 
none the less, have succeeded. People have — 
in worse conditions. But I don't defend myself 
— I'm face to face with my mistake. I'm face 
to face with it for ever — and that's how I wish 
you to see me. Liook at me well I " 

** I would have done anything for you I " He 
broke out as if all talk with her were vain. 

She considered this; her dreadful face was 
lighted by the response it kindled. ** Would 
you do anything now?" Paul answered noth- 
ing; he seemed lost in the yision of what was 
carrying her through. ** I saw it as I saw it," 
she continued: ^Hhere it was and there it is. 
There it is — there it is," she repeated in a tone 
sharp, for a flash, with all the excitement she 
contrived to keep under. ^*It has notiiing to do 
now with any part of me — any other possibility 
even of what may be worst in me. It's a storm 
that's past, it's a debt that's paid. I may liter- 



884  

ally be better.^' At the expression this brought 
into his face she interrupted herself. *^ Yoa 
don't understand a word I saj ! " 

He was following her — as she showed she 
could see — only in the light of his own emo- 
tion ; not in that of any feeling that she herself 
could present. ^^Why didn't you speak to me 
— why didn't you tell me what you were think- 
ing? There was nothing you couldn't have told 
me, nothing that wouldn't have brought me 
nearer. If I had known your abasement '* 

"What would you have done?" Rose de* 
manded. 

"I would have saved you." 

" What would you have done ? " she pressed. 

" Everything." 

She was silent while he went to the window. 
" Yes, I've lost you — I've lost you," she said at 
last. " And you were the thing I might have had. 
Re told me that, and I knew it." 

"*He' told you?" Paul had faced round. 

'^ He tried to put me off on you. That was 
what finished me. Of course they'll marry," she 
abruptly continued. 

"Oh, yes, they'll marry." 

" But not soon, do you suppose ? " 



THB OTHEB H0U8B 885 

*^Not soon. But sooner than they think/' 

Rose looked surprised. ^ Do you already know 
what they think?" 

•* Yes — that it will never be." 

" Never ? " 

^ Coming about so horribly. But some day — 
it will be." 

«' It will be," said Rose. "^ And I shall have 
done it for him. That's more," she said, *^ than 
even you would have done for hm." 

Strange tears had found their way between 
Paul's close lids. *^ You're too horrible," he 
breathed ; ^* you're too horrible." 

^* Oh, I talk only to you : it's aU for you. Re- 
member, please, that I shall never speak again. 
You see," she went on, ** that he daren't come." 

Paul looked afresh at his watch. , ** 111 go with 
you." 

Rose hesitated. ''How far?" 

'' I'll go with you," he simply repeated. 

She looked at him hard ; in her eyes too there 
were tears. ** My safety — my safety I " she mur- 
mured. 

Paul went round for his hat, which, on his 

entrance, he had put down. ^ I'll go with you," 

he said once more. 
2o

Still, however, she hesitated. ** Won't iu need 
you?" 

"Tony?— for what?" 

** For help." 

It took Paul a moment to tmderatand. ** He 
wants none.' 

"You mean he has nothing to fear?" 

"From any suspicion ? Nothing." 

"That's his advantage," said Rose. "People 
like him too much." 

"People like him too much," Paul replied. 
Then he exclaimed: "Mr. Vidal!" — to which, 
as she looked, Rose responded with a low, de^ 
moan. 

Dennis had appeared at the window; he gave 
signal in a short, sharp gesture and remained 
standing in the dusk of the terrace. Paul put 
down lus hat ; he turned away to leave his com* 
panion free. She approached him while Dennis 
waited ; she lingered desperately, she wavered, as 
if with a last word to speak. Ab he only stood 
rigid, however, she faltered, choking her impulse 
and giving her word the form of a look. The look 
held her a moment, held her so long that Dennis 
spoke sternly from the darkness : " Come I " At 
this, for as long a space, she fixed her eyee on him ; 



THB OTHEB HOUSE 887 

then, while the two xnen stood motionleas, she 
decided and reached the window. He put oat a 
hand and seized her, and they passed quickly into 
the night. Paul, left alone, again sounded a long 
sigh ; this time it was the deep breath of a man 
who has seen a great danger averted. It had 
scarcely died away before Tony Bream returned. 
He came in from the hall as eagerly as he had 
gone out, and, finding Paul, gave him his news : 
"Well — I took her home." 

Paul required a minute to carry his thoughts 
back to Gorham. " Oh, she went quietly ? " 

" Like a bleating lamb. She's too glad to stay 
on. 

Paul turned this over ; but as if his confidence 
now had solid ground he asked no question. 
** Ah, you're all right I " he simply said. 

Tony arrived at the door through which Jean 
had left the room ; he paused there in surprise at 
tUs incongruous expression. Tet there was some- 
thing absent in the way he echoed " All right? " 

"I mean you have such a pull. You'll meet 
nothing but sympathy." 

Tony looked indifferent and uncertain ; but his 
optimism finally assented. " I daresay I shall get 
on. People perhaps won't challenge me." 



888  

"They like you too muoh.*' 

Tony, with his hand on the door, appatied 
struck with this ; but it embittered again the taste 
of his tragedy. He remembered, with all his 
Tividness, to what tune he had been ^ liked,** and 
he wearily bowed his head. " Oh, too much, my 
boy,'' he said as he went out.
