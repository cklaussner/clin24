THE people of France have made it no secret 
that those of England, as a general thing, are, to 
their perception, an -inexpressive and speechless 
race, perpendicular and unsociable, unaddicted to 
enriching any bareness of contact with verbal or 
other embroidery. This view might have derived 
encouragement, a few years ago, in Paris, from 
the manner in which four persons sat together in 
silen :e, one fine day about noon, in the garden, 
as it is called, of the Palais de 1 Industrie the 
central court of the great glazed bazaar where, 
among plants and parterres, graveled walks and 
thin fountains, are ranged the figures and groups, 
the monuments and busts, which form, in the an 
nual exhibition of the Salon, the department of 
statuary. The spirit of observation is naturally 
high at the Salon, quickened by a thousand artful 
or artless appeals, but no particular tension of the 
visual sense would have been required to embrace 
the character of the four persons in question. As 
a solicitation of the eye on definite grounds, they 



 

too constituted a successful plastic fact ; and even 
the most superficial observer would have per 
ceived them to be striking products of an insular 
neighborhood, representatives of that tweed-and- 
waterproof class with which, on the recurrent oc 
casions when the English turn out for a holiday 
Christmas and Easter, Whitsuntide and the 
autumn Paris besprinkles itself at a night s 
notice. They had about them the indefinable 
professional look of the British traveler abroad ; 
that air of preparation for exposure, material and 
moral, which is so oddly combined with the se 
rene revelation of security and of persistence, and 
which excites, according to individual suscepti 
bility, the ire or the admiration of foreign com 
munities. They were the more unmistakable as 
they illustrated very favorably the energetic race 
to which they had the honor to belong. The 
fresh, diffused light of the Salon made them clear 
and important ; they were finished productions, 
in their way, and ranged there motionless, on 
their green bench, they were almost as much on 
exhibition as if they had been hung on the line. 

Three ladies and a young man, they were ob 
viously a family a mother, two daughters and 
a son a circumstance which had the effect at 
once of making each member of the group doubly 
typical and of helping to account for their fine 
taciturnity. They were not, with each other, 
on terms of ceremony, and moreover they were 
probably fatigued with their course among the 



 3 

pictures, the rooms on the upper floor. Their 
attitude, on the part of visitors who had superior 
features, even if they might appear to some pass 
ers-by to have neglected a fine opportunity for 
completing these features with an expression, was, 
after all, a kind of tribute to the state of exhaus 
tion, of bewilderment, to which the genius of 
France is still capable of reducing the proud. 

" En v la des abrutis ! " more than one of their 
fellow-gazers might have been heard to exclaim ; 
and certain it is that there was something de 
pressed and discouraged in this interesting group, 
who sat looking vaguely before them, not noticing 
the life of the place, somewhat as if each had 
a private anxiety. A very close observer would 
have guessed that though on many questions 
they were closely united, this present anxiety was 
not the same for each. If they looked grave, 
moreover, this was doubtless partly the result of 
their all being dressed in mourning, as if for a 
recent bereavement. The eldest of the three 
ladies had indeed a face of a fine austere mould, 
which would have been moved to gayety only by 
some force more insidious than any she was likely 
to recognize in Paris. Cold, still and considerably 
worn, it was neither stupid nor hard, but it was 
firm, narrow and sharp. This competent matron, 
acquainted evidently with grief, but not weakened 
by it, had a high forehead, to which the quality 
of the skin gave a singular polish it glittered 
even when seen at a distance ; a nose which 



4  

achieved a high, free curve ; and a tendency to 
throw back her head and carry it well above her, 
as if to disengage it from the possible entangle 
ments of the rest of her person. If you had seen 
her walk, you would have perceived that she trod 
the earth in a manner suggesting that in a world 
where she had long since discovered that one 
could n t have one s own way, one could never 
tell what annoying aggression might take place, 
so that it was well, from hour to hour, to save 
what one could. Lady Agnes saved her head, 
her white triangular forehead, over which her 
closely crinkled flaxen hair, reproduced in differ 
ent shades in her children, made a sort of looped 
silken canopy, like the marquee at a garden party. 
Her daughters were tall, like herself that was 
visible even as they sat there and one of them, 
the younger evidently, was very pretty : a straight, 
slender, gray-eyed English girl, with a " good " 
figure and a fresh complexion. The sister, who 
was not pretty, was also straight and slender and 
gray-eyed. But the gray, in this case, was not 
so pure, nor were the straightness and the slen- 
derness so maidenly. The brother of these 
young ladies had taken off his hat, as if he felt 
the air of the summer day heavy in the great pa 
vilion. He was a lean, strong, clear-faced youth, 
with a straight nose and light-brown hair, which 
lay continuously and profusely back from his 
forehead, so that to smooth it from the brow to 
the neck but a single movement of the hand was 



 5 

required. I cannot describe him better than by 
saying that he was the sort of young Englishman 
who looks particularly well abroad, and whose 
general aspect his inches, his limbs, his 
friendly eyes, the modulation of his voice, the 
cleanness of his flesh-tints and the fashion of his 
garments excites on the part of those who en 
counter him in far countries on the ground of a 
common speech a delightful sympathy of race. 
This sympathy is sometimes qualified by an ap 
prehension of undue literalness, but it almost 
revels as soon as such a danger is dispelled. We 
shall see quickly enough how accurate a measure 
it might have taken of Nicholas Dormer. There 
was food for suspicion, perhaps, in the wandering 
blankness that sat at moments in his eyes, as if 
he had no attention at all, not the least in the 
world ; at his command ; but it is no more than 
just to add, without delay, that this discouraging 
symptom was known, among those who liked him, 
by the indulgent name of dreaminess. For his 
mother and sisters, for instance, his dreaminess 
was notorious. He is the more welcome to the 
benefit of such an interpretation as there is al 
ways held to be something engaging in the com 
bination of the muscular and the musing, the 
mildness of strength. 

After some time, a period during which these 
good people might have appeared to have come, 
individually, to the Palais de 1 Industrie much 
less to see the works of art than to think over 



6  

their domestic affairs, the young man, rousing 
himself from his reverie, addressed one of the 
girls. 

" I say, Biddy, why should we sit moping here 
all day ? Come and take a turn about with me." 

His younger sister, while he got up, leaned for 
ward a little, looking round her, but she gave, for 
the moment, no further sign of complying with 
his invitation. 

" Where shall we find you, then, if Peter 
comes ? " inquired the other Miss Dormer, mak 
ing no movement at all. 

" I dare say Peter won t come. He 11 leave us 
here to cool our heels." 

" Oh, Nick, dear ! " Biddy exclaimed in a sweet 
little voice of protest. It was plainly her theory 
that Peter would come, and even, a little, her ap 
prehension that she might miss him should she 
quit that spot. 

" We shall come back in a quarter of an hour. 
Really, I must look at these things," Nick de 
clared, turning his face to a marble group which 
stood near them, on the right a man, with the 
skin of a beast round his loins, tussling with a 
naked woman in some primitive effort of court 
ship or capture. 

Lady Agnes followed the direction of her son s 
eyes, and then observed : 

" Everything seems very dreadful. I should 
think Biddy had better sit still. Has n t she seen 
enough horrors up above ? " 



 7 

" I dare say that if Peter comes, Julia will be 
with him," the elder girl remarked irrelevantly. 

" Well, then, he can take Julia about. That 
will be more proper," said Lady Agnes. 

" Mother, dear, she does n t care a rap about 
art. It s a fearful bore looking at fine things 
with Julia," Nick rejoined. 

"Won t you go with him, Grace?" said Biddy, 
appealing to her sister. 

" I think she has awfully good taste ! " Grace 
exclaimed, not answering this inquiry. 

" Dorit say nasty things about her ! " Lady 
Agnes broke out, solemnly, to her son, after rest 
ing her eyes on him a moment with an air of re 
luctant reprobation. 

"I say nothing but what she d say herself," 
the young man replied. "About some things 
she has very good taste, but about this kind of 
thing .she has no taste at all." 

"That s better, I think," said Lady Agnes, 
turning her eyes again to the "kind of thing" 
that her son appeared to designate. 

" She s awfully clever awfully ! " Grace went 
on, with decision. 

" Awfully, awfully ! " her brother repeated, 
standing in front of her and smiling down at 
her. 

" You are nasty, Nick, You know you are," 
said the young lady, but more in sorrow than in 
anger. 

Biddy got up at this, as if the accusatory tone 



8 7"HE TRAGIC MUSE. 

prompted her to place herself generously at his 
side. " Might n t you go and order lunch, in 
that place, you know ? " she asked of her mo 
ther. " Then we would come back when it was 
ready." 

" My dear child, I can t order lunch," Lady 
Agnes replied, with a cold impatience which 
seemed to intimate that she had problems far 
more important than those of victualing to con 
tend with. 

" I mean Peter, if he comes. I am sure he s 
up in everything of that sort." 

" Oh, hang Peter ! " Nick exclaimed. " Leave 
him out of account, and do order lunch, mother ; 
but not cold beef and pickles." 

" I must say about him you re not nice," 
Biddy ventured to remark to her brother, hesitat 
ing, and even blushing, a little. 

" You make up for it, my dear," the young man 
answered, giving her chin a very charming, 
rotund little chin a friendly whisk with his 
forefinger. 

" I can t imagine what you Ve got against him," 
her ladyship murmured, gravely. 

" Dear mother, it s disappointed fondness," 
Nick argued. " They won t answer one s notes ; 
they won t let one know where they are nor 
what to expect. Hell has no fury like a woman 
scorned ; nor like a man either." 

" Peter has such a tremendous lot to do it s 
a very busy time at the Embassy ; there are sure 



 9 

to be reasons," Biddy explained, with her pretty 
eyes. 

" Reasons enough, no doubt ! " said Lady Ag 
nes, who accompanied these words with an ambig 
uous sigh, however, as if in Paris even the best 
reasons would naturally be bad ones. 

" Does n t Julia write to you, does n t she an 
swer you the very day ? " Grace inquired, looking 
at Nick as if she were the courageous one. 

He hesitated a moment, returning her glance 
with a certain severity. " What do you know 
about my correspondence ? No doubt I ask too 
much," he went on ; "I m so attached to them. 
Dear olcT Peter, dear old Julia ! " 

" She s younger than you, my dear ! " cried 
the elder girl, still resolute. 

" Yes, nineteen days." 

" I m glad you know her birthday." 

" She knows yours ; she always gives you some 
thing, Lady Agnes resumed, to her son. 

" Her taste is good then, is n t it, Nick ? " Grace 
Dormer continued. 

" She makes charming presents ; but, dear mo 
ther, it is n t her taste. It s her husband s." 

" Her husband s ? " 

"The beautiful objects of which she disposes 
so freely are the things he collected, for years, 
laboriously, devotedly, poor man ! " 

" She "disposes of them to you, but not to oth 
ers," said Lady Agnes. " But that s all right," 
she added, as if this might have been taken for 



10  

a complaint of the limitations of Julia s bounty. 
" She has to select, among so many, and that s a 
proof of taste," her ladyship went on. 

" You can t say she does n t choose lovely ones," 
Grace remarked to her brother, in a tone of some 
triumph. 

" My dear, they are all lovely. George Dallow s 
judgment was so sure, he was incapable of mak 
ing a mistake," Nicholas Dormer returned. 

" I don t see how you can talk cf hi^h ; he was 
dreadful," said Lady Agnes. 

" My dear, if he was good enough for Julia to 
marry, he is good enough for one to talk of." 

" She did him a great honour." 

" I dare say ; but he was not unworthy of it. 
No such intelligent collection of beautiful objects 
has been made in England in our time." 

"You think too much of beautiful objects," 
returned her ladyship. 

" I thought you were just now implying that I 
thought too little." 

" It s very nice his having left Julia so well 
off," Biddy interposed, soothingly, as if she fore 
saw a tangle. 

" He treated her en grand seigneur, absolutely," 
Nick went on. 

" He used to look greasy, all the same," Grace 
Dormer pursued, with a kind of dull irreconci 
lability. " His name ought to have been Tal 
low." 

" You are not saying what Julia would like, if 



 II 

that s what you are trying to say/ her brother 
remarked. 

" Don t be vulgar, Grace," said Lady Agnes. 

" I know Peter Sherringham s birthday ! " 
Biddy broke out innocently, as a pacific diver 
sion. She had passed her hand into her brother s 
arm, to signify her readiness to go with him, 
while she scanned the remoter portions of the 
garden as if it had occurred to her that to direct 
their steps in some such sense might after all be 
the shorter way to get at Peter. 

" He s too much older than you, my dear," 
Grace rejoined, discouragingly. 

" That s why I Ve noticed it he s thirty- 
four. Do you call that too old ? I don t care 
for slobbering infants ! " Biddy cried. 

" E on t be vulgar," Lady Agnes enjoined 
again. 

" Come, Bid, we 11 go and be vulgar together ; 
for that s what we are, I m afraid," her brother 
said to her. " We 11 go and look at all these low 
works of art." 

" Do you really think it s necessary to the 
child s development ? " Lady Agnes demanded, 
as the pair turned away. Nicholas Dormer was 
struck as by a kind of challenge, and he paused, 
lingering a moment, with his little sister on his 
arm. "What we ve been through this morning 
in this place, and what you ve paraded before 
our eyes the murders, the tortures, all kinds 
of disease and indecency ! " 



12  

Nick looked at his mother as if this sudden 
protest surprised him, but as if also there were 
lurking explanations of it which he quickly 
guessed. Her resentment had the effect not so 
much of animating her cold face as of making it 
colder, less expressive, though visibly prouder. 
"Ah, dear mother, don t do the British ma 
tron ! " he exclaimed, good-humoredly. 

" British matron is soon said ! I don t know 
what they are coming to." 

" How odd that you should have been struck 
only with the disagreeable things, when, for my 
self, I have felt it to be most interesting, the 
most suggestive morning I have passed for ever 
so many months ! " 

" Oh, Nick, Nick ! " Lady Agnes murmured, 
with a strange depth of feeling. 

" I like them better in London they are much 
less unpleasant," said Grace Dormer. 

" They are things you can look at," her lady 
ship went on. " We certainly make the better 
show." 

"The subject does n t matter; it s the treat 
ment, the treatment ! " Biddy announced, in a 
voice like the tinkle of a silver bell. 

" Poor little Bid ! " her brother cried, breaking 
into a laugh. 

" How can I learn to model, mamma dear, if I 
don t look at things and if I don t study them ? " 
the girl continued. 

This inquiry passed unheeded, and Nicholas 



 13 

Dormer said to his mother, more seriously, but 
with a certain kind explicitness, as if he could 
make a particular allowance : " This place is an 
immense stimulus to me ; it refreshes me, excites 
me, it s such an exhibition of artistic life. It s 
full of ideas, full of refinements ; it gives one 
such an impression of artistic experience. They 
try everything, they feel everything. While you 
were looking at the murders, apparently, I ob 
served an immense deal of curious and interest 
ing work. There are too many of them, poor 
devils ; so many who must make their way, who 
must attract attention. Some of them can only 
taper fort, stand on their heads, turn summersaults 
or commit deeds of violence, to make people 
notice them. After that, no doubt, a good many 
will be quieter. But I don t know ; to-day I m 
in an appreciative mood I feel indulgent even 
to them : they give me an impression of intelli 
gence, of eager observation. All art is one re 
member that, Biddy, dear," the young man con 
tinued, looking down at his sister with a smile. 
" It s the same great, many-headed effort, and any 
ground that s gained by an individual, any spark 
that s struck in any province, is of use and of 
suggestion to all the others. We are all in the 
same boat." 

1 We, do you say, my dear ? Are you really 
setting up for an artist ? " Lady Agnes asked. 

Nick hesitated a moment " I was speaking 
for Biddy ! " 



14 THE TKAGIC MUSE. 

" But you are one, Nick you are ! " the girl 
cried. 

Lady Agnes looked for an instant as if she 
were going to say once more, " Don t be vulgar ! " 
But she suppressed these words, if she had in 
tended them, and uttered others, few in number 
and not completely articulate, to the effect that 
she hated talking about art. While her son 
spoke she had watched him as if she failed to 
follow him ; yet something in the tone of her ex 
clamation seemed to denote that she had under 
stood him only too well. 

" We are all in the same boat," Biddy repeated, 
smiling at her. 

" Not me, if you please ! " Lady Agnes replied. 
" It s horrid, messy work, your modeling." 

"Ah, but look at the results!" said the girl, 
eagerly, glancing about at the monuments in 
the garden as if in regard even to them she 
were, through that unity of art that her brother 
had just proclaimed, in some degree an effective 
cause. 

"There s a great deal being done here a 
real vitality," Nicholas Dormer went on, to his 
mother, in the same reasonable, informing way. 
" Some of these fellows go very far." 

" They do, indeed ! " said Lady Agnes. 

"I m fond of young schools, like this move 
ment in sculpture," Nick remarked, with his 
slightly provoking serenity. 

" They re old enough to know better ! " 



 15 

"May n t I look, mamma? It is necessary to 
my development," Biddy declared. 

" You may do as you like," said Lady Agnes, 
with dignity. 

" She ought to see good work, you know," the 
young man went on. 

" I leave it to your sense of responsibility." 
This statement was somewhat majestic, and for 
a moment, evidently, it tempted Nick, almost 
provoked him, or at any rate suggested to him 
an occasion to say something that he had on his 
mind. Apparently, however, .he judged the oc 
casion on the whole not good enough, and his 
sister Grace interposed with the inquiry 

" Please, mamma, are we never going to 
lunch ? " 

"A ,i, mother, mother!" the young man mur 
mured, in a troubled way, looking down at Lady 
Agnes with a deep fold in his forehead. 

For her, also, as she returned his look, it 
seemed an occasion ; but with this difference, 
that she had no hesitation in taking advantage 
of it. She was encouraged by his slight embar 
rassment ; for ordinarily Nick was not embar 
rassed. " You used to have so much," she went 
on ; "but sometimes I don t know what has be 
come of it it seems all, all gone ! " 

" Ah, mother, mother ! " he exclaimed again, as 
if there were so many things to say that it was 
impossible to choose. But this time he, stepped 
closer, bent over her, and, in spite of the publi- 



1 6  

city of their situation, gave her a quick, expres 
sive kiss. The foreign observer whom I took 
for granted in beginning to sketch this scene 
would have had to admit that the rigid English 
family had, after all, a capacity for emotion. 
Grace Dormer, indeed, looked round her to see 
if at this moment they were noticed. She discov 
ered with satisfaction that they had escaped. 



II. 

NICK DORMER walked away with Biddy, but he 
had not gone far before he stopped in front of a 
clever bust, where his mother, in the distance, 
saw him playing in the air with his hand, carrying 
out by this gesture, which presumably was ap 
plausive, some critical remark he had made to his 
sister. Lady Agnes raised her glass to her eyes 
by the long handle to which rather a clanking 
chain was attached, perceiving that the bust rep 
resented an ugly old man with a bald head ; at 
which her ladyship indefinitely sighed, though it 
was not apparent in what way such an object 
could be detrimental to her daughter. Nick 
passed on, and quickly paused again ; this time, 
his mother discerned, it was before the marble 
image of a grimacing woman. Presently she lost 
sight of him ; he wandered behind things, look 
ing at them all round. 

" I ought to get plenty of ideas for my model 
ing, oughtn t I, Nick?" his sister inquired of 
him, after a moment. 

" Ah, my poor child, what shall I say ? " 

" Don t you think 1 have any capacity for 
ideas ? " the girl continued, ruefully. 

" Lots of them, no doubt. But the capacity 



1 8  

for applying them, for putting them into prac 
tice how much of that have you ? " 
" How can I tell till I try ? " 
" What do you mean by trying, Biddy, dear ? " 
" Why, you know you ve seen me." 
" Do you call that trying ? " her brother asked, 
smiling at her. 

" Ah, Nick ! " murmured the girl, sensitively. 
Then, with more spirit, she went on : " And 
please, what do you ? " 

"Well, this, for instance;" and her companion 
pointed to another bust a head of a young 
man, in terra cotta, at which they had just ar 
rived ; a modern young man, to whom, with his 
thick neck, his little cap, and his wide ring of 
dense curls, the artist had given the air of a Flo 
rentine of the time of Lorenzo. 

Biddy looked at tie image a moment. "Ah, 
that s not trying ; that s succeeding." 

"Not altogether; it s only trying seriously." 
" Well, why should n t I be serious ? " 
" Mother would n t like it. She has inherited 
the queer old superstition that art is pardonable 
only so long as it s bad so long as it s done 
at odd hours, for a little distraction, like a game 
of tennis or of whist. The only thing that can 
justify it, the effort to carry it as far as one can 
(which you can t do without time and singleness 
of purpose), she regards as just the dangerous, 
the criminal element. It s the oddest hind-part- 
before view, the drollest immorality." 



 19 

" She does n t want one to be professional," 
Biddy remarked, as if she could do justice to every 
system. 

" Better leave it alone, then : there are duffers 
enough." 

" I don t want to be a duffer," Biddy said. 
"But I thought you encouraged me." 

" So I did, my poor child. It was only to en 
courage myself." 

" With your own work your painting ? " 

" With my futile, my ill-starred endeavors. 
Union is strength ; so that we might present a 
wider front, a larger surface of resistance." 

Biddy was silent a moment, while they con 
tinued their tour of observation. She noticed 
how her brother passed over some things quickly, 
his first glance sufficing to show him whether 
they wsre worth another, and recognized, in a 
momen: the figures that had something in them. 
His tone puzzled her, but his certainty of eye im 
pressed her, and she felt what a difference there 
was yet between them how much longer, in 
every case, she would have taken to discriminate. 
She was aware that she could rarely tell whether 
a picture was good or bad until she had looked 
at it for ten minutes ; and modest little Biddy was 
compelled privately to add, " And often not even 
then." She was mystified, as I say (Nick was 
often mystifying it was his only fault), but one 
thing was definite : her brother was exceedingly 
clever. It was the consciousness of this that 



2O  

made her remark at last, " I don t so much care 
whether or no I please mamma, if I please you." 

" Oh, don t lean on me. I m a wretched broken 
reed I m no use really ! " Nick Dormer ex 
claimed. 

"Do you mean you re a duffer?" Biddy asked, 
alarmed. 

" Frightful, frightful ! " 

" So that you mean to give up your work to 
let it alone, as you advise me ? " 

" It has never been my work, Biddy. If it had, 
it would be different. I should stick to it." 

" And you wont stick to it ? " the girl ex 
claimed, standing before him, open-eyed. 

Her brother looked into her eyes a moment, 
and she had a compunction ; she feared she was 
indiscreet and was worrying him. " Your ques 
tions are much simpler than the elements out of 
which my answer should come." 

" A great talent what is simpler than that ? " 

" One thing, dear Biddy : no talent at all ! " 

" Well, yours is so real, you can t help it." 

" We shall see, we shall see," said Nicholas 
Dormer. " Let us go look at that big group." 

" We shall see if it s real ? " Biddy went on, as 
she accompanied him. 

" No ; we shall see if I can t help it. What 
nonsense Paris makes one talk ! " the young man 
added, as they stopped in front of the composi 
tion. This was true, perhaps, but not in a sense 
which he found himself tempted to deplore. The 



 21 

present was far from being his first visit to the 
French capital : he had often quitted England, 
and usually made a point of " putting in," as he 
called it, a few days there on the outward journey 
to the Continent or on the return ; but on this 
occasion the emotions, for the most part agree 
able, attendant upon a change of air and of scene 
had been more punctual and more acute than for 
a long time before, and stronger the sense of 
novelty, refreshment, amusement, of manifold 
suggestions looking to that quarter of thought to 
which, on the whole, his attention was apt most 
frequently, though not most confessedly, to stray. 
He was fonder of Paris than most of his country 
men, though not so fond, perhaps, as some other 
captivated aliens : the place had always had the 
pow &gt;r of quickening sensibly the life of reflection 
and of observation within him. It was a good 
while since the reflections engendered by his situ 
ation there had been so favorable to the city by 
the Seine ; a good while, at all events, since they 
had ministered so to excitement, to exhilaration, 
to ambition, even to a restlessness which was not 
prevented from being agreeable by the nervous 
quality in it. Dormer could have given the reason 
of this unwonted glow ; but his preference was 
very much to keep it to himself. Certainly, to 
persons not deeply knowing, or at any rate not 
deeply curious, in relation to the young man s 
history, the explanation might have seemed to 
beg the question, consisting as it did of the simple 



22  

formula that he had at last come to a crisis. Why 
a crisis what was it, and why had he not come 
to it before ? The reader shall learn these things 
in time, if he care enough for them. 

For several years Nicholas Dormer had not 
omitted to see the Salon, which the general voice, 
this season, pronounced not particularly good. 
None the less, it was the exhibition of this season 
that, for some cause connected with his "crisis," 
made him think fast, produced that effect which 
he had spoken of to his mother as a sense of 
artistic life. The precinct of the marbles and 
bronzes appealed to him especially to-day ; the 
glazed garden, not florally rich, with its new pro 
ductions alternating with perfunctory plants and 
its queer, damp smell, partly the odor of plastic 
clay, of the studios of sculptors, spoke to him 
with the voice of old associations, of other visits, 
of companionships that were closed an insinu 
ating eloquence which was at the same time, 
somehow, identical with the general sharp con 
tagion of Paris. There was youth in the air, and 
a multitudinous newness, forever reviving, and 
the diffusion of a hundred talents, ingenuities, 
experiments. The summer clouds made shadows 
on the roof of the great building; the white 
images, hard in their crudity, spotted the place 
with provocations ; the rattle of plates at the 
restaurant sounded sociable in the distance, and 
our young man congratulated himself more than 
ever that he had not missed the exhibition. He 



 2$ 

felt that it would help him to settle something. 
At the moment he made this reflection his eye 
fell upon a person who appeared just in the 
first glimpse to carry out the idea of help. He 
uttered a lively ejaculation, which, however, in its 
want of finish, Biddy failed to understand ; so 
pertinent, so relevant and congruous, was the 
other party to this encounter. 

The girl s attention followed her brother s, 
resting with his on a young man who faced them 
without seeing them, engaged as he was in im 
parting to two persons who were with him his 
ideas about one of the works exposed to view. 
What Biddy discerned was that this young man 
was fair and fat and of the middle stature ; he 
had a round face and a short beard, and on his 
crown a mere reminiscence of hair, as the fact 
that ho carried his hat in his hand permitted it to 
be observed. Bridget Dormer, who was quick, 
estimated him immediately as a gentleman, but a 
gentleman unlike any other gentleman she had 
ever seen. She would have taken him for a for 
eigner, but that the words proceeding from his 
mouth reached her ear and imposed themselves 
as a rare variety of English. It was not that a 
foreigner might not have spoken excellent Eng 
lish, nor yet that the English of this young man 
was not excellent. It had, on the contrary, a 
conspicuous and aggressive perfection, and Biddy 
was sure that no mere learner would have ven 
tured to play such tricks with the tongue. He 



24 , 

seemed to draw rich effects and wandering airs 
from it to modulate and manipulate it as he 
would have done a musical instrument. Her 
view of the gentleman s companions was less 
operative, save that she made the rapid reflection 
that they were people whom in any country, from 
China to Peru, one would immediately have taken 
for natives. One of them was an old lady with 
a shawl ; that was the most salient way in which 
she presented herself. The shawl was an an 
cient, voluminous fabric of embroidered cashmere, 
such as many ladies wore forty years ago in their 
walks abroad, and such as no lady wears to-day. 
It had fallen half off the back of the wearer, but at 
the moment Biddy permitted herself to consider 
her she gave it a violent jerk and brought it up to 
her shoulders again, where she continued to ar 
range and settle it, with a good deal of jauntiness 
and elegance, while she listened to the talk of the 
gentleman. Biddy guessed that this little trans 
action took place very frequently, and she was not 
unaware that it gave the old lady a droll, factitious, 
faded appearance, as if she were singularly out of 
step with the age. The other person was very 
much younger she might have been a daugh 
ter and had a pale face, a low forehead and 
thick, dark hair. What she chiefly had, however, 
Biddy rapidly discovered, was a pair of largely- 
gazing eyes. Our young friend was helped to the 
discovery by the accident of their resting at this 
moment, for a little while it struck Biddy as 



 2$ 

very long on her own. Both of these ladies 
were clad in light, thin, scanty gowns, giving an 
impression of flowered figures and odd transpar 
encies, and in low shoes, which showed a great 
deal of stocking and were ornamented with large 
rosettes. Biddy s slightly agitated perception 
traveled directly to their shoes : they suggested 
to her vaguely that the wearers were dancers 
connected possibly with the old-fashioned exhibi 
tion of the shawl-dance. By the time she had 
taken in so much as this the mellifluous young 
man had perceived and addressed himself to her 
brother. He came forward with an extended 
hand, Nick greeted him and said it was a happy 
chance he was uncommonly glad to see him. 

"I never come across you I don t know 
why, Nick remarked, while the two, smiling, 
looked each other up and down, like men reunited 
after n long interval. 

"Oh, it seems to me there s reason enough: 
our paths in life are so different." Nick s, friend 
had a great deal of manner, as was evinced by 
his fashion of saluting her without knowing her. 

"Different, yes, but not so different as that. 
Don t we both live in London, after all, and in 
the nineteenth century ? " 

" Ah, my dear Dormer, excuse me : I don t 
live in the nineteenth century. Jamais de la 
vie ! " 

" Nor in London, either ? " 

" Yes when I m not in Samarcand ! But 



26 T1JE TRAGIC MUSK. 

surely we ve diverged since the old days. I 
adore what you burn ; you burn what I adore." 
While, the stranger spoke he looked cheerfully, 
hospitably, at Biddy ; not because it was she, she 
easily guessed, but because it was in his nature to 
desire a second auditor a kind of sympathetic 
gallery. Her life, somehow, was filled with shy 
people, and she immediately knew that she had 
never encountered any one who seemed so to 
know his part and recognize his cues. 

"How do you know what I adore?" Nicholas 
Dormer inquired. 

" I know well enough what you used to." 
" That s more than I do myself ; there were so 
many things." 

"Yes, there are many things many, many: 
that s what makes life so amusing." 
" Do you find it amusing ? " 
"My dear fellow, cest a se tordre. Don t you 
think so ? Ah, it was high time I should meet 
you I see. I have an idea you need me." 

" Upon my word, I think I do ! " Nick said, in 
a tone which struck his sister and made her won 
der still more why, if the gentleman was so im 
portant as that, he did n t introduce him. 

" There are many gods, and this is one of their 
temples," the mysterious personage went on. 
" It s a house of strange idols is n t it ? and 
of some curious and unnatural sacrifices." 

To Biddy, as much as to her brother, this re 
mark appeared to be offered ; but the girl s eyes 



 2J 

turned back to the ladies, who, for the moment, 
had lost their companion. She felt irresponsive 
and feared she should pass with this familiar cos 
mopolite for a stiff, scared English girl, which 
was not the type she aimed at ; but there seemed 
an interdiction even of ocular commerce so long 
as she had not a sign from Nick. The elder of 
the strange women had turned her back and was 
looking at some bronze figure, losing her shawl 
again as she did so ; but the other stood where 
their escort had quitted her, giving all her atten 
tion to his sudden sociability with others. Her 
arms hung at her sides, her head was bent, her 
face lowered, so that she had an odd appearance 
of raising her eyes from under her brows ; and in 
this attitude she was striking, though ner air was 
uncorciliatory, almost dangerous. Did it express 
resentment at having been abandoned for another 
girl ? Biddy, who began to be frightened 
there was a moment when the forsaken one re 
sembled a tigress about to spring was tempted 
to cry out that she had no wish whatever to ap 
propriate the gentleman. Then she made the 
discovery that the young lady had a manner, al 
most as much as her cicerone, and the rapid in 
duction that it perhaps meant no more than his. 
She only looked at Biddy from beneath her eye 
brows, which were wonderfully arched, but there 
was a manner in the way she^did it. Biddy had 
a momentary sense of being a figure in a ballet, a 
dramatic ballet a subordinate, motionless figure, 



28  

to be dashed at, to music, or capered up to. It 
would be a very dramatic ballet indeed if this 
young person were the heroine. She had mag 
nificent hair, the girl reflected ; and at the same 
moment she heard Nick say to his interlocutor, 
" You re not in London one can t meet you 
there ? " 

" I drift, I float," was the answer ; " my feel 
ings direct me if such a life as mine may be 
said to have a direction. Where there s any 
thing to feel I try to be there ! " the young man 
continued, with his confiding laugh. 

"I should like to get hold of you," Nick re 
marked. 

" Well, in that case there would be something 
to feel. Those are the currents any sort of 
personal relation that govern my career/ 

" I don t want to lose you this time," Nick con 
tinued, in a manner that excited Biddy s surprise. 
A moment before, when his friend had said that 
he tried to be where there was anything to feel, 
she had wondered how he could endure him. 

" Don t lose me, don t lose me ! " exclaimed 
the stranger, with a countenance and a tone which 
affected the girl as the highest expression of 
irresponsibility that she had ever seen. " After 
all, why should you ? Let us remain together, 
unless I interfere" and he looked, smiling and 
interrogative, at Biddy, who still remained blank, 
only observing again that Nick forbore to make 
them acquainted. This was an anomaly, since he 



 2$ 

prized the gentleman so ; but there could be no 
anomaly of Nick s that would not impose itself 
upon his younger sister. 

"Certainly, I keep you," said Nick, " unless, 
on my side, I deprive those ladies " 

" Charming women, but it s not an indissolu 
ble union. We meet, we communicate, we part ! 
They are going I am seeing them to the door. 
I shall come back." With this Nick s friend 
rejoined his companions, who moved away with 
him, the strange, fine eyes of the gin lingering 
on Nick, as well as on Biddy, as they receded. 

"Who is he who are they?" Biddy instantly 
asked. 

"He s a gentleman," Nick replied, unsatisfac 
torily, and even, as she thought, with a shade of 
hesitation. He spoke as if she might have sup 
posed he was not one ; and if he was really one 
why did n t he introduce him ? But Biddy would 
not for the world have put this question to her 
brother, who now moved to the nearest bench 
and dropped upon it, as if to wait for the other s 
return. No sooner, however, had his sister seated 
herself than he said, " See here, my dear, do you 
think you had better stay ? " 

" Do you want me to go back to mother ? " 
the girl asked, with a lengthening visage. 

"Well, what do you think ? " and Nick smiled 
down at her. 

" Is your conversation to be about about 
private affairs ? " 



3&lt;D  

"No, I can t say that. But I doubt whether 
mother would think it the sort of thing that s 
necessary to your development. 

This assertion appeared to inspire Biddy with 
the eagerness with which again she broke out : 
" But who are they who are they ? " 

" I know nothing of the ladies. I never saw 
them before. The man s a fellow I knew very 
well at Oxford. He was thought immense fun 
there. We have diverged, as he says, and I had 
almost lost sight of him, but not so much as he 
thinks, because I ve read him, and read him with 
interest. He has written a very clever book." 

"What kind of a book?" 

" A sort of a novel." 

" What sort of a novel ? " 

" Well, I don t know with a lot of good 
writing." Biddy listened to this with so much 
interest that she thought it illogical her brother 
should add, " I dare say Peter will have come, if 
you return to mother." 

" I don t care if he has. Peter s nothing to 
me. But I 11 go if you wish it." 

Nick looked down at her again, and then said, 
" It does n t signify. We 11 all go." 

" All ? " Biddy echoed. 

" He won t hurt us. On the contrary, he 11 do 
us good." 

This was possible, the girl reflected in silence, 
but none the less the idea struck her as coura 
geous the idea of their taking the odd young 



 31 

man back to breakfast with them and with the 
others, especially if Peter should be there. If 
Peter was nothing to her, it was singular she 
should have attached such importance to this 
contingency. The odd young man reappeared, 
and now that she saw him without his queer 
female appendages he seemed personally less 
unusual. He struck her, moreover, as generally 
a good deal accounted for by the literary char 
acter, especially if it were responsible for a lot 
of good writing. As he took his place on the 
bench Nick said to him, indicating her, " My 
sister Bridget," and then mentioned his name, 
"Mr. Gabriel Nash." 

"You enjoy Paris you are happy here?" 
Mr. Nash inquired, leaning over his friend to 
speak to the girl. 

Though his words belonged to the situation it 
struck her that his tone did n t, and this made 
her answer him more dryly than she usually 
spoke. "Oh, yes, it s very nice." 

" And French art interests you ? You find 
things here that please ? " 

" Oh, yes, I like some of them." 

Mr. Nash looked at her with kind eyes. " I 
hoped you would say you like the Academy 
better." 

" She would if she did n t think you expected 
it," said Nicholas Dormer. 

" Oh, Nick ! " Biddy protested. 

"Miss Dormer is herself an English picture," 



32  

Gabriel Nash remarked, smiling like a man whose 
urbanity was a solvent. 

" That s a compliment, if you don t like them ! " 
Biddy exclaimed. 

"Ah, some of them, some of them ; there s 
a certain sort of thing ! " Mr. Nash continued. 
"We must feel everything, everything that we 
can. We are here for that." 

" You do like English art, then ? " Nick de 
manded, with a slight accent of surprise. 

Mr. Nash turned his srnile upon him. " My 
dear Dormer, do you remember the old complaint 
I used to make of you ? You had formulas that 
were like walking in one s hat. One may see 
something in a case, and one may not." 

"Upon my word," said Nick, "I don t know 
any one who was fonder of a generalization than 
you. You turned them off as the man at the 
street-corner distributes handbills." 

" They were my wild oats. I ve sown them 
all." 

" We shall see that ! " 

"Oh, they re nothing now a tame, scanty, 
homely growth. My only generalizations are my 
actions." 

" We shall see them, then." 

" Ah, excuse me. You can t see them with the 
naked eye. Moreover, mine are principally nega 
tive. People s actions, I know, are, for the most 
part, the things they do, but mine are all the 
things I don t do. There are so many of those, 



 33 

so many, but they don t produce any effect. And 
then all the rest are shades extremely fine 
shades." 

" Shades of behavior? " Nick inquired, with an 
interest which surprised his sister ; Mr. Nash s 
discourse striking her mainly as the twaddle of 
the under-world. 

" Shades of impression, of appreciation," said 
the young man, with his explanatory smile. " My 
only behavior is my feelings." 

"Well, don t you show your feelings? You 
used to ! " 

" Was n t it mainly those of disgust ? " Nash 
asked. Those operate no longer, i have closed 
that window." 

" Do you mean you like everything ? " 
" Dear me, no ! But I look only at what I do 
like." 

" DC you mean that you have lost the faculty 
of displeasure ? " 

" I have n t the least idea. I never try it. My 
dear fellow," said Gabriel Nash, " we have only 
one life that we know anything about : fancy tak 
ing it up with disagreeable impressions ! When, 
then, shall we go in for the agreeable ? " 

" What do you mean by the agreeable ? " Nick 
Dormer asked. 

" Oh, the happy moments of our consciousness 
the multiplication of those moments. We 
must save as many as possible from the dark 
gulf." 



34  

Nick had excited a certain astonishment on the 
part of his sister, but it was now Biddy s turn to 
make him open his eyes a little. She raised her 
sweet voice and inquired of Mr. Nash : 

" Don t you think there are any wrongs in the 
world any abuses and sufferings ? " 

" Oh, so many, so many ! That s why one 
must choose." 

"Choose to stop them, to reform them isn t 
that the choice ? " Biddy asked. " That s Nick s," 
she added, blushing, and looking at this person 
age. 

"Ah, our divergence yes!" sighed Gabriel 
Nash. " There are all kinds of machinery for 
that very complicated and ingenious. Your 
formulas, my dear Dormer, your formulas ! " 

" Hang em, I have n t got any ! " Nick ex 
claimed. 

"To me, personally, the simplest ways are those 
that appeal most," Mr. Nash went on. " We pay 
too much attention to the ugly ; we notice it, we 
magnify it. The great thing is to leave it alone 
and encourage the beautiful." 

" You must be very sure you get hold of the 
beautiful," said Nick. 

"Ah, precisely, and that s just the importance 
of the faculty of appreciation. We must train 
our special sense. It is capable of extraordinary 
extension. Life s none too long for that." 

" But what s the good of the extraordinary ex 
tension if there is no affirmation of it, if it all 



 35 

goes to the negative, as you say ? Where are the 
fine consequences ? " Dormer asked. 

" In one s own spirit. One is one s self a fine 
consequence. That s the most important one we 
have to do with, /am a fine consequence," said 
Gabriel Nash. 

Biddy rose from the bench at this, and stepped 
away a little, as if to look at a piece of statuary. 
But she had not gone far before, pausing and 
turning, she bent her eyes upon Mr. Nash with 
a heightened color, an air of hesitation and the 
question, after a moment, " Are you then an 
aesthete?" 

" Ah, there s one of the formulas ! That s 
walking in one s hat ! I ve no profession, my 
dear young lady. I Ve no etat civil. These 
thing.; are a part of the complicated, ingenious 
machinery. As I say, I keep to the simplest way. 
I find that gives one enough to do. Merely to 
be is such a metier ; to live is such an art ; to feel 
is such a career ! " 

Bridget Dormer turned her back and examined 
her statue, and her brother said to his old friend, 
"And to write?" 

" To write ? Oh, I 11 never do it again ! " 

" You have done it almost well enough to be 
inconsistent. That book of yours is anything 
but negative ; it s complicated and ingenious." 

" My dear fellow, I ra extremely ashamed of 
it," said Gabriel Nash. 

" Ah, call yourself a bloated Buddhist and have 
done with it ! " his companion exclaimed. 



36  

" Have done with it ? I have n t the least de 
sire for that. And why should one call one s self 
anything ? One only deprives other people of 
their dearest occupation. Let me add that you 
don t begin to have an insight into the art of life 
till it ceases to be of the smallest consequence 
to you what you may be called. That s rudi 
mentary." 

" But if you go in for shades, you must also go 
in for names. You must distinguish," Dormer 
objected. " The observer is nothing without his 
categories, his types and varieties." 

" Ah, trust him to distinguish ! " said Gabriel 
Nash, sweetly. " That s for his own conven 
ience ; he has, privately, a terminology to meet it. 
That s one s style. But from the moment it s 
for the convenience of others, the signs have to 
be grosser, the shades begin to go. That s a de 
plorable hour ! Literature, you see, is for the 
convenience of others. It requires the most ab 
ject concessions. It plays such mischief with 
one s style that really I have had to give it up." 

" And politics ? " Nick Dormer asked. 

" Well, what about them ? " was Mr. Nash s 
reply, in a peculiar intonation, as he watched his 
friend s sister, who was still examining her statue. 
Biddy was divided between irritation and curi 
osity. She had interposed space, but she had 
not gone beyond ear-shot. Nick s question made 
her curiosity throb, especially in its second form, 
as a rejoinder to their companion s. 



 37 

" That, no doubt you 11 say, is still far more 
for the convenience of others is still worse for 
one s style." 

Biddy turned round in time to hear Mr. Nash 
exclaim, " It has simply nothing in life to do with 
shades ! I can t say worse for it than that." 

Biddy stepped nearer at this, and, drawing still 
further on her courage, " Won t mamma be wait 
ing ? Ought n t we to go to luncheon ? " she 
asked. 

Both the young men looked up at her, and Mr. 
Nash remarked, 

" You ought to protest ! You ought to save 
him ! " 

" To save him ? " said Biddy. 

" He had a style ; upon my word, he had ! But 
I ve seen it go. I ve read his speeches." 

" You were capable of that ? " Dormer de 
manded. 

" For you, yes. But it was like listening to a 
nightingale in a brass band." 

" I think they were beautiful," Biddy declared. 

Her brother got up at this tribute, and Mr. 
Nash, rising too, said, with his bright, colloquial 
air, 

" But, Miss Dormer, he had eyes. He was 
made to see to see all over, to see everything. 
There are so few like that." 

" I think he still sees," Biddy rejoined, won 
dering a little why Nick didn t defend himself. 

" He sees his side, dear young lady. Poor man, 



38  

fancy your having a side - you, you and 
spending your days and your nights looking at 
it ! I d as soon pass my life looking at an ad 
vertisement on a boarding." 

" You don t see me some day a great states 
man ? " said Nick. 

" My dear fellow, it s exactly what I ve a ter 
ror of." 

" Mercy ! don t you admire them ? " Biddy 
cried. 

" It s a trade like another, and a method of 
making one s way which society certainly con 
dones. But when one can be something bet 
ter ! " 

"Dear me, what is better?" Biddy asked. 

The young man hesitated, and Nick, replying 
for him, said 

" Gabriel Nash is better ! You must come 
and lunch with us. I must keep you I must ! " 
he added. 

" We shall save him yet," Mr. Nash observed 
genially to Biddy as they went, and the girl won 
dered still more what her mother would make of 
him. 



III. 

AFTER her companions left her, Lady Agnes 
rested for five minutes in silence with her elder 
daughter, at the end of which time she observed, 
" I suppose one must have food, at any rate," 
and, getting up, quitted the place where they had 
been sitting. " And where are we to go ? I 
hate eating out-of-doors," she went on. 

" Dear me, when one comes to Paris ? " Grace 
rejoined, in a tone which appeared to imply that 
in so rash an adventure one must be prepared for 
compromises and concessions. The two ladies 
wandered to where they saw a large sign of 
" Buffet" suspended in the air, entering a pre 
cinct reserved for little white-clothed tables, 
straw-covered chairs, and long-aproned waiters. 
One of these functionaries approached them with 
eagerness, and with a " Mesdames sont seules ? " 
receiving in return, from her ladyship, the 
slightly snappish announcement, " Non ; nous 
sommes beaucoup ! " He introduced them to a 
table larger than most of the others, and under 
his protection they took their places at it and be 
gan, rather languidly and vaguely, to consider the 
question of the repast. The waiter had placed a 
carte in Lady Agnes s hands, and she studied it, 



4O  

through her eyeglass, with a failure of interest, 
while he enumerated, with professional fluency, 
the resources of the establishment, and Grace 
looked at the people at the other tables. She 
was hungry, and had already broken a morsel 
from a long glazed roll. 

" Not cold beef and pickles, you know," she 
observed to her mother. Lady Agnes gave no 
heed to this profane remark, but she dropped her 
eyeglass and laid down the greasy document 
" What does it signify ? I dare say it s all 
nasty," Grace continued ; and she added, incon- 
sequently, " If Peter comes, he s sure to be par 
ticular." 

" Let him be particular to come, first ! " her 
ladyship exclaimed, turning a cold eye upon the 
waiter. 

"Poulet chasseur, filets mignons, sauce bear- 
naise," the man suggested. 

" You will give us what I tell you," said Lady 
Agnes, and she mentioned, with distinctness and 
authority, the dishes of which she desired that 
the meal should be composed. He interposed 
three or four more suggestions, but as they pro 
duced absolutely no impression on her he became 
silent and submissive, doing justice, apparently, 
to her ideas. For Lady Agnes had ideas ; and 
though it had suited her humor, ten minutes be 
fore, to profess herself helpless in such a case, 
the manner in which she imposed them upon 
the waiter as original, practical and economical 



 4! 

showed the high, executive woman, the mother of 
children, the daughter of earls, the consort of an 
official, the dispenser of hospitality, looking back 
upon a lifetime of luncheons. She carried many 
cares, and the feeding of multitudes (she was 
honorably conscious of having fed them decently, 
as she had always done everything) had ever 
been one of them. " Everything is absurdly 
dear," she remarked to her daughter, as the 
waiter went away. To this remark Grace made 
no answer. She had been used, for a long time 
back, to hearing that everything was very dear ; 
it was what one always expected. So she found 
the case herself, but she was silent and inventive 
about it. 

Nothing further passed, in the way of conver 
sation with her mother, while they waited for the 
latter t, orders to be executed, till Lady Agnes 
reflected, audibly : " He makes me unhappy, the 
way he talks about Julia." 

" Sometimes I think he does it to torment one. 
One can t mention her ! " Grace responded. 

" It s better not to mention her, but to leave it 
alone." 

"Yet he never mentions her of himself." 

" In some cases that is supposed to show that 
people like people though of course something 
more than that is required," Lady Agnes con 
tinued to meditate. &lt;l Sometimes I think he s 
thinking of her ; then at others I can t fancy 
what he s thinking of." 



42  

" It would be awfully suitable," said Grace, 
biting her roll. 

Her mother was silent a moment, as if she 
were looking for some higher ground to put it 
upon. Then she appeared to find this loftier 
level in the observation. " Of course he must 
like her ; he has known her always." 

" Nothing can be plainer than that she likes 
him," Grace declared. 

" Poor Julia ! " Lady Agnes exclaimed : and 
her tone suggested that she knew more about 
that than she was ready to state. 

" It is n t as if she was n t clever and well 
read," her daughter went on. " If there were 
nothing else, there would be a reason in her be 
ing so interested in politics, in everything that 
he is." 

"Ah, what he is that s what I sometimes 
wonder ! " 

Grace Dormer looked at her mother a moment. 
" Why, mother, is n t he going to be like papa ? " 
She waited for an answer that did n t come ; after 
which she pursued, " I thought you thought him 
so like him already." 

" Well, I don t," said Lady Agnes quietly. 

" Who is, then ? Certainly Percy is n t." 

Lady Agnes was silent a moment. " There is 
no one like your father." 

" Dear papa ! " Grace exclaimed. Then, with a 
rapid transition, " It would be so jolly for all of 
us ; she would be so nice to us." 



 43 

"She is that already, in her way," said Lady 
Agnes, conscientiously, having followed the re 
turn, quick as it was. "Much good does it do 
her ! " And she reproduced the note of her ejac 
ulation of a moment before. 

" It does her some, if one looks out for her. I 
do, and I think She knows it," Grace declared. 
" One can, at any rate, keep other women off." 

" Don t meddle ! you re very clumsy," was her 
mother s not particularly sympathetic rejoinder. 
" There are other women who are beautiful, and 
there are others who are clever and rich." 

" Yes, but not all in one ; that s what s so nice 
in Julia. Her fortune would be thrown in ; he 
would n t appear to have married her for it." 

" If le does, he won t," said Lady Agnes, a 
trifle obscurely. 

" Yes, that s what s so charming. And he 
could do anything then, could n t he ? " 

"Well, your father had no fortune, to speak 
of." 

"Yes, but did n t uncle Percy help him ? " 

" His wife helped him," said Lady Agnes. 

" Dear mamma ! " the girl exclaimed. " There s 
one thing," she added: "that Mr. Carteret will 
always help Nick." 

" What do you mean by always ? " 

"Why, whether he marries Julia or not." 

"Things are not so easy," responded Lady 
Agnes. " It will all depend on Nick s behavior. 
He can stop it to-morrow." 



44  

Grace Dormer stared ; she evidently thought 
Mr. Carteret s beneficence a part of the scheme 
of nature. " How could he stop it ? " 

" By not being serious. It is n t so hard to 
prevent people giving you money." 

" Serious ? " Grace repeated. " Does he want 
him to be a prig, like Lord Egbert ? " 

" Yes, he does. And what he 11 do for him 
he 11 do for him only if he marries Julia." 

" Has he told you ? " Grace inquired. And 
then, before her mother could answer, she ex 
claimed, " I m delighted at that ! " 

" He has n t told me, but that s the way things 
happen." Lady Agnes was less optimistic than 
her daughter, and such optimism as she cultivated 
was a thin tissue with the sense of things as 
they are showing through it. " If Nick becomes 
rich, Charles Carteret will make him more so. 
If he does n t, he won t give him a shilling." 

" Oh, mamma ! " Grace protested. 

" It s all very well to say that in public life 
money is n t necessary, as it used to be," her 
ladyship went on, broodingly. " Those who say 
so don t know anything about it. It s always 
necessary." 

Her daughter was visibly affected by the 
gloom of her manner, and felt impelled to evoke, 
as a corrective, a more cheerful idea. " I dare 
say ; but there s the fact is n t there ? that 
poor papa had so little." 

" Yes, and there s the fact that it killed him ! " 



THE TRAGIC ML T SE, 45 

These words came out with a strange, quick 
little flare of passion. They startled Grace Dor 
mer, who jumped in her place, and cried, " Oh, 
mother ! " The next instant, however, she 
added, in a different voice, " Oh, Peter ! " for, 
with an air of eagerness, a gentleman was walk 
ing up to them. 

" How d ye do, cousin Agnes ? How d ye do, 
little Grace ? " Peter Sherringham said, laugh 
ing and shaking hands with them ; and three 
minutes later he was settled in his chair at their 
table, on which the first elements of the repast 
had been placed. Explanations, on one side and 
the other, were demanded and produced ; from 
which it appeared that the two parties had been 
in some degree at cross-purposes. The day be 
fore L dy Agnes and her companions traveled to 
Paris, Sherringham had gone to London for 
forty-eight hours, on private business of the am 
bassador s, arriving, on his return by the night- 
train, only early that morning. There had ac 
cordingly been a delay in his receiving Nick Dor 
mer s two notes. If Nick had come to the 
Embassy in person (he might have done him the 
honor to call), he would have learned that the 
second secretary was absent. Lady Agnes was 
not altogether successful in assigning a motive 
to her son s neglect of this courteous form ; she 
said, "I expected him, I wanted him, to go; and 
indeed, not hearing from you, he would have 
gone immediately an hour or two hence, .on 



46  

leaving this place. But we are here so quietly, 
not to go out, not to seem to appeal to the am 
bassador. He said, Oh, mother, we 11 keep out 
of it ; a friendly note will do. I don t know, 
definitely, what he wanted to keep out of, except 
it s anything like gayety. The Embassy is n t 
gay, I know. But I m sure his note was friendly, 
was n t it ? I dare say you 11 see for yourself ; 
he s different directly he gets abroad; he does 
n t seem to care." Lady Agnes paused a mo 
ment, not carrying out this particular elucidation ; 
then she resumed: "He said you would have 
seen Julia, and that you would understand every 
thing from her. And when I asked how she 
would know, he said, * Oh, she knows every 
thing ! " 

" He never said a word to me about Julia," 
Peter Sherringham rejoined. Lady Agnes and 
i her daughter exchanged a glance at this ; the 
latter had already asked three times where Julia 
was, and her ladyship dropped that they had been 
hoping she would be able to come with Peter. 
The young man set forth that she was at that 
moment at an hotel in the Rue de la Paix, but 
had only been there since that morning ; he had 
seen her before coming to the Champs Elysees. 
She had come up to Paris by an early train 
she had been staying at Versailles, of all places 
in the world.. She had been a week in Paris, on 
her return from Cannes (her stay there had been 
of nearly a month, fancy !), and then had gone 



 47 

out to Versailles to see Mrs. Billinghurst Per 
haps they would remember her, poor Dallow s 
sister. She was staying there to teach her 
daughters French (she had a dozen or two !), and 
Julia had spent three days with her. She was to 
return to England about the 25th. It would 
make seven weeks that she would have been 
away from town a rare thing for her ; she usu 
ally stuck to it so in summer. 

" Three days with Mrs. Billinghurst how 
very good-natured of her ! " Lady Agnes com 
mented. 

" Oh, they re very nice to her," Sherringham 
said. 

" Well, I hope so ! " Grace Dormer qualified. 
" Why lid n t you make her come here ? " 

" I proposed it, but she would n t." Another 
eye-beam, at this, passed between the two ladies, 
and Peter went on : " She said you must come 
and see her, at the Hotel de Hollande." 

"Of course we ll do that," Lady Agnes de 
clared. " Nick went to ask about her at the 
Westminster." 

" She gave that up ; they would n t give her 
the rooms she wanted, her usual set." 

"She s delightfully particular!" Grace mur 
mured. Then she added, " She does like pic 
tures, does n t she ? " 

Peter Sherringham stared. "Oh, I dare say. 
But that s not what she has in her head this 
morning. She has some news from London ; 
she s immensely excited," 



48  

" What has she in her head ? " Lady Agnes 
asked. 

" What s her news from London ? " Grace de 
manded. 

" She wants Nick to stand." 

" Nick to stand ? " both the ladies cried. 

" She undertakes to bring him in for Harsh. 
Mr. Pinks is dead the fellow, you know, that 
got the seat at the general election. He dropped 
down in London disease of the heart, or some 
thing of that sort. Julia has her telegram, but I 
see it was in last night s papers." 

" Imagine, Nick never mentioned it ! " said 
Lady Agnes. 

" Don t you know, mother? abroad he only 
reads foreign papers." 

" Oh, I know. I ve no patience with him," 
her ladyship continued. " Dear Julia ! " 

" It s a nasty little place, and Pinks had a 
tight sqeeze 107, or something of that sort ; 
but if it returned a Liberal a year ago, very likely 
it will do so again. Julia, at any rate, se fait 
forte, as they say here, to put him in." 

" I m sure if she can she will," Grace re 
flected. 

" Dear, dear Julia ! And Nick can do some 
thing for himself," said the mother of this candi 
date. 

" I have no doubt he can do anything," Peter 
Sherringham returned, good-naturedly. Then, 
" Do you mean in expenses ? " he inquired. 



 49 

" Ah, I m afraid he can t do much in expenses, 
poor dear boy ! And it s dreadful, how little we 
can look to Percy." 

" Well, I dare say you may look to Julia. I 
think that s her idea." 

"Delightful Julia!" Lady Agnes ejaculated. 
" If poor Sir Nicholas could have known ! Of 
course he must go straight home," she added. 

" He won t like that," said Grace. 

"Then he ll have to go without liking it." 

" It will rather spoil your little excursion, if 
you ve only just come," Peter suggested; "and 
the great Biddy s, if she s enjoying Paris." 

" We may stay, perhaps with Julia to protect 
us," said Lady Agnes. 

" Ah, she won t stay ; she 11 go over for her 
man." 

" Her man ? " 

" The fellow that stands, whoever he is ; es 
pecially if he s Nick." These last words caused 
the eyes of Peter Sherringham s companions to 
meet again, and he went on : " She 11 go straight 
down to Harsh." 

" Wonderful Julia ! " Lady Agnes panted. " Of 
course Nick must go straight there, too." 

"Well, I suppose he must see first if they 11 
have him." 

" If they 11 have him ? Why, how can he tell 
till he tries ? " 

"I mean the people at headquarters, the fel 
lows who arrange it." 



50  

Lady Agnes colored a little. " My dear Peter, 
do you suppose there will be the least doubt of 
their having the son of his father ?" 

" Of course it s a great name, cousin Agnes 
a very great name." 

" One of the greatest, simply," said Lady Agnes, 
smiling. 

" It s the best name in the world ! " Grace 
Dormer subjoined. 

" All the same it did n t prevent his losing his 
seat." 

" By half a dozen votes : it was too odious ! " 
her ladyship cried. 

" I remember I remember. And in such a 
case as that why did n t they immediately put 
him in somewhere else ? " 

" How one sees that you live abroad, Peter ! 
There happens to have been the most extraor 
dinary lack of openings I never saw anything 
like it for a year. They ve had their hand on 
him, keeping him all ready. I dare say they ve 
telegraphed to him." 

" And he has n t told you ? " 

Lady Agnes hesitated. " He s so odd when 
he s abroad ! " 

"At home, too, he lets things go," Grace in 
terposed. " He does so little takes no trou 
ble." Her mother suffered this statement to 
pass unchallenged, and she pursued, philosophi 
cally, " I suppose it s because he knows he s 
so clever." 



 51 

" So he is, dear old boy. But what does he do, 
what has he been doing, in a positive way ? " 

" He has been painting." 

" Ah, not seriously ! " Lady Agnes protested. 

" That s the worst way," said Peter Sherring- 
ham. " Good things ? " 

Neither of the ladies made a direct response to 
this, but Lady Agnes said, " He has spoken re 
peatedly. They are always calling on him." 

"He speaks magnificently," Grace attested. 

" That s another of the things I lose, living 
in far countries. And he s doing the Salon, now, 
with great Biddy ? " 

" Just the things in this part. I can t think 
what keeps them so long," Lady Agnes rejoined. 
" Did you ever see such a dreadful place ? " 

Sherringham stared. " Are n t the things 
good ? I had an idea" 

" Good ? " cried Lady Agnes. " They re too 
odious, too wicked." 

"Ah," said Peter, laughing, "that s what peo 
ple fall into, if they live abroad. The French 
ought n t to live abroad ! " 

"Here they come," Grace announced, at this 
point ; " but they ve got a strange man with 
them." 

" That s a bore, when we want to talk ! " Lady 
Agnes sighed. 

Peter got up, in the spirit of welcome, and 
stood a moment watching the others approach. 



52  

"-There will be no difficulty in talking, to judge 
by the gentleman," he suggested ; and while he 
remains so conspicuous our eyes may rest on 
him briefly. He was middling high and was vis 
ibly a representative of the nervous rather than 
of the phlegmatic branch of his race. He had 
an oval face, fine, firm features and a complex 
ion that tended to the brown. Brown were his 
eyes, and women thought them soft ; dark brown 
his hair, in which the same critics sometimes re 
gretted the absence of a little undulation. It was 
perhaps to conceal this plainness that he wore it 
very short. His teeth were white ; his moustache 
was pointed, and so was the small beard that 
adorned the extremity of his chin. His face ex 
pressed intelligence and was very much alive, 
and had the further distinction that it often 
struck superficial observers with a certain for- 
eignness of cast. The deeper sort, however, 
usually perceived that it was English enough. 
There was an idea that, having taken up the 
diplomatic career and gone to live in strange 
lands, he cultivated the mask of an alien, an 
Italian or a Spaniard ; of an alien in time, even 
one of the wonderful ubiquitous diplomatic 
agents of the sixteenth century. In fact, it would 
have been impossible to be more modern than 
Peter Sherringham, and more of one s class and 
one s country. But this did not prevent a por 
tion of the community Bridget Dormer, for in- 



 53 

stance from admiring the hue of his cheek for 
its olive richness and his moustache and beard 
for their resemblance to those of Charles I. At 
the same time she rather jumbled her com 
parisons she thought he looked like a Titian. 



IV. 

PETER S meeting with Nick was of the friend 
liest on both sides, involving a great many " dear 
fellows " and " old boys," and his salutation to 
the younger of the Miss Dormers consisted of 
the frankest " Delighted to see you, my dear 
Bid ! " There was no kissing, but there was 
cousinship in the air, of a conscious, living kind, 
as Gabriel Nash no doubt quickly perceived, hov 
ering for a moment outside the group. Biddy said 
nothing to Peter Sherringham, but there was no 
flatness in a silence which afforded such oppor 
tunities for a pretty smile. Nick introduced Ga 
briel Nash to his mother and to the other two as 
" a delightful old friend," whom he had just come 
across, and Sherringham acknowledged the act 
by saying to Mr. Nash, but as if rather less for 
his sake than for that of the presenter, " I have 
seen you very often before." 

" Ah, repetition recurrence : we have n t yet, 
in the study of how to live, abolished that clum 
siness, have we ? " Mr. Nash genially inquired. 
" It s a poverty in the supernumeraries that we 
don t pass once for all, but come round and cross 
again, like a procession at the theatre. It s a 
shabby economy that ought to have been man- 



 55 

aged better, The right thing would be just one 
appearance, and the procession, regardless of ex 
pense, forever and forever different." 

The company was occupied in placing itself at 
table, so that the only disengaged attention, for 
the moment, was Grace s, to whom, as her eyes 
rested on him, the young man addressed these 
last words with a smile. "Alas, it s a very shabby 
idea, is n t it ? The world is n t got up regard 
less of expense ! " 

Grace looked quickly away from him, and said 
to her brother, " Nick, Mr. Pinks is dead." 

" Mr. Pinks ? " asked Gabriel Nash, appearing 
to wonder where he should sit. 

" The member for Harsh ; and Julia wants 
yon to otand," the girl went on. 

" Mr. Pinks, the member for Harsh ? What 
names, to be sure!" Gabriel mused cheerfully, 
still unseated. 

"Julia wants me ? I m much obliged to her ! " 
observed Nicholas Dormer. " Nash, please sit 
by my mother, with Peter on her other side." 

" My clear, it is n t Julia," Lady Agnes re 
marked, earnestly, to her son. " Every one wants 
you. Have n t you heard from your people ? 
Did n t you know the seat was vacant ? " 

Nick was looking round the table, to see what 
was on it. " Upon my word, I don t remember. 
What else have you ordered, mother ? " 

" There s some bceuf brais^ my dear, and after 
wards some galantine. Here is a dish of eggs 
with asparagus-tips." 



56 THE TKAGIC MUSE. 

" I advise you to go in for it, Nick," said Peter 
Sherringham, to whom the preparation in ques 
tion was presented. 

"Into the eggs with asparagus-tips? Donnez 
m en, s il vous plait. My dear fellow, how can I 
stand ? how can I sit ? Where s the money to 
come from ? " 

" The money ? Why from Jul " Grace be 
gan, but immediately caught her mother s eye. 

" Poor Julia, how you do work her ! " Nick 
exclaimed. " Nash, I recommend you the aspar 
agus-tips. Mother, he s my best friend ; do look 
after him." 

" I have an impression I have breakfasted I 
am not sure," Nash observed. 

" With those beautiful ladies ? Try again ; 
you ll find out." 

" The money can be managed ; the expenses 
are very small, and the seat is certain," Lady 
Agnes declared, not, apparently, heeding her son s 
injunction in respect to Nash. 

" Rather if Julia goes down ! " her elder 
daughter exclaimed. 

" Perhaps Julia won t go down ! " Nick an 
swered, humorously. 

Biddy was seated next to Mr. Nash, so that 
she could take occasion to ask, " Who are the 
beautiful ladies?" as if she failed to recognize 
her brother s allusion. In reality this was an 
innocent trick : she was more curious than she 
could have given a suitable reason for about the 



 $? 

odd women from whom her neighbor had sepa 
rated. 

"Deluded, misguided, infatuated persons! 
Gabriel Nash replied, understanding that she 
had asked for a description. " Strange, eccentric, 
almost romantic types. Predestined victims, 
simple-minded sacrificial lambs ! " 

This was copious, yet it was vague, so that 
Biddy could only respond, "Oh!" But mean 
while Peter Sherringham said to Nick, "Julia s 
here, you know. You must go and see her." 

Nick looked at him for an instant rather hard, 
as if to say, " You too ? " But Peter s eyes ap 
peared to answer, " No, no, not I ; " upon which 
his cousin rejoined, " Of course I 11 go and see 
her. I 11 go immediately. Please to thank her 
for thinking of me." 

"Thinking of you ? There are plenty to think 
of you ! Lady Agnes said. " There are sure to 
be telegrams at home. We must go back we 
must go back ! " 

" We must go back to England ? " Nick Dor 
mer asked ; and as his mother made no answer 
he continued, "Do you mean I must go to 
Harsh ? " 

Her ladyship evaded this question, inquiring of 
Mr. Nash if he would have a morsel of fish ; but 
her gain was small, for this gentleman, struck 
again by the unhappy name of the bereaved con 
stituency, only broke out, "Ah, what a place to 
represent ! How can you how can you ? " 



58  

" It s an excellent place," said Lady Agnes, 
coldly. "I imagine you have never been there. 
It s a very good place indeed. It belongs very 
largely to my cousin, Mrs. Dallow." 

Gabriel partook of the fish, listening with inter 
est. " But I thought we had no more pocket- 
boroughs." 

"It s pockets we rather lack, so many of us. 
There are plenty of Harshes," Nick Dormer ob 
served. 

" I don t know what you mean," Lady Agnes 
said to Gabriel, with considerable majesty. 

Peter Sherringham also addresssd him with an 
" Oh, it s all right ; they come down on you like 
a shot ! " and the young man continued ingenu 
ously 

" Do you mean to say you have to pay to get 
into that place that it s not you that are 
paid ? " 

"Into that place?" Lady Agnes repeated, 
blankly. 

" Into the House of Commons. That you 
don t get a high salary ? " 

" My dear Nash, you re delightful : don t leave 
me don t leave me!" Nick cried; while his 
mother looked at him with an eye that demanded, 
" Who is this extraordinary person ? " 

" What then did you think pocket-boroughs 
were ? " Peter Sherringham asked. 

Mr. Nash s facial radiance rested on him. 
" Why, boroughs that filled your pocket. To do 



 59 

that sort of thing without a bribe cest trop 
fort!" 

"He lives at Samarcand," Nick Dormer ex 
plained to his mother, who colored perceptibly. 
" What do you advise me ? I 11 do whatever you 
say," he went on to his old acquaintance. 

" My dear my dear ! " Lady Agnes pleaded. 

" See Julia first, with all respect to Mr. Nash. 
She s of excellent counsel," said Peter Sher- 
ringham. 

Gabriel Nash smiled across the table at Dor 
mer. "The lady first the lady first ! I have 
not a word to suggest as against any idea of 
hers." 

" We must not sit here too long, there will be 
so much to do," said Lady Agnes, anxiously, per 
ceiving a certain slowness in the service of the 
bceuf braist. 

Biddy had been up to this moment mainly oc 
cupied in looking, covertly and at intervals, at 
Peter Sherringham ; as was perfectly lawful in 
a young lady with a handsome cousin whom she 
had not seen for more than a year. But her 
sweet voice now took license to throw in the 
words, "We know what Mr. Nash thinks of poli 
tics : he told us just now he thinks they are 
dreadful." 

"No, not dreadful only inferior," the person 
age impugned protested. " Everything is rela 
tive." 

" Inferior to what ? " Lady Agnes demanded. 



6O  

Mr. Nash appeared to consider a moment. " To 
anything else that may be in question." 

" Nothing else is in question ! " said her lady 
ship, in a tone that would have been triumphant 
if it had not been dry. 

"Ah, then!" And her neighbor shook his 
head sadly. He turned, after this, to Biddy, and 
said to her, "The ladies whom I was with just 
now, and in whom you were so good as to express 
an interest ? " Biddy gave a sign of assent, and 
he went on : " They are persons theatrical ; the 
younger one is trying to go upon the stage." 

"And are you assisting her?" Biddy asked, 
pleased that she had guessed so nearly right. 

" Not in the least I m rather heading her 
off. I consider it the lowest of the arts." 

" Lower than politics ? " asked Peter Sherring- 
ham, who was listening to this. 

" Dear, no, I won t say that. I think the The- 
dtre Frangais a greater institution than the House 
of Commons." 

"I agree with you there !" laughed Sherring- 
ham ; " all the more that I don t consider the 
dramatic art a low one. On the contrary, it 
seems to me to include all the others." 

" Yes that s a view. I think it s the view 
of my friends." 

" Of your friends ? " 

" Two ladies old acquaintances whom I 
met in Paris a week ago, and whom I have just 
been spending an hour with in this place." 



 6 1 

" You should have seen them ; they struck me 
very much," Biddy said to her cousin. 

" I should like to see them, if they really have 
anything to say to the theatre." 

"It can easily be managed. Do you believe 
in the theatre ? " asked Gabriel Nash. 

"Passionately," Sherringham confessed. "Don t 
you ? " 

Before Nash had had time to answer, Biddy 
had interposed with a sigh : " How I wish I 
could go but in Paris I can t ! " 

" I 11 take you Biddy I vow I 11 take you." 

"But the plays, Peter," the girl objected. 
" Mamma says they re worse than the pictures." 

" Oh, we 11 arrange that : they shall do one at 
the Frangais on purpose for a delightful little 
English girl." 

" Can you make them ? " 

" I can make them do anything I choose." 

"Ah, then, it s the theatre that believes in you," 
said Gabriel Nash. 

" It would be ungrateful if it did n t ! " Peter 
Sherringham laughed. 

Lady Agnes had withdrawn herself from be 
tween him and Mr. Nash, and, to signify that she, 
at least, had finished eating, had gone to sit by 
her son, whom she held, with some importunity, 
in conversation. But hearing the theatre talked 
of, she threw across an impersonal challenge to 
the paradoxical young man. " Pray, should you 
think it better for a gentleman to be an actor ? " 



62 THE TRAGIC M ". 

" Better than being a politician ? Ah, come 
dian for comedian, is n t the actor more honest ? " 

Lady Agnes turned to her son and exclaimed 
with spirit, " Think of your great father, Nicho 
las ! " 

" He was an honest man ; that perhaps is why 
he could n t stand it." 

Peter Sherringham judged the colloquy to have 
taken an uncomfortable twist, though not wholly, 
as it seemed to him, by the act of Nick s queer 
comrade. To draw it back to safer ground he 
said to this personage : " May I ask if the ladies 
you just spoke of are English Mrs. and Miss 
Rooth : is n t that the rather odd name ? " 

" The very same. Only the daughter, accord 
ing to her kind, desires to be known by some nom 
de guerre before she has even been able to en 
list." 

" And what does she call herself ? " Bridget 
Dormer asked. 

Maud Vavasour, or Edith Temple, or Gladys 
Vane some rubbish of that sort." 

" What, then, is her own name ? " 

" Miriam Miriam Rooth. It would do very 
well and would give her the benefit of the pre 
possessing fact that (to the best of my belief, at 
least i she is more than half a Jewess." 

" It is as good as Rachel Felix," Sherringham 
said. 

" The name s as good, but not the talent The 
girl is magnificently stupid" 



 63 

" And more than half a Jewess ? Don t you 
believe it ! " Sherringham exclaimed. 

" Don t believe she s a Jewess ? " Biddy asked, 
still more interested in Miriam Rooth. 

" No, no that she s stupid, really. If she is, 
she 11 be the first." 

" Ah, you may judge for yourself," Nash re 
joined, " if you 11 come to-morrow afternoon to 
Madame Carre, Rue de Constantinople, a ren- 
tresoir 

" Madame Carre ? Why, I ve already a note 
from her I found it this morning on my return 
to Paris asking me to look in at five o clock 
and listen to ^jenne Anglais t" 

" That s my arrangement I obtained the fa 
vor. The ladies want an opinion, and dear old 
Carre has consented to see them and to give one. 
Gladys v ill recite something and the venerable 
artist wil} pass judgment." 

Sherrir.gham remembered that he had his note 
in his pocket, and he took it out and looked it 
over. " She wishes to make her a little audience 
she says she ll do better with that and she 
asks me because I m English. I shall make a 
point of going." 

"And bring Dormer if you can : the audience 
will be better. Will you come, Dormer?" Mr. 
Xash continued, appealing to his friend, "will 
you come with me to see an old French actress 
and to hear an English amateur recite ? " 

Nick looked round from his talk with his mo-

ther and Grace. " I 11 go anywhere with you, so 
that, as I ve told you, I may not lose sight of 
you, may keep hold of you." 

" Poor Mr. Nash, why is he so useful ? " Lady 
Agnes demanded with a laugh. 
" He steadies me, mother." 
" Oh, I wish you d take me, Peter," Biddy 
broke out, wistfully, to her cousin. 

" To spend an hour with an old French ac 
tress ? Do you want to go upon the stage ? " the 
young man inquired. 

" No, but I want to see something, to know 
something." 

" Madame Carre is wonderful in her way, but 
she is hardly company for a little English girl." 

" I m not little, I m only too big ; and she goes, 
the person you speak of." 

" For a professional purpose, and with her good 
mother," smiled Gabriel Nash. " I think Lady 
Agnes would hardly venture " 

" Oh, I ve seen her good mother ! " said Biddy, 
as if she had an impression of what the worth of 
that protection might be. 

" Yes, but you have n t heard her. It s then 
that you measure her." 

Biddy was wistful still. " Is it the famous 
Honorine Carre, the great celebrity ? " 

" Honorine in person : the incomparable, the 
perfect ! " said Peter Sherringham. " The first 
artist of our time, taking her altogether. She 
and I are old pals ; she has been so good as to 



 65 

come and say things, as she does sometimes 
still dans le monde, as no one else does, in my 
rooms." 

" Make her come, then ; we can go there ! " 

" One of these days ! " 

" And the young lady Miriam, Edith, Gladys 
make her come too." 

Sherringham looked at Nash and the latter ex 
claimed, " Oh, you 11 have no difficulty ; she 11 
jump at it ! " 

"Very good ; I 11 give a little artistic tea, with 
Julia, too, of course. And you must come, Mr. 
Nash." * This gentleman promised, with an in 
clination, and Peter continued : " But if, as you 
say, you re not for helping the young lady, how 
came you to arrange this interview with the great 
model ? " 

" Precisely to stop her. The great model will 
find her very bad. Her judgments, as you prob 
ably kilow, are Rhadamanthine." 

"Poor girl!" said Biddy. "I think you re 
cruel" 

" Never mind ; I 11 look after them," said Sher 
ringham. 

" And how can Madame Carre judge, if the girl 
recites English ? " 

"She s so intelligent that she could judge if 
she recited Chinese," Peter declared. 

" That s true, but the jeune Anglaise recites 
also in French," said Gabriel Nash. 

"Then she is n t stupid." 



66  

" And in Italian, and in several more tongues, 
for aught I know." 

Sherringham was visibly interested. "Very 
good ; we 11 put her through them all." 

" She must be most clever," Biddy went on, 
yearningly. 

" She has spent her life on the Continent ; she 
has wandered about with her mother ; she has 
picked up things." 

" And is she a lady ? " Biddy asked. 

" Oh, tremendous ! The great ones of the 
earth on the mother s side. On the father s, on 
the other hand, I imagine, only a Jew stockbroker 
in the city." 

" Then they re rich or ought to be," Sher 
ringham suggested. 

" Ought to be ah, there s the bitterness ! 
The stockbroker had too short a go he was 
carried off in his flower. However, he left his 
wife a certain property, which she appears to 
have muddled away, not having the safeguard of 
being herself a Hebrew. This is what she lived 
upon till to-day this and another resource. 
Her husband, as she has often told me, had the 
artistic temperament ; that s common, as you 
know, among ces messieurs. He made the most 
of his little opportunities and collected various 
pictures, tapestries, enamels, porcelains and simi 
lar gewgaws. He parted with them also, I gather, 
at a profit ; in short, he carried on a neat little 
business as a brocanteur. It was nipped in the 



 6/ 

bud, but Mrs. Rooth was left with a certain num 
ber of these articles in her hands ; indeed they 
must have constituted the most palpable part of 
her heritage. She was not a woman of business ; 
she turned them, no doubt, to indifferent account ; 
but she sold them piece by piece, and they kept 
her going while her daughter grew up. It was to 
this precarious traffic, conducted with extraor 
dinary mystery and delicacy, that, five years ago, 
in Florence, I was indebted for my acquaintance 
with her. In those days I used to collect 
heaven help me ! I used to pick up rubbish 
which I could ill afford. It was a little phase 
we have our little phases, have n t we ? " asked 
Gabriel Nash, with childlike trust "and I have 
come out on the other side. Mrs. Rooth had an 
old green pot, and I heard of her old green pot. 
To hear of it was to long for it, so that I went to 
see it, ander cover of night. I bought it, and a 
couple of years ago I overturned it and smashed 
it. It vvas the last of the little phase. It was 
not, however, as you have seen, the last of Mrs. 
Rooth. I saw her afterwards in London, and I 
met her a year or two ago, in Venice. She ap 
pears to be a great wanderer. She had other old 
pots, of other colors, red, yellow, black, or blue 
she could produce them of any complexion you 
liked. I don t know whether she carried them 
about with her or whether she had little secret 
stores in the principal cities of Europe. To-day, 
at any rate, they seem all gone. On the other 



68  

hand, she has her daughter, who has grown up 
and who is a precious vase of another kind less 
fragile, I hope, than the rest. May she not be 
overturned and smashed ! " 

Peter Sherringham and Biddy Dormer listened 
with attention to this history, and the girl tes 
tified to the interest with which she had followed 
it by saying, when Mr. Nash had ceased speak 
ing, " A Jewish stockbroker, a dealer in curiosi 
ties : what an odd person to marry for a per 
son who was well born ! I dare say he was a 
German." 

"His name must have been simply Roth, and 
the poor lady, to smarten it up, has put in an 
other &lt;?," Sherringham ingeniously suggested. 

" You are both very clever," said Gabriel Nash, 
" and Rudolf Roth, as I happen to know, was in 
deed the designation of Maud Vavasour s papa. 
But, as far as the question of derogation goes, one 
might as well drown as starve, for what connec 
tion is not a misalliance when one happens to have 
the cumbersome, the unaccommodating honor of 
being a Neville-Nugent of Castle Nugent ? Such 
was the high lineage of Maud s mamma. I seem 
to have heard it mentioned that Rudolf Roth was 
very versatile and, like most of his species, not 
unacquainted with the practice of music. He had 
been employed to teach the harmonium to Miss 
Neville-Nugent and she had profited by his les 
sons. If his daughter is like him and she is 
not like her mother he was darkly and danger- 



 69 

ously handsome. So I venture rapidly to recon 
struct the situation." 

A silence, for the moment, had fallen upon 
Lady Agnes and her other two children, so that 
Mr. Nash, with his universal urbanity, practically 
addressed these last remarks to them as well as 
to his other auditors. Lady Agnes looked as if 
she wondered whom he was talking about, and 
having caught the name of a noble residence she 
inquired 

" Castle Nugent where is that ? " 

" It s a domain of immeasurable extent and 
almost inconceivable splendor, but I fear it is n t 
to be found in any prosaic earthly geography ! " 
Lady Agnes rested her eyes on the tablecloth, 
as if she were not sure a liberty had not been 
taken with her, and while Mr. Nash continued to 
abound in descriptive suppositions " It must 
be on the banks of the Manzanares or the Guadal 
quivir Peter Sherringham, whose imagina 
tion appeared to have been strongly kindled by 
the sketch of Miriam Rooth, challenging him 
sociably, reminded him that he had, a short time 
before, assigned a low place to the dramatic art 
and had not yet answered his question as to 
whether he believed in the theatre. This gave 
Nash an opportunity to go on : 

" I don t know that I understand your ques 
tion ; there are different ways of taking it. Do 
I think it s important ? Is that what you mean ? 
Important, certainly, to managers and stage-car- 



70  

penters who want to make money, to ladies 
and gentlemen who want to produce themselves 
in public by lime-light, and to other ladies and 
gentlemen who are bored and stupid and don t 
know what to do with their evening. It s a com 
mercial and social convenience which may be in 
finitely worked. But important artistically, in 
tellectually ? How can it be so poor, so limited 
a form ? " 

" Dear me, it strikes me as so rich, so various ! 
Do you think it s poor and limited, Nick ? " 
Sherringham added, appealing to his kinsman. 

"I think whatever Nash thinks. I have no 
opinion to-day but his." 

This answer of Nick Dormer s drew the eyes 
of his mother and sisters to him and caused his 
friend to exclaim that he was not used to such 
responsibilities, so few people had ever tested his 
presence of mind by agreeing with him. 

"Oh, I used to be of your way of feeling," 
Nash said to Sherringham. " I understand you 
perfectly. It s a phase like another. I Ve been 
through itfai ete comme $a" 

" And you went, then, very often to the The 
atre Franc.ais, and it was there I saw you. I 
place you now." 

" I m afraid I noticed none of the other spec 
tators," Nash explained. " I had no attention 
but for the great Carre she was still on the 
stage. Judge of my infatuation, and how I can 
allow for yours, when I tell you that I sought her 



 Jl 

acquaintance, that I could n t rest till I had told 
her that I hung upon her lips." 

"That s just what /told her," returned Sher- 
ringham. 

" She was very kind to me. She said, Vous 
me rendez des forces. 
" That s just what she said to me ! " 
" And we have remained very good friends." 
" So have we! " laughed Sherringham. "And 
such perfect art as hers : do you mean to say 
you don t consider that important such a rare 
dramatic intelligence ? " 

" I m afraid you read the feuilletons. You 
catch their phrases," Gabriel Nash blandly re 
joined. "Dramatic intelligence is never rare; 
nothing is more common." 

" Then why have we so many bad actors ? " 
" Have we ? I thought they were mostly good ; 
succeeding more easily and more completely in 
that bt siness than in anything else. What could 
they dc those people, generally if they did n t 
do that ? And reflect that that enables them to 
succeed ! Of course, always, there are numbers 
of people on the stage who are no actors at all, 
for it s even easier to our poor humanity to be 
ineffectively stupid and vulgar than to bring down 
the house." 

&lt;% It s not easy, by what I can see, to produce, 
completely, any artistic effect," Sherringham de 
clared ; " and those that the actor produces are 
among the most moving that we know. You 11 



72  

not persuade me that to watch such an actress as 
Madame Carre was not an education of the taste, 
an enlargement of one s knowledge." 

" She did what she could, poor woman, but in 
what belittling, coarsening conditions ! She had 
to interpret a character in a play, and a character 
in a play (not to say the whole piece I speak 
more particularly of modern pieces) is such a 
wretchedly small peg to hang anything on ! The 
dramatist shows us so little, is so hampered by his 
audience, is restricted to so poor an analysis." 

" I know the complaint. It s all the fashion 
now. The raffints despise the theatre," said 
Peter Sherringham, in the manner of a man 
abreast with the culture of his age and not to be 
captured by a surprise. " Connu, connu ! " 

" It will be known better yet, won t it ? when 
the essentially brutal nature of the modern au 
dience is still more perceived, when it has been 
properly analyzed : the omnium gatherum of the 
population of a big commercial city, at the hour 
of the day when their taste is at its lowest, flock 
ing out of hideous hotels and restaurants, gorged 
with food, stultified with buying and selling and 
with all the other sordid preoccupations of the 
day, squeezed together in a sweltering mass, dis 
appointed in their seats, timing the author, timing 
the actor, wishing to get their money back on the 
spot, before eleven o clock. Fancy putting the 
exquisite before such a tribunal as that ! There s 
not even a question of it. The dramatist would n t 



 73 

if he could, and in nine cases out of ten he could n t 
if he would. He has to make the basest conces 
sions. One of his principal canons is that he must 
enable his spectators to catch the suburban trains, 
which stop at 11:30. What would you think of 
any other artist the painter or the novelist 
whose governing forces should be the dinner and 
the suburban trains ? The old dramatists did n t 
defer to them (not so much, at least), and that s 
why they are less and less actable. If they are 
touched the large fellows it s only to be 
mutilated and trivialized. Besides, they had a 
simpler civilization to represent societies in 
which the life of man was in action, in passion, 
in immediate and violent expression. Those 
things could be put upon the playhouse boards 
with comparatively little sacrifice of their com 
pleteness and their truth. To-day we are so in 
finitely more reflective and complicated and dif 
fuse that it makes all the difference. What can 
you do with a character, with an idea, with a 
feeling, between dinner and the suburban trains ? 
You can give a gross, rough sketch of them, but 
how little you touch them, how bald you leave 
them ! What crudity compared with what the 
novelist does ! " 

" Do you write novels, Mr. Nash ? " Peter de 
manded. 

" No, but I read them when they are extraor 
dinarily good, and I don t go to plays. I read 
Balzac, for instance I encounter the magnifi- 



74  

cent portrait of Valerie Marneffe, in La Cou- 
sine Bette. " 

"And you contrast it with the poverty of 
Emile Augier s Seraphine in ( Les Lionnes 
Pauvres ? I was awaiting you there. That s 
the cheval de bataille of you fellows." 

" What an extraordinary discussion ! What 
dreadful authors ! " Lady Agnes murmured to 
her son. But he was listening so attentively to 
the other young men that he made no response, 
and Peter Sherringham went on : 

"I have seen Madame Carre in parts, in the 
modern repertory, which she has made as vivid to 
me, caused to abide as ineffaceably in my mem 
ory, as Valerie Marneffe. She is the Balzac, as 
one may say, of actresses." 

"The miniaturist, as it were, of whitewash- 
ers ! " Nash rejoined, laughing. 

It might have been guessed that Sherringham 
was irritated, but the other disputant was so 
good-humored that he abundantly recognized his 
own obligation to appear so. 

" You would be magnanimous if you thought 
the young lady you have introduced to our old 
friend would be important." 

" She might be much more so than she ever 
will be." 

Lady Agnes got up, to terminate the scene, 
and even to signify that enough had been said 
about people and questions she had never heard 
of. Every one else rose, the waiter brought 



 75 

Nicholas the receipt of the bill, and Sherringham 
went on, to his interlocutor 

" Perhaps she will be more so than you think." 

" Perhaps if you take an interest in her ! " 

" A mystic voice seems to exhort me to do so, 
to whisper that, though I have never seen her, I 
shall find something in her. What do you say, 
Biddy, shall I take an interest in her ? " 

Biddy hesitated a moment, colored a little, felt 
a certain embarrassment in being publicly treated 
as an oracle. 

" If she s not nice I don t advise it." 

"And if she is nice? " 

"You advise it still less!" her brother ex- 
claimed, laughing and putting his arm round 
her. 

Lady Agnes looked sombre she might have 
been saying to herself, " Dear me, what chance 
has a girl of mine with a man who s so agog 
about actresses ? " She was disconcerted and 
distressed ; a multitude of incongruous things, all 
the morning, had been forced upon her attention 
displeasing pictures and still more displeasing 
theories about them, vague portents of perversity 
on the part of Nicholas, and a strange eagerness 
on Peter s, learned apparently in Paris, to discuss, 
with a person who had atone she never had been 
exposed to, topics irrelevant and uninteresting, 
the practical effect of which was to make light of 
her presence. " Let us leave this let us leave 
this ! " she almost moaned. The party moved 



76  

together toward the door of departure, and her 
ruffled spirit was not soothed by hearing her son 
remark to his terrible friend, " You know you 
don t leave us I stick to you ! " 

At this Lady Agnes broke out and interposed, 
"Excuse me for reminding you that you are 
going to call on Julia." 

" Well, can t Nash also come to call on Julia ? 
That s just what I want that she should see 
him." 

Peter Sherringham came humanely to her 
ladyship s assistance. "A better way, perhaps, 
will be for them to meet under my auspices, at 
my dramatic tea. This will enable me to re 
turn one favor for another. If Mr. Nash is so 
good as to introduce me to this aspirant for hon 
ors we estimate so differently, I will introduce 
him to my sister, a much more positive quan 
tity." 

" It is easy to see who 11 have the best of it ! " 
Grace Dormer exclaimed ; and Gabriel Nash 
stood there serenely, impartially, in a graceful, de 
tached" way which seemed characteristic of him, 
assenting to any decision that relieved him of 
the grossness of choice and generally confident 
that things would turn out well for him. He 
was cheerfully helpless and sociably indifferent ; 
ready to preside, with a smile, even at a discus 
sion of his own admissibility. 

" Nick will bring you. I have a little corner 
at the Embassy," Sherringham continued. 



 77 

"You are very kind. You must bring him, 
then, to-morrow Rue de Constantinople." 
"At five o clock don t be afraid." 
" Oh, dear ! " said Biddy, as they went on 
again ; and Lady Agnes, seizing his arm, marched 
off more quickly with her son. When they came 
out into the Champs Elysees Nick Dormer, look 
ing round, saw that his friend had disappeared. 
Biddy had attached herself to Peter, and Grace, 
apparently, had not encouraged Mr. Nash. 



V. 

LADY AGNES S idea had been that her son 
shouM go straight from the Palais cle 1 Industrie 
to the Hotel de Hollande, with or without his 
mother and his sisters, as his humor should seem 
to recommend. Much as she desired to see their 
brilliant kinswoman, and as she knew that her 
daughters desired it, she was quite ready to post 
pone their visit, if this sacrifice should contribute 
to a speedy confrontation for Nick. She was 
eager that he should talk with Mrs. Dallow, and 
eager that he should be eager himself ; but it 
presently appeared that he was really not any 
thing that could impartially be called so. His 
view was that she and the girls should go to the 
Hotel de Hollande without delay, and should 
spend the rest of the day with Julia, if they liked. 
He would go later ; he would go in the evening. 
There were lots of things he wanted to do mean 
while. 

This question was discussed with some inten 
sity, though not at length, while the little party 
stood on the edge of the Place de la Concorde, 
to which they had proceeded on foot ; and Lady 
Agnes noticed that the "lots of things " to which 
he proposed to give precedence over an urgent 



 79 

duty, a conference with a person who held out 
full hands to him, were implied somehow in the 
friendly glance with which he covered the great 
square, the opposite bank of the Seine, the steep 
blue roofs of the quay, the bright immensity of 
Paris. What in the world could be more impor 
tant than making sure of his seat ? so quickly 
did the good lady s imagination travel. And now 
that idea appealed to him less than a ramble in 
search of old books and prints, for she was sure 
this was what he had in his head. Julia would 
be flattered if she knew it, but of course she 
must not know it. Lady Agnes was already 
thinking of the most honorable explanations she 
could give of the young man s want of precipita 
tion. She would have liked to represent him as 
tremendously occupied, in his room at their own 
hotel, in getting off political letters to every one 
it shou d concern, and particularly in drawing up 
his adcress to the electors of Harsh. Fortu 
nately she was a woman of innumerable discre 
tions, and a part of the worn look that sat in her 
face carne from her having schooled herself for 
years, in her relations with her husband and her 
sons, not to insist unduly. She would have liked 
to insist, nature had formed her to insist, and the 
self-control had told in more ways than one. 
Even now it was powerless to prevent her sug 
gesting that before doing anything else Nick 
should at least repair to the inn and see if there 
were not some telegrams. 



80  

He freely consented to do so much as this, and 
having called a cab, that she might go her way 
with the girls, he kissed her again, as he had 
done at the exhibition. This was an attention 
that could never displease her, but somehow when 
he kissed her often her anxiety was apt to in 
crease : she had come to recognize it as a sign 
that he was slipping away from her. She drove 
off with a vague sense that at any rate she and 
the girls might do something toward keeping the 
place warm for him. She had been a little vexed 
that Peter had not administered more of a push 
toward the Hotel de Hollande, clear as it had be 
come to her now that there was a foreignness in 
Peter which was not to be counted on, and which 
made him speak of English affairs and even of 
English domestic politics as local. Of course 
they were local, and was not that the warm hu 
man comfort of them ? As she left the two 
young men standing together in the middle of 
the Place de la Concorde, the grand composition 
of which Nick, as she looked back, appeared to 
have paused to admire (as if he had not seen it 
a thousand times !), she wished she might have 
thought of Peter s influence with her son as ex 
erted a little more in favor of localism. She had 
a sense that he would not abbreviate the boy s ill- 
timed fldnerie. However, he had been very nice : 
he had invited them all to dine with him that 
evening at a convenient restaurant, promising to 
bring Julia and one of his colleagues. So much 



7 ffE TKAGIC MUSE. 8 1 

as this he had been willing to do to make sure 
that Nick and his sister should meet. His want 
of localism, moreover, was not so great as that if 
it should turn out that there was anything be 
neath his manner toward Biddy ! The conclu 
sion of this reflection is, perhaps, best indicated 
by the circumstance of her ladyship s remarking, 
after a minute, to her younger daughter, who sat 
opposite to her in the voiture de place, that it would 
do no harm if she should get a new hat, and that 
the article might be purchased that afternoon. 

" A French hat, mamma ? " said Grace. " Oh, 
do wait till she gets home ! " 

"I think they are prettier here, you know," 
Biddy rejoined ; and Lady Agnes said, simply, 
" I dare say they re cheaper." What was in-her 
mind, in fact, was, " I dare say Peter thinks them 
becoming." It will be seen that she had plenty 
of spiritual occupation, the sum of which was 
not diminished by her learning, when she reached 
the top of the Rue de la Paix, that Mrs. Dallow 
had gone out half an hour before and had left no 
message. She was more disconcerted by this in 
cident than she could have explained or than she 
thought was right, for she had taken for granted 
that Julia would be in a manner waiting for them. 
How did she know that Nick was not coming ? 
When people were in Paris for a few days they 
did n t mope in the house; but Julia might have 
waited a little longer or might have left an expla 
nation. Was she then not so much in earnest 



82  

about Nick s standing ? Did n t she recognize 
the importance of being there to see him about 
it ? Lady Agnes wondered whether Julia s be 
havior were a sign that she was already tired of 
the way this young gentleman treated her. Per 
haps she had gone out because an instinct told 
her that its being important he should see her 
early would make no difference with him told 
her that he would n t come. Her heart sank as 
she glanced at this possibility that Julia was al 
ready tired, for she, on her side, had an instinct 
there were still more tiresome things in store. 
She had disliked having to tell Mrs. Dallow that 
Nick would n t see her till the evening, but now 
she disliked still more her not being there to 
hear it. She even resented a little her kinswo 
man s not having reasoned that she and the girls 
would come in any event, and not thought them 
worth staying in for. It occurred to her that she 
would, perhaps, have gone to their hotel, which 
was a good way up the Rue de Rivoli, near the 
Palais Royal, and she directed the cabman to 
drive to that establishment. 

As he jogged along, she took in some degree 
the measure of what that might mean, Julia s 
seeking a little to avoid them. Was she growing 
to dislike them ? Did she think they kept too 
sharp an eye on her, so that the idea of their 
standing in a still closer relation to her would not 
be enticing? Her conduct up to this time had 
not worn such an appearance, unless, perhaps, 



 83 

a little, just a very little, in the matter of poor 
Grace. Lady Agnes knew that she was not par 
ticularly fond of poor Grace, and was even able 
to guess the reason the manner in which Grace 
betrayed the most that they wanted to make sure 
of her. She remembered how long the girl had 
stayed the last time she had gone to Harsh. She 
had gone for an acceptable week, and she had 
been in the house a month. She took a private, 
heroic vow that Grace should not go near the 
place again for a year ; that is, not unless Nick 
and Julia were married before this. If that were 
to happen, she should n t care. She recognized 
that it was not absolutely everything that Julia 
should be in love with Nick ; it was also better 
she should dislike his mother and sisters after 
than before. Lady Agnes did justice to the nat 
ural rule in virtue of which it usually comes to 
pass that a woman does n t get on with her hus- 
band $ female belongings, and was even willing 
to be sacrificed to it in her disciplined degree. 
But she desired not to be sacrificed for nothing : 
if she was to be objected to as a mother-in-law, 
she wished to be the mother-in-law first. 

At the hotel in the Rue de Rivoli she had the 
disappointment of finding that Mrs. Dallow had 
not called, and also that no telegrams had come. 
She went in with the girls for half an hour, and 
then she straggled out with them again. She was 
undetermined and dissatisfied, and the afternoon 
was rather a problem ; of the kind, moreover, 



84  

that she disliked most and was least accustomed 
to : not a choice between different things to do 
(her life had been full of that), but a want of any 
thing to do at all. Nick had said to her before 
they separated, " You can knock about with the 
girls, you know ; everything is amusing here." 
That was easily said, while he sauntered and gos 
siped with Peter Sherringham and perhaps went 
to see more pictures like those in the Salon. He 
was usually, on such occasions, very good-natured 
about spending his time with them ; but this epi 
sode had taken altogether a perverse, profane 
form. She had no desire whatever to knock 
about, and she was far from finding everything in 
Paris amusing. She had no aptitude for aimless- 
ness, and, moreover, she thought it vulgar. If 
she had found Julia s card at the hotel (the sign 
of a hope of catching them just as they came 
back from the Salon), she would have made a 
second attempt to see her before the evening ; 
but now certainly they would leave her alone. 
Lady Agnes wandered joylessly with the girls in 
the Palais Royal and the Rue de Richelieu, and 
emerged upon the Boulevard, where they contin 
ued their frugal prowl, as Biddy rather irritatingly 
called it. They went into five shops to buy a 
hat for Biddy, and her ladyship s presuppositions 
of cheapness were wofully belied. 

" Who in the world is your funny friend ? " 
Peter Sherringham asked of his kinsman, without 
loss of time, as they walked together.

"Ah, there s something else you lost by going 
to Cambridge you lost Gabriel Nash ! " 

" He sounds like an Elizabethan dramatist," 
Sherringham said. " But I have n t lost him, 
since it appears now that I shall not be able to 
have you without him." 

" Oh, as for that, wait a little. I m going to 
try him again, but I don t know how he wears. 
What I mean is that you have probably lost his 
freshness. I have an idea he has become con 
ventional, or at any rate serious." 

" Bless me, do you call that serious ? " 

" He used to be so gay. He had a real genius 
for suggestive paradox. He was a wonderful 
talker." 

" It seems to me he does very well now," said 
Peter Sherringham. 

" Oh, this is nothing. He had great flights of 
old, ver/ great flights ; one saw him rise and rise, 
and turn somersaults in the blue, and wondered 
how far he could go. He s very intelligent, and 
I should think it might be interesting to find out 
what it is that prevents the whole man from being 
as good as his parts. I mean in case he is n t so 
good." 

" I see you more than suspect that. May it 
not simply be that he s an ass ? " 

" That would be the whole I shall see in time 
but it certainly is n t one of the parts. It may 
be the effect, but it is n t the cause, and it s for 
the cause that I claim an interest. I imagine you 



86  

think he s an ass on account of what he said about 
the theatre, his pronouncing it a coarse art." 

"To differ about him that reason will do," said 
Sherringham. The only bad one would be one 
that shouldn t preserve our difference. You 
need n t tell me you agree with him, for, frankly 
I don t care." 

" Then your passion still burns ? " Nick Dor 
mer asked. 

" My passion ? " 

" I don t mean for any individual exponent of 
the contestable art: mark the guilty conscience, 
mark the rising blush, mark the confusion of 
mind ! I mean the old sign one knew you best 
by: your permanent stall at the Francis/your 
inveterate attendance at premises, the way you 
follow the young talents and the old." 

" Yes, it s still my little hobby ; my little folly, 
f you like. I don t see that I get tired of it 
What will you have ? Strong predilections are 
rather a blessing ; they are simplifying. I am 
fond of representation the representation of 
I like it better, I think, than the real thing. 
You like it, too, so you have no right to cast the 
You like it best clone one way and I 
another; and our preference, on either side has 
a deep root in us. There is a fascination to me 
m the way the actor does it, when his talent (ah, 
he must have that !) has been highly trained (ah 
it must be that !). The things he can do, in this 
effort at representation (with the dramatist to 



 87 

give him his lift) seem to me innumerable he 
can carry it to a delicacy ! and I take great 
pleasure in observing them, in recognizing them 
and comparing them. It s an amusement like 
another : I don t pretend to call it by any exalted 
name ; but in this vale of friction it will serve. 
One can lose one s self in it, and it has this recom 
mendation (in common, I suppose, with the study 
of the other arts), that the further you go in it 
the more you find. So I go rather far, if you will. 
But is it the principal sign one knows me by ? " 
Sherringham abruptly asked. 

" Don t be ashamed of it, or it will be ashamed 
of you. I ought to discriminate. You are dis 
tinguished among my friends and relations by 
being a rising young diplomatist ; but you know 
I always want the further distinction, the last 
analysis. Therefore I surmise that you are 
conspicuous among rising young diplomatists for 
the infa .uation that you describe in such pretty 
terms." 

" You evidently believe that it will prevent me 
from rising very high. But pastime for pastime, 
is it any idler than yours ? " 

" Than mine ? " 

" Why, you have half a dozen, while I only al 
low myself the luxury of one. For the theatre is 
my sole vice, really. Is this more wanton, say, 
than to devote weeks to ascertaining in what par 
ticular way your friend Mr. Nash may be a twad 
dler ? That s not my ideal of choice recreation, 



THE TKAGIC MUSE. 

but I would undertake to do it sooner. You re 
a young statesman (who happens to be en dis- 
ponibiiite for the moment), but you spend not a 
little of your time in besmearing canvas with 
bright-colored pigments. The idea of represen 
tation fascinates you, but in your case it s rep 
resentation in oils or do you practice water- 
colors, too ? You even go much further than I, 
for I study my art of predilection only in the 
works of others. I don t aspire to leave works 
of my own. You re a painter, possibly a great 
one; but I m not an actor." Nick Dormer de 
clared that he would certainly become one he 
was on the way to it ; and Sherringham, without 
heeding this charge, went on : " Let me add that, 
considering you are a painter, your portrait of the 
complicated Nash is lamentably dim." 

" He s not at all complicated ; he s only too 
simple to give an account of. Most people have 
a lot of attributes and appendages that dress 
them up and superscribe them, and what I like 
him for is that he hasn t any at all. It makes 
him so cool." 

"By Jove, you match him there ! It s an at 
tribute to be tolerated. How does he manage 
it ?" 

" I haven t the least idea I don t know that 
he is tolerated. I don t think any one has ever 
detected the process. His means, his profession, 
his belongings, have never anything to do with 
the question. He does n t shade off into other 



 89 

people ; he s as neat as an outline cut out of 
paper with scissors. I like him, therefore, be 
cause in intercourse with him you know what 
you ve got hold of. With most men you don t : 
to pick the flower you must break off the whole 
dusty, thorny, worldly branch ; you find you are 
taking up in your grasp all sorts of other people 
and things, dangling accidents and conditions. 
Poor Nash has none of those ramifications : he s 
the solitary blossom." 

" My dear fellow, you would be better for a 
little of the same pruning!" Sherringham ex 
claimed ; and the young men continued their 
walk and their gossip, jerking each other this 
way and that with a sociable roughness conse 
quent on their having been boys together. Inti 
macy had reigned, of old, between the little 
Sherringhams and the little Dormers, united by 
country contiguity and by the circumstance that 
there was first cousinship, not neglected, among 
the parents, Lady Agnes standing in this convert 
ible relation to Lady Windrush, the mother of 
Peter and Julia, as well as of other daughters and 
of a maturer youth who was to inherit, and who 
since then had inherited, the ancient barony. 
Since then many things had altered, but not the 
deep foundation of sociability. One of our young 
men had gone to Eton and the other to Harrow 
(the scattered school on the hill was the tradition 
of the Dormers), and the divergence had taken 
its course later, in university years. Bricket, 



90  

however, had remained accessible to Windrush, 
and Windrush to Bricket, to which Percival Dor 
mer had now succeeded, terminating the inter 
change a trifle rudely by letting out that pleasant 
white house in the midlands (its expropriated in 
habitants, Lady Agnes and her daughters, adored 
it) to an American reputed rich, who, in the first 
flush of international comparison, considered that 
for twelve hundred a year he got it at a bargain. 
Bricket had come to the late Sir Nicholas from 
his elder brother, who died wifeless and childless. 
The new baronet, so different from his father 
(though he recalled at some points the uncle after 
whom he had been named) that Nick had to 
make it up by aspirations of resemblance, roamed 
about the world, taking shots which excited the 
enthusiasm of society, when society heard of 
them, at the few legitimate creatures of the chase 
which the British rifle had spared. Lady Agnes, 
meanwhile, settled with her girls in a gabled, lat 
ticed house in a creditable quarter, though it was 
still a little raw, of the temperate zone of London. 
It was not into her lap, poor woman, that the 
revenues of Bricket were poured. There was no 
dower-house attached to that moderate property, 
and the allowance with which the estate was 
charged on her ladyship s behalf was not an in 
citement to grandeur. 

Nick had a room under his mother s roof, which 
he mainly used to dress for dinner when he dined 
in Calcutta Gardens, and he had " kept on " his 



I 



 Ql 

chambers in the Temple ; for to a young man in 
public life an independent address was indispen 
sable. Moreover, he was suspected of having a 
studio in an out-of-the-way quarter of the town, 
the indistinguishable parts of South Kensington, 
incongruous as such a retreat might seem in the 
case of a member of Parliament. It was an ab 
surd place to see his constituents, unless he wanted 
to paint their portraits, a kind of representation 
with which they scarcely would have been satis 
fied ; and in fact the only question of portraiture 
had been when the wives and daughters of sev 
eral of them expressed a wish for the picture of 
their handsome young member. Nick had not 
offered to paint it himself, and the studio was 
taken for granted rather than much looked into 
by the ladies in Calcutta Gardens. Too express 
a disposition to regard whims of this sort as a 
pure extravagance was known by them to be 
open to correction ; for they were not oblivious 
that Mr Carteret had humors which weighed 
against tnem, in the shape of convenient cheques 
nestling between the inside pages of legible let 
ters of advice. Mr. Carteret was Nick s provi 
dence, as Nick was looked to, in a general way, 
to be that of his mother and sisters, especially 
since it had become so plain that Percy, who was 
ungracefully selfish, would operate, mainly with 
a "six-bore," quite out of that sphere. It was 
not for studios, certainly, that Mr. Carteret sent 
cheques ; but they were an expression of general 



92  

confidence in Nick, and a little expansion was 
natural to a young man enjoying such a luxury 
as that. It was sufficiently felt, in Calcutta Gar 
dens, that Nick could be looked to not to betray 
such a confidence ; for Mr. Carteret s behavior 
could have no name at all unless one were pre 
pared to call it encouraging. He had never 
promised anything, but he was one of the de 
lightful persons with whom the redemption pre 
cedes or dispenses with the vow. He had been 
an early and lifelong friend of the late right 
honorable gentleman, a political follower, a de 
voted admirer, a stanch supporter in difficult 
hours. He had never married, espousing nothing 
more reproductive than Sir Nicholas s views (he 
used to write letters to the Times in favor of 
them), and had, so far as was known, neither 
chick nor child ; nothing but an amiable little 
family of eccentricities, the flower of which was 
his odd taste for living in a small, steep, clean, 
country town, all green gardens and red walls, 
with a girdle of hedgerows, clustering about an 
immense brown old abbey. When Lady Agnes s 
imagination rested upon the future of her second 
son, she liked to remember that Mr. Carteret had 
nothing to " keep up : " the inference seemed so 
direct that he would keep up Nick. 

The most important event in the life of this 
young man had been incomparably his victory, 
under his father s eyes, more than two years 
before, in the sharp contest for Crockhurst a 



 93 

victory which his consecrated name, his extreme 
youth, his ardor in the fray, the general personal 
sympathy of the party and the attention excited 
by the fresh cleverness of his speeches, tinted 
with young idealism and yet sticking sufficiently 
to the question (the burning question, it has 
since burned out), had rendered almost brilliant. 
There had been leaders in the newspapers about 
it, half in compliment to her husband, who was 
known to be failing so prematurely (he was al 
most as young to die, and to die famous 
Lady Agnes regarded it as famous as his son 
had been to stand), which the boy s mother re 
ligiously preserved, cut out and tied together 
with a ribbon, in the innermost drawer of a fa 
vorite cabinet. But it had been a barren, or 
almost a barren triumph, for in the order of im 
portance in Nick s history another incident had 
run it, as the phrase is, very close : nothing less 
than the quick dissolution of the Parliament in 
which he was so manifestly destined to give 
symptoms of a future. He had not recovered 
his seat at the general election, for the second 
contest was even sharper than the first, and the 
Tories had put forward a loud, vulgar, rattling, 
almost bullying man. It was to a certain extent 
a comfort that poor Sir Nicholas, who had been 
witness of the bright hour, passed away before 
the darkness. He died, with all his hopes on his 
second son s head, unconscious of near disaster, 
handing on the torch and the tradition, after 



94  

a long, supreme interview with Nick, at which 
Lady Agnes had not been present, but which she 
knew to have been a sort of paternal dedication, 
a solemn communication of ideas on the highest 
national questions (she had reason to believe he 
had touched on those of external as well as of 
domestic and of colonial policy), leaving on the 
boy s nature and manner from that moment the 
most unmistakable traces. If his tendency to rev 
erie increased, it was because he had so much to 
think over in what his pale father had said to him 
in the hushed, dim chamber, laying upon him the 
great mission of carrying out the unachieved and 
reviving a silent voice. It was work cut out for a 
lifetime, and that " coordinating power in relation 
to detail," which was one of the great characteris 
tics of Sir Nicholas s high distinction (the most 
analytic of the weekly papers was always talking 
about it), had enabled him to rescue the prospect 
from any shade of vagueness or of ambiguity. 

Five years before Nick Dormer went up to be 
questioned by the electors of Crockhurst, Peter 
Sherringham appeared before a board of exami 
ners who let him off much less easily, though there 
were also some flattering prejudices in his favor ; 
such influences being a part of the copious, light, 
unembarrassing baggage with which each of the 
young men began life. Peter passed, however, 
passed high, and had his reward in prompt assign 
ment to small subordinate diplomatic duties in 
Germany. Since then he had had his profes- 



 95 

sional adventures, which need not arrest us, 
inasmuch as they had all paled in the light of his 
appointment, nearly three years previous to the 
moment of our making his acquaintance, to a 
secretaryship of embassy in Paris. He had done 
well and had gone fast, and for the present he 
was willing enough to rest. It pleased him bet 
ter to remain in Paris as a subordinate than to 
go to Honduras as a principal, and Nick Dormer 
had not put a false colour on the matter in speak 
ing of his stall at the Theatre Frangais as a 
sedative to his ambition. Nick s inferiority in age 
to his cousin sat on him more lightly than when 
they had been in their teens ; and indeed no one 
can very well be much older than a young man 
who has figured for a year, however impercepti 
bly, in the House of Commons. Separation and 
diversity had made them strange enough to each 
other o give a taste to what they shared ; they 
were friends without being particular friends ; 
that further degree could always hang before 
them as a suitable but not oppressive contin 
gency, and they were both conscious that it was 
in their interest to keep certain differences to 
"chaff" each other about so possible was it 
that they might have quarreled if they had only 
agreed. Peter, as being wide-minded, was a little 
irritated to find his cousin always so intensely 
British, while Nick Dormer made him the object 
of the same compassionate criticism, recognized 
that he had a rare knack with foreign tongues, 



g6  

but reflected, and even with extravagance de 
clared, that it was a pity to have gone so far from 
home only to remain so homely. Moreover, 
Nick had his ideas about the diplomatic mind ; it 
was the moral type of which, on the whole, he 
thought least favorably. Dry, narrow, barren, 
poor, he pronounced it in familiar conversation 
with the clever secretary ; wanting in imagina 
tion, in generosity, in the finest perceptions and 
the highest courage. This served as well as any 
thing else to keep the peace between them ; it 
was a necessity of their friendly intercourse that 
they should scuffle a little, and it scarcely mat 
tered what they scuffled about. Nick Dormer s 
express enjoyment of Paris, the shop-windows on 
the quays, the old books on the parapet, the 
gayety of the river, the grandeur of the Louvre, 
all the amusing tints and tones, struck his com 
panion as a sign of insularity ; the appreciation 
of such things having become with Sherringham 
an unconscious habit, a contented assimilation. 
If poor Nick, for the hour, was demonstrative 
and lyrical, it was because he had no other way 
of sounding the note of farewell to the indepen 
dent life of which the term seemed now definitely 
in sight ; the sense pressed upon him that these 
were the last moments of his freedom. He would 
waste time till half past seven, because half past 
seven meant dinner, and dinner meant his mother, 
solemnly attended by the strenuous shade of his 
father and reinforced by Julia. 



VI. 

WHEN Nick arrived with the three members of 
his family, Peter Sherringham was seated in the 
restaurant at which the tryst had been taken at a 
small but immaculate table ; but Mrs. Dallow was 
not yet on the scene, and they had time for a so 
ciable settlement time to take their places and 
unfold their napkins, crunch their rolls, breathe 
the savory air and watch the door, before the 
usual raising of heads and suspension of forks, 
the sort of stir that accompanied most of this 
lady s movements, announced her entrance. The 
dame de comptoir ducked and re-ducked, the peo 
ple looked round, Peter and Nick got up, there 
was shuffling of chairs and Julia was there. 
Peter had related how he had stopped at her 
hotel to bring her with him and had found her, 
according to her custom, by no means ready ; on 
which, fearing that his guests would come first to 
the rendezvous and find no proper welcome, he 
had come off without her, leaving her to follow. 
He had not brought a friend, as he intended, hav 
ing divined that Julia would prefer a pure family 
party, if she wanted to talk about her candi 
date. Now she stood there, looking down at the 
table and her expectant kinsfolk, drawing off her 



98  

gloves, letting her brother draw off her jacket, 
lifting her hands for some rearrangement of her 
bonnet. She looked at Nick last, smiling, but 
only for a moment. She said to Peter, " Are we 
going to dine here ? Oh dear, why did n t you 
have a private room ? " 

Nick had not seen her at all for several weeks, 
and had seen her but little for a year, but her off 
hand, cursory manner had not altered in the in 
terval. She spoke remarkably fast, as if speech 
were not in itself a pleasure to have it over as 
soon as possible ; and her brusquerie was of the 
kind that friendly critics account for by pleading 
shyness. Shyness had never appeared to him an 
ultimate quality or a real explanation of anything ; 
it only explained an effect by another effect, giv 
ing a bad fault another name. What he sus 
pected in Julia was that her mind was less grace 
ful than her person ; an ugly, a really damnatory 
idea, which as yet he had only half accepted. It 
was a case in which she was entitled to the ben 
efit of every doubt and ought not to be judged 
without a complete trial. Dormer, meanwhile, 
was afraid of the trial (this was partly why, of 
late, he had been to see her so little), because he 
was afraid of the sentence, afraid of anything 
happening which should lessen the pleasure it 
was actually in the power of her beauty to give. 
There were people who thought her rude, and he 
hated rude women. If he should fasten on that 
view, or rather if that view should fasten on him, 



 99 

what could still please and what he admired in 
her would lose too much of its sweetness. If it 
be thought odd that he had not yet been able to 
read the character of a woman he had known 
since childhood, the answer is that that character 
had grown faster than Nick Dormer s observa 
tion. The growth was constant, whereas the ob 
servation was but occasional, though it had begun 
early. If he had attempted to phrase the matter 
to himself, as he probably had not, he might have 
said that the effect she produced upon him was 
too much a compulsion ; not the coercion of de 
sign, of importunity, nor the vulgar pressure of 
family expectation, a suspected desire that he 
should like her enough to marry her, but some 
thing that was a mixture of diverse things, of the 
sense that she was imperious and generous 
but probably more the former than the latter 
and of a certain prevision of doom, the influence 
of the idea that he should come to it, that he was 
predestined. 

This had made him shrink from knowing the 
worst about her ; the desire, not to get used to it 
in time, but what was more characteristic of him, 
to interpose a temporary illusion. Illusions and 
realities and hopes and fears, however, fell into 
confusion whenever he met her after a separation. 
The separation, so far as seeing her alone or as 
continuous talk was concerned, had now been tol 
erably long ; had lasted really ever since his fail 
ure to regain his seat. An impression had come 



100  

to him that she judged that failure rather harshly, 
had thought he ought to have done better. This 
was a part of her imperious strain, and a part to 
which it was not easy to accommodate one s self 
on a present basis. If he were to marry her he 
should come to an understanding with her : he 
should give her his own measure as well as take 
hers. But the understanding, in the actual case, 
might suggest too much that he was to marry 
her. You could quarrel with your wife, because 
there were compensations for her ; but you 
might not be prepared to offer these compensa 
tions as prepayment for the luxury of quarreling. 
It was not that such a luxury would not be 
considerable, Nick Dormer thought, as Julia Dai- 
low s fine head poised itself before him again ; a 
high spirit was a better thing than a poor one to 
be mismated with, any day in the year. She had 
much the same coloring as her brother, but as 
nothing else in her face was the same, the re 
semblance was not striking. Her hair was of so 
dark a brown that it was commonly regarded as 
black, and so abundant that a plain arrangement 
was required to keep it in discreet relation to the 
rest of her person. Her eyes were of a gray tint 
that was sometimes pronounced too light ; and 
they were not sunken in her face, but placed well 
on the surface. Her nose was perfect, but her 
mouth was too small ; and Nick Dormer, and 
doubtless other persons as well, had sometimes 
wondered how, with such a mouth, her face could 



 IOI 

have expressed decision. Her figure helped it, 
for she looked tall (being extremely slender), 
though she was not ; and her head took turns 
and positions which, though they were a matter 
of but half an inch out of the common, this way 
or that, somehow contributed to the air of reso 
lution and temper. If it had not been for her 
extreme delicacy of line and surface, she might 
have been called bold ; but as it was she looked 
refined and quiet refined by tradition, and quiet 
for a purpose. And altogether she was beautiful, 
with the pure style of her capable head, her hair 
like darkness, her eyes like early twilight, her 
mouth like a rare pink flower. 

Peter said that he had not taken a private 
room because he knew Biddy s tastes ; she liked 
to see the world (she had told him so), the curious 
people, the coming and going of Paris. " Oh, 
anything for Biddy ! " Julia replied, smiling at 
the gill and taking her place. Lady Agnes and 
her elder daughter exchanged one of their looks, 
and Nick exclaimed jocosely that he did n t see 
why the whole party should be sacrificed to a 
presumptuous child. The presumptuous child 
blushingly protested she had never expressed 
any such wish to Peter, upon which Nick, with 
broader humor, revealed that Peter had served 
them so out of stinginess : he had pitchforked 
them together in the public room because he 
would n t go to the expense of a cabinet. He had 
brought no guest, no foreigner of distinction nor 



102  

diplomatic swell, to honor them, and now they 
would see what a paltry dinner he would give 
them. Peter stabbed him indignantly with a 
long roll, and Lady Agnes, who seemed to be 
waiting for some manifestation on Mrs. Dallow s 
part which did n t come, concluded, with a cer 
tain coldness, that they quite sufficed to them 
selves for privacy as well as for society. Nick 
called attention to this fine phrase of his mother s, 
said it was awfully neat, while Grace and Biddy 
looked harmoniously at Julia s clothes. Nick felt 
nervous, and joked a good deal to carry it off 
a levity that did n t prevent Julia s saying to him, 
after a moment, " You might have come to see 
me to-day, you know. Did n t you get my mes 
sage from Peter? " 

" Scold him, Julia scold him well. I begged 
him to go," said Lady Agnes ; and to this Grace 
added her voice with an " Oh, Julia, do give it 
to him ! " These words, however, had not the 
effect they suggested, for Mrs. Dallow only mur 
mured, with an ejaculation, in her quick, curt 
way, that that would be making far too much of 
him. It was one of the things in her which Nick 
Dormer mentally pronounced ungraceful, that a 
perversity of pride or shyness always made her 
disappoint you a little, if she saw you expected a 
thing. She was certain to snub effusiveness. 
This vice, however, was the last thing of which 
Lady Agnes would have consented to being ac 
cused ; and Nick, while he replied to Julia that 



 1 03 

he was certain he should n t have found her, was 
not unable to perceive the operation, on his 
mother, of that shade of manner. " He ought to 
have gone ; he owed you that," she went on ; 
" but it s very true he would have had the same 
luck as we. I went with the girls directly after 
luncheon. I suppose you got our card." 

" He might have come after I came in," said 
Mrs. Dallow. 

" Dear Julia, I m going to see you to-night. 
I ve been waiting for that," Nick rejoined. 

" Of course we had no idea when you would 
come in," said Lady Agnes. 

" I m so sorry. You must come to-morrow. 
I hate calls at night," Julia remarked. 

" Well, then, will you roam with me ? Will 
you wander through Paris on my arm ? " Nick 
asked, smiling. "Will you take a drive with 
me ? " 

" Oh, that would be perfection ! " cried Grace. 

" I thought we were all going somewhere to 
the Hippodrome, Peter," said Biddy. 

" Oh, not all ; just you and me ! " laughed 
Peter. 

" I am going home to my bed. I ve earned 
my rest," Lady Agnes sighed. 

" Can t Peter take us ? " asked Grace. " Nick 
can take you home, mamma, if Julia won t receive 
him, and I can look perfectly after Peter and 
Biddy." 

"Take them to something amusing; please 



104  

take them," Mrs. Dallow said to her brother. 
Her voice was kind, but had the expectation of 
assent in it, and Nick observed both the indul 
gence and the pressure. " You re tired, poor 
dear," she continued to Lady Agnes. "Fancy 
your being dragged about so ! What did you 
come over for ? " 

" My mother came because I brought her," 
Nick said. " It s I who have dragged her about. 
I brought her for a little change. I thought 
it would do her good. I wanted to see the 
Salon." 

" It is n t a bad time. I have a carriage, and 
you must use it ; you must use nothing else. It 
shall take you everywhere. I will drive you 
about to-morrow." Julia dropped these words in 
the same perfunctory casual way as any others ; 
but Nick had already noted, and he noted now 
afresh, with pleasure, that her abruptness was 
perfectly capable of conveying a benevolence. It 
was quite sufficiently manifest to him that for the 
rest of the time she might be near his mother 
she would do her numberless good turns. She 
would give things to the girls he had a private 
adumbration of that ; expensive Parisian, perhaps 
not perfectly useful things. 

Lady Agnes was a woman who measured reci 
procities and distances ; but she was both too 
subtle and too just not to recognize the smallest 
manifestation that might count, either technically 
or essentially, as a service. " Dear Julia ! " she 



 1 05 

exclaimed, responsively ; and her tone made this 
brevity of acknowledgment sufficient. What Julia 
had said was all she wanted. " It s so interesting 
about Harsh," she added. " We re immensely 
excited." 

" Yes, Nick looks it. Merci, pas de vin. It s 
just the thing for you, you know." 

" To be sure he knows it. He s immensely 
grateful. It s really very kind of you." 

" You do me a very great honor, Julia," said 
Nick. 

" Don t be tiresome ! " exclaimed Mrs. Dallow. 

" We 11 talk about" it later. Of course there 
are lots of points," Nick pursued. " At present 
let us be purely convivial. Somehow Harsh is 
such a false note here. A tout a 1 heure ! " 

" My dear fellow, you ve caught exactly the 
tone of Mr. Gabriel Nash," Peter Sherringham 
observed. 

"Who is Mr. Gabriel Nash?" Mrs. Dallow 
asked. 

" Nick, is he a gentleman ? Biddy says so," 
Grace Dormer interposed before this inquiry was 
answered. 

" It is to be supposed that any one Nick brings 
to lunch with us " Lady Agnes murmured. 

" Ah, Grace, with your tremendous standard ! " 
her brother said ; while Peter Sherringham re 
plied to Julia that Mr. Nash was Nick s new Men 
tor or oracle ; whom, moreover, she should see, if 
she would come and have tea with him. 



IO6  

"I haven t the least desire to see him," Julia 
declared, " any more than I have to talk about 
Harsh and bore poor Peter." 

" Oh, certainly, dear, you would bore me," said 
Sherringham. 

" One thing at a time, then. Let us by all 
means be convivial. Only you must show me 
how," Mrs. Dallow went on to Nick. " What 
does he mean, cousin Agnes ? Does he want us 
to drain the wine-cup, to flash with repartee ? " 

"You ll do very well," said Nick. "You are 
charming, this evening." 

" Do go to Peter s, Julia, if you want something 
exciting. You ll see a marvelous girl," Biddy 
broke in, with her smile on Peter. 

" Marvelous for what ? " 

" For thinking she can act, when she can t," 
said the roguish Biddy. 

" Dear me, what people you all know ! I hate 
Peter s theatrical people." 

"And aren t you going home, Julia?" Lady 
Agnes inquired. 

" Home to the hotel ? " 

"Dear, no, to Harsh, to see about every 
thing." 

" I m in the midst of telegrams. I don t know 
yet." 

" I suppose there s no doubt they 11 have 
him," Lady Agnes decided to pursue. 

" Who will have whom ? " 

" Why, the local people and the party ; those 



 IO/ 

who invite a gentleman to stand. I m speaking 
of my son." 

" They 11 have the person I want them to have, 
I dare say. There are so many people in it, in 
one way or another, it s dreadful. I like the 
way you sit there," Mrs. Dallow added to Nick 
Dormer. 

" So do I," he smiled back at her ; and he 
thought she was charming now, because she was 
gay and easy and willing really, though she might 
plead incompetence, to understand how jocose a 
dinner in a pothouse in a foreign town might be. 
She was in good-humor, or she was going to be, 
and not grand, nor stiff, nor indifferent, nor 
haughty, nor any of the things that people who 
disliked her usually found her and sometimes 
even a little made him believe her. The spirit 
of mirth, in some cold natures, manifests itself 
not altogether happily ; their effort of recreation 
resembles too much the bath of the hippopota 
mus ; but when Mrs. Dallow put her elbows on 
the table, one felt she could be trusted to get 
them safely off again. 

For a family in mourning the dinner was lively ; 
the more so that before it was half over Julia had 
arranged that her brother, eschewing the inferior 
spectacle, should take the girls to the Theatre 
Fran^ais. It was her idea, and Nick had a 
chance to observe how an idea was apt to be not 
successfully controverted when it was Julia s. 
Even the programme appeared to have been pre- 



108 , 

arranged to suit it, just the thing for the cheek 
of the young person " II ne Faut Jurer de 
Rien " and " Mademoiselle de la Seigliere." 
Peter was all willingness, but it was Julia who 
settled it, even to sending for the newspaper (her 
brother, by a rare accident, was unconscious of 
the evening s bill), and to reassuring Biddy, who 
was happy but anxious, on the article of their not 
getting places, their being too late. Peter could 
always get places : a word from him, and the best 
box was at his disposal. She made him write the 
word on a card and saw that a messenger was 
dispatched with it to the Rue de Richelieu ; and 
all this was done without loudness or insistence, 
parenthetically and authoritatively. The box was 
bespoken ; the carriage, as soon as they had had 
their coffee, was found to be there ; Peter drove 
off in it with the girls, with the understanding 
that he was to send it back ; Nick sat waiting for 
it, over the finished repast, with the two ladies, 
and then his mother was relegated to it and con 
veyed to her apartments ; and all the while it 
was Julia who governed the succession of events. 
"Do be nice to her," Lady Agnes murmured to 
him, as he placed her in the vehicle at the door 
of the restaurant ; and he guessed that it gave 
her a comfort to have left him sitting there with 
Mrs. Dallow. 

Nick had every disposition to be nice to her ; 
if things went as she liked them, it was an 
acknowledgment of a certain force that was in 



 log 

her the force of assuming that they would. 
Julia had her differences some of them were 
much for the better ; and when she was in a mood 
like this evening s, liberally dominant, he was 
ready to encourage her assumptions. While they 
waited for the return of the carriage, which had 
rolled away with his mother, she sat opposite to 
him, with her elbows on the table, playing first 
with one and then with another of the objects 
that encumbered it ; after five minutes of which 
she exclaimed, " Oh, I say, we 11 go ! " and got 
up abruptly, asking for her jacket. He said some 
thing about the carriage having had orders to 
come back for them, and she replied, " Well, it 
can go away again ! " She added, " I don t want 
a carriage ; I want to walk ; " and in a moment 
she was out of the place, with the people at the 
tables turning round again and the caissiere sway 
ing in ler high seat. On the pavement of the 
boulevard she looked up and down : there were 
people it little tables, at the door ; there were 
people all over the broad expanse of the asphalt ; 
there was a profusion of light and a pervasion of 
sound ; and everywhere, though the establishment 
at which they had been dining was not in the 
thick of the fray, the tokens of a great traffic of 
pleasure, that night aspect of Paris which repre 
sents it as a huge market for sensations. Beyond 
the Boulevard des Capucines it flared through 
the warm evening like a vast bazaar ; and oppo 
site the Cafe Durand the Madeleine rose theatri- 



HO  

cal, a high, clever cticor, before the footlights of 
the Rue Royale. " Where shall we go, what 
shall we do ? " Mrs. Dallow asked, looking at her 
companion and somewhat to his surprise, as he 
had supposed that she only wanted to go home. 

" Anywhere you like. It s so warm we might 
drive, instead of going indoors. We might go to 
the Bois. That would be agreeable." 

" Yes, but it would n t be walking. However, 
that does n t matter. It s mild enough for any 
thing for sitting out, like all these people. 
And I Ve never walked in Paris at night : it 
would amuse me." 

Nick hesitated. " So it might, but it is n t par 
ticularly recommended to ladies." 

" I don t care, if it happens to suit me." 

" Very well, then, we 11 walk to the Bastille, if 
you like." 

Julia hesitated, on her side, still looking round 
her. 

" It s too far ; I m tired ; we 11 sit here." And 
she dropped beside an empty table, on the " ter 
race " of M. Durand. "This will do ; it s amus 
ing enough, and we can look at the Madeleine ; 
that s respectable. If we must have something, 
we ll have a madtre ; is that respectable? Not 
particularly ? So much the better. What are 
those people having ? Bocks ? Could n t we 
have bocks ? Are they very low ? Then I shall 
have one. I ve been so wonderfully good I ve 
been staying at Versailles : je me dois bien cela" 



, III 

She insisted, but pronounced the thin liquid in 
the tall glass very disgusting when it was brought. 
Nick was amazed, reflecting that it was not for 
such a discussion as this that his mother had 
left him with such complacency ; and indeed he 
too had, as she would have had, his share of 
perplexity, observing that nearly half an hour 
passed without his cousin s saying anything 
about Harsh. 

Mrs. Dallow leaned back against the lighted 
glass of the cafe, comfortable and beguiled, 
watching the passers, the opposite shops, the 
movement of the square in front of them. She 
talked about London, about the news written to 
her in her absence, about Cannes and the people 
she had seen there, about her poor sister-in-law 
and her numerous progeny, and two or three droll 
things that had happened at Versailles. She dis 
coursed considerably about herself, mentioning 
certain things she meant to do on her return to 
town, ier plans for the rest of the season. Her 
carriage came and stood there, and Nick asked if 
he should send it away ; to which she said, " No, 
let it stand a bit." She let it stand a long time, 
and then she told him to dismiss it : they would 
walk home. She took his arm and they went 
along the boulevard, on the right hand side, to 
the Rue de la Paix, saying little to each other 
during the transit ; and then they passed into the 
hotel and up to her rooms. All she had said on 
the way was that she was very tired of Paris. 



112  

There was a shaded lamp in her salon, but the 
windows were open, and the light of the street, 
with its undisturbing murmur, as if everything 
ran on india-rubber, came up through the inter 
stices of the balcony and made a vague glow and 
a flitting of shadows on the ceiling. Her maid 
appeared, busying herself a moment ; and when 
she had gone out Julia said suddenly to her com 
panion, " Should you mind telling me what s the 
matter with you ? " 

" The matter with me ? " 

" Don t you want to stand ? " 

" I 11 do anything to oblige you." 

" Why should you oblige me ? " 

" Why, is n t that the way people treat you ? " 
asked Nick. 

" They treat me best when they are a little 
serious." 

" My dear Julia, it seems to me I m serious 
enough. Surely it is n t an occasion to be so 
very solemn, the idea of going down into a stodgy 
little country town and talking a lot of rot." 

" Why do you call it rot ? " 

" Because I can think of no other name that, 
on the whole, describes it so well. You know 
the sort of thing. Come ! you ve listened to 
enough of it, first and last. One blushes for it 
when one sees it in print, in the local papers. 
The local papers ah, the thought of them 
makes me want to stay in Paris." 

" If you don t speak well it s your own fault ; 



 113 

you know how to, perfectly. And you usually 
do." 

" I always do, and that s what I m ashamed 
of. I speak beautifully. I Ve got the cursed 
humbugging trick of it. I can turn it on, a fine 
flood of it, at the shortest notice. The better it 
is the worse it is, the kind is so inferior. It has 
nothing to do with the truth or the search for 
it ; nothing to do with intelligence, or candor, or 
honor. It s an appeal to everything that for 
one s self one despises," the young man went on 
" to stupidity, to ignorance, to density, to the 
love of names and phrases, the love of hollow, 
idiotic words, of shutting the eyes tight and 
making a noise. Do men who respect each other 
or themselves talk to each other that way ? They 
know they would deserve kicking ! A man would 
blush to say to himself in the darkness of the 
night the things he stands up on a platform in 
the garish light of day to stuff into the ears 
of a nultitude whose intelligence he pretends 
that he esteems." Nick Dormer stood at one of 
the windows, with his hands in his pockets. He 
had been looking out, but as his words followed 
each other faster he turned toward Mrs. Dallow, 
who had dropped upon a sofa, with her face to 
the window. She had given her jacket and gloves 
to her maid, but had kept on her bonnet ; and 
she leaned forward a little as she sat, with her 
hands clasped together in her lap and her eyes 
upon her companion. The lamp, in a corner, was 



114  

so thickly veiled that the room was in tempered 
obscurity, lighted almost equally from the street, 
from the brilliant shop-fronts opposite. " There 
fore, why be sapient and solemn about it, like an 
editorial in a newspaper ? " Nick added, with a 
smile. 

She continued to look at him for a moment 
after he had spoken ; then she said : " If you 
don t want to stand, you have only to say so. 
You need n t give your reasons." 

" It s too kind of you to let me off that ! And 
then I m a tremendous fellow for reasons ; that s 
my strong point, don t you know ? I Ve a lot 
more besides those I ve mentioned, done up 
and ready for delivery. The odd thing is that 
they don t always govern my behavior. I rather 
think I do want to stand." 

" Then what you said just now was a speech," 
Mrs. Dallow rejoined. 

" A speech ? " 

"The rot, the humbug of the hustings." 

" No, those great truths remain, and a good 
many others. But an inner voice tells me I m in 
for it. And it will be much more graceful to em 
brace this opportunity, accepting your coopera 
tion, than to wait for some other and forfeit that 
advantage." 

" I shall be very glad to help you, anywhere," 
said Mrs. Dallow. 

" Thanks, awfully," murmured the young man, 
still standing there with his hands in his pockets. 



 115 

" You would do it best in your own place, and I 
have no right to deny myself such a help." 

Julia smiled at him for an instant. " I don t 
do it badly." 

" Ah, you re so political ! " 

" Of course I am ; it s the only decent thing 
to be. But I can only help you if you 11 help 
yourself. I can do a good deal, but I can t do 
everything. If you 11 work, I 11 work with you ; 
but if you are going into it with your hands in 
your pockets, I 11 have nothing to do with you." 
Nick instantly changed the position of these 
members and sank into a seat with his elbows on 
his knees. " You re very clever, but you must 
really take a little trouble. Things don t drop 
into people s mouths." 

i r n try I 11 try. I have a great incen 
tive," Nick said. 

" Of course you have." 

" My mother, my poor mother." Mrs. Dallow 
made &gt;\ slight exclamation, and he went on : 
" And of course, always, my father, dear man. 
My mother s even more political than you." 

" I dare say she is, and quite right ! " said Mrs. 
Dallow. 

" And she can t tell me a bit more than you 
can what she thinks, what she believes, what she 
desires." 

" Excuse me, I can tell you perfectly. There s 
one thing I always desire to keep out a Tory." 

" I see ; that s a great philosophy." 



Il6  

" It will do very well. And I desire the good 
of the country. I m not ashamed of that." 

" And can you give me an idea of what it is 
the good of the country ? " 

" I know perfectly what it is n t. It is n t 
what the Tories want to do." 

" What do they want to do ? " 

" Oh, it would take me long to tell you. All 
sorts of trash." 

" It would take you long, and it would take 
them longer ! All they want to do is to prevent 
us from doing. On our side, we want to pre 
vent them from preventing us. That s about as 
clearly as we all see it. So, on one side and 
the other, it s a beautiful, lucid, inspiring pro 
gramme." 

"I don t believe in you," Mrs. Dallow replied 
to this, leaning back on her sofa. 

" I hope not, Julia, indeed ! " He paused a 
moment, still with his face toward her and his 
elbows on his knees ; then he pursued : " You 
are a very accomplished woman and a very zeal 
ous one ; but you have n t an idea, you know 
to call an idea. What you mainly want is to be 
at the head of a political salon ; to start one, to 
keep it up, to make it a success." 

" Much you know me ! " Julia exclaimed ; but 
he could see, through the dimness, that she had 
colored a little. 

" You 11 have it, in time, but I won t come to 
it," Nick went on. 



 \\J 

" You can t come less than you do." 

" When I say you 11 have it, I mean you ve 
already got it. That s why I don t come." 

" I don t think you know what you mean," said 
Mrs. Dallow. " I have an idea that s as good as 
any of yours, any of those you have treated me 
to this evening, it seems to me the simple idea 
that one ought to do something or other for one s 
country." 

" Something or other certainly covers all the 
ground. There is one thing one can always do 
for one s country, which is not to be afraid." 

"Afraid of what?" 

Nick Dormer hesitated a moment, laughing ; 
then he said, " I 11 tell you another time. It s 
very well to talk so glibly of standing," he added ; 
"but it isn t absolutely foreign to the question 
that I have n t got the cash." 

" What did you do before ? " asked Mrs. Dallow. 

"The first time my father paid." 

" And the other time ? " 

" Oh, Mr. Carteret." 

"Your expenses won t be at all large; on the 
contrary," said Julia. 

" They sha n t be ; I shall look out sharp for 
that. I shall have the great Hutchby." 

" Of course ; but, you know, I want you to do 
it well." She paused an instant, and then: "Of 
course you can send the bill to me." 

" Thanks, awfully ; you re tremendously kind. 
I shouldn t think of that." Nick Dormer got up 



Il8  

as he said these words, and walked to the win 
dow again, his companion s eyes resting upon 
him as he stood for a moment with his back to 
her. " I shall manage it somehow," he went on. 

" Mr. Carteret will be delighted," said Julia. 

" I dare say, but I hate taking people s money." 

"That s nonsense, when it s for the country. 
Is n t it for them ?" 

" When they get it back ! " Nick replied, turn 
ing round and looking for his hat. " It s start- 
lingly late ; you must be tired." Mrs. Dallow 
made no response to this, and he pursued his 
quest, successful only when he reached a duskier 
corner of the room, to which the hat had been 
relegated by his cousin s maid. " Mr. Carteret 
will expect so much, if he pays. And so would 
you." 

" Yes, I m bound to say I should ! " And 
Mrs. Dallow emphasized this assertion by the 
way she rose erect. " If you re only going in to 
lose it, you had better stay out" 

" How can I lose it, with you ? " the young 
man asked, smiling. She uttered a word, impa 
tiently but indistinguishably, and he continued : 
" And even if I do, it will have been immense 
fun." 

"It is immense fun," said Julia. " But the best 
fun is to win. If you don t " 

" If I don t ? " he repeated, as she hesitated. 

"I 11 never speak to you again." 

" How much you expect, even when you don t 
pay!" 



 II 9 

Mrs. Dallow s rejoinder was a justification of 
this remark, embodying as it did the fact that if 
they should receive on the morrow certain infor 
mation on which she believed herself entitled 
to count, information tending to show that the 
Tories meant to fight the seat hard, not to lose 
it again, she should look to him to be in the field 
as early as herself. Sunday was a lost day ; she 
should leave Paris on Monday. 

"Oh, they ll fight it hard; they ll put up 
Kingsbury," said Nick, smoothing his hat. 
" They 11 all come down all that can get away. 
And Kingsbury has a very handsome wife." 

" She is not so handsome as your cousin," 
Mrs. Dallow hazarded. 

" Oh dear, no a cousin sooner than a wife, 
any day ! " Nick laughed as soon as he had said 
this, as if the speech had an awkward side ; but 
the reparation perhaps scarcely mended it, the ex 
aggerated mock-meekness with which he added : 
" I 11 do any blessed thing you tell me." 

"Come here to-morrow, then, as early as ten." 
She turned round, moving to the door with him ; 
but before they reached it she demanded, ab 
ruptly : " Pray, is n t a gentleman to do anything, 
to be anything ? " 

" To be anything ? " 

" If he does n t aspire to serve the state." 

" To make his political fortune, do you mean ? 
Oh, bless me, yes, there are other things." 

" What other things, that can compare with 
that?" 



I2O  

"Well, I, for instance, I m very fond of the 
arts." 
" Of the arts ? " 

" Did you never hear of the-m ? I m awfully 
fond of painting." 

At this Mrs. Dallow stopped short, and her 
fine gray eyes had for a moment the air of be 
ing set further forward in her head. " Don t be 
odious ! Good-night," she said, turning away and 
leaving him to go. 



VII. 

PETER SHERRINGHAM, the next day, reminded 
Nick that he had promised to be present with him 
at Madame Carre s interview with the ladies in 
troduced to her by Gabriel Nash ; and in the after 
noon, in accordance with this arrangement, the 
two men took their way to the Rue de Constan 
tinople. They found Mr. Nash and his friends 
in the small beflounced drawing-room of the 
old actress, who, as they learned, had sent in a 
request for ten minutes grace, having been de 
tained at a lesson a rehearsal of a comedie de 
salon, to be given, for a charity, by a fine lady, at 
which she had consented to be present as an ad 
viser. Mrs. Rooth sat on a black satin sofa, with 
her daughter beside her, and Gabriel Nash wan 
dered about the room, looking at the votive offer 
ings which converted the little paneled box, de 
corated in sallow white and gold, into a theatrical 
museum : the presents, the portraits, the wreaths, 
the diadems, the letters, framed and glazed, the 
trophies and tributes and relics collected by Ma 
dame Carre during half a century of renown. The 
profusion of this testimony was hardly more strik 
ing than the confession of something missed, 
something hushed, which seemed to rise from it 



122 THE TRAGIC MUSK. 

all and make it melancholy, like a reference to 
clappings which, in the nature of things, could 
now only be present as a silence : so that if the 
place was full of history, it was the form without 
the fact, or at the most a redundancy of the one 
to a pinch of the other the history of a mask, 
of a squeak, a record of movements in the air. 

Some of the objects exhibited by the distin 
guished artist, her early portraits, in lithograph 
or miniature, represented the costume and em 
bodied the manner of a period so remote that 
Nick Dormer, as he glanced at them, felt a quick 
ened curiosity to look at the woman who recon 
ciled being alive to-day with having been alive so 
long ago. Peter Sherringham already knew how 
she managed this miracle, but every visit he paid 
to her added to his amused, charmed sense that 
it was a miracle, and his extraordinary old friend 
had seen things that he should never, never see. 
Those were just the things he wanted to see 
most, and her duration, her survival, cheated him 
agreeably and helped him a little to guess them. 
His appreciation of the actor s art was so syste 
matic that it had an antiquarian side, and at the 
risk of representing him as attached to a futility 
it must be said that he had as yet hardly known 
a keener regret for anything than for the loss of 
that antecedent world, and in particular for his 
having come too late for the great comedienne, 
the light of the French stage in the early years 
of the century, of whose example and instruction 



 123 

Madame Carre had had the inestimable benefit. 
She had often described to him her rare prede 
cessor, straight from whose hands she had re 
ceived her most celebrated parts, and of whom 
her own manner was often a religious imitation ; 
but her descriptions troubled him more than they 
consoled, only confirming his theory, to which so 
much of his observation had already ministered, 
that the actor s art, in general, is going down and 
down, descending a slope with abysses of vulgar 
ity at its foot, after having reached its perfection, 
more than fifty years ago, in the talent of the 
lady in question. He would have liked to dwell 
for an hour beneath the meridian. 

Gabriel Nash introduced the new-comers to his 
companions ; but the younger of the two ladies 
gave no sign of lending herself to this transac 
tion. The girl was very white ; she huddled 
there, silent and rigid, frightened to death, star 
ing, expressionless. If Bridget Dormer had seen 
her a: this moment she might have felt avenged 
for the discomfiture she had suffered the day 
before, at the Salon, under the challenging eyes 
of Maud Vavasour. It was plain at the present 
hour, that Miss Vavasour would have run away 
had she not felt that the persons present would 
prevent her escape. Her aspect made Nick 
Dormer feel as if the little temple of art in which 
they were collected bad been the waiting-room 
of a dentist. Sherringham had seen a great 
many nervous girls trembling before the same 



124  

ordeal, and he liked to be kind to them, to say 
things that would help them to do themselves 
justice. The probability, in a given case, was al 
most overwhelmingly in favor of their having any 
other talent one could think of in a higher degree 
than the dramatic ; but he could rarely forbear 
to interpose, even as against his conscience, to 
keep the occasion from being too cruel. There 
were occasions indeed that could scarcely be too 
cruel to punish properly certain examples of pre 
sumptuous ineptitude. He remembered what 
Mr. Nash had said about this blighted maiden, 
and perceived that though she might be inept she 
was now anything but presumptuous. Gabriel 
fell to talking with Nick Dormer, and Peter ad 
dressed himself to Mrs. Rooth. There was no 
use as yet in saying anything to the girl ; she was 
too scared even to hear. Mrs. Rooth, with her 
shawl fluttering about her, nestled against her 
daughter, putting out her hand to take one of 
Miriam s, soothingly. She had pretty, silly, near 
sighted eyes, a long, thin nose and an upper lip 
which projected over the under as an ornamental 
cornice rests on its support. " So much depends 
- really everything ! " she said in answer to 
some sociable observation of Sherringham s. 
" It s either this," and she rolled her eyes expres 
sively about the room, " or it s I don t know 
what ! " 

" Perhaps we re too many," Peter hazarded, to 
her daughter. " But really, you 11 find, after you 



 12$ 

fairly begin, that you 11 do better with four or 
five." 

Before she answered she turned her head and 
lifted her fine eyes. The next instant he saw 
they were full of tears. The word she spoke, 
however, though uttered in a deep, serious tone, 
had not the note of sensibility : " Oh, I don t care 
for you!" He laughed, at this, declared it was 
very well said, and that if she could give Madame 
Carre such a specimen as that ! The actress 
came in before he had finished his phrase, and he 
observed the way the girl slowly got up to meet 
her, hanging her head a little and looking at her 
from under her brows. There was no sentiment 
in her face only a kind of vacancy of terror 
which had not even the merit of being fine of its 
kind, for it seemed stupid and superstitious. Yet 
the head was good, he perceived at the same mo 
ment it was strong and salient and made to tell 
at a cistance. Madame Carre scarcely noticed 
her at first, greeting her only in her order, with 
the others, and pointing to seats, composing the 
circle with smiles and gestures, as if they were 
all before the prompter s box. The old actress 
presented herself to a casual glance as a red-faced 
woman in a wig, with beady eyes, a hooked nose 
and pretty hands ; but Nick Dormer, who had a 
perception of physiognomy, speedily observed that 
these free characteristics included a great deal of 
delicate detail an eyebrow, a nostril, a flitting 
of expressions, as if a multitude of little facial 



126  

wires were pulled from within. This accom 
plished artist had in particular a mouth which 
was visibly a rare instrument, a pair of lips whose 
curves and fine corners spoke of a lifetime of 
" points " unerringly made and verses exquisitely 
spoken, helping to explain the purity of the 
sound that issued from them. Her whole coun 
tenance had the look of long service of a thing 
infinitely worn and used, drawn and stretched to 
excess, with its elasticity overdone and its springs 
relaxed, yet religiously preserved and kept in re 
pair, like an old valuable time-piece, which might 
have quivered and rumbled, but could be trusted 
to strike the hour. At the first words she spoke 
Gabriel Nash exclaimed, endearingly, " Ah, la voix 
de Celimene ! " Celimene, who wore a big red 
flower on the summit of her dense wig, had a 
very grand air, a toss of the head and sundry 
little majesties of manner ; in addition to which 
she was strange, almost grotesque, and to some 
people would have been even terrifying, capable of 
reappearing, with her hard eyes, as a queer vision 
in the darkness. She excused herself for having 
made the company wait, and mouthed and mim 
icked in the drollest way, with intonations as fine 
as a flute, the performance and the pretensions 
of the belles dames to whom she had just been 
endeavoring to communicate a few of the rudi 
ments. "Mais celles-la, c est une plaisanterie," 
she went on, to Mrs. Rooth ; " whereas you and 
your daughter, chtre madame I am sure that 
you are quite another matter." 



 127 

The girl had got rid of her tears, and was gaz 
ing at her, and Mrs. Rooth leaned forward and 
said insinuatingly : " She knows four languages." 

Madame Carre" gave one of her histrionic 
stares, throwing back her head. " That s three 
too many. The thing is to do something with 
one of them." 

" We re very much in earnest," continued 
Mrs. Rooth, who spoke excellent French. 

" I m glad to hear it il n y a que qa. La 
tete est bien the head is very good," she said, 
looking at the girl. " But let us see, my dear 
child, what you ve got in it ! " The young lady 
was still powerless to speak ; she opened her lips, 
but nothing came. With the failure of this effort 
she turned her deep, sombre eyes upon the three 
men. " Un bean regard it carries well," Ma 
dame Carre hinted. But even as she spoke Miss 
Rooth 3 fine gaze was suffused again, and the 
next moment she had begun to weep. Nick 
Dormer sprung up ; he felt embarrassed and in 
trusive there was such an indelicacy in sitting 
there to watch a poor girl s struggle with timidity. 
There was a momentary confusion ; Mrs. Rooth s 
tears were seen also to flow ; Gabriel Nash began 
to laugh, addressing, however, at the same time, 
the friendliest, most familiar encouragement to 
his companions, and Peter Sherringham offered 
to retire with Nick on the spot, if their presence 
was oppressive to the young lady. But the agi 
tation was over in a minute ; Madame Carre mo- 



128  

tioned Mrs. Rooth out of her seat and took her 
place beside the girl, and Gabriel Nash explained 
judiciously to the other men that she would be 
worse if they were to go away. Her mother 
begged them to remain, " so that there should be 
at least some English ;" she spoke as if the old 
actress were an army of Frenchwomen. The 
girl was quickly better, and Madame Carre, on 
the sofa beside her, held her hand and emitted a 
perfect music of reassurance. " The nerves, the 
nerves they are half of our trade. Have as 
many as you like, if you ve got something else 
too. Voyons do you know anything ? " 

" I know some pieces." 

" Some pieces of the repertoire? " 

Miriam Rooth stared as if she did n t under 
stand. " I know some poetry." 

" English, French, Italian, German," said her 
mother. 

Madame Carre" gave Mrs. Rooth a look which 
expressed irritation at the recurrence of this an 
nouncement. " Does she wish to act in all 
those tongues ? The phrase-book is n t the 
comedy ! " 

" It is only to show you how she has been edu 
cated." 

" Ah, chere madame, there is no education that 
matters ! I mean save the right one. Your 
daughter must have a language, like me, like ces 
messieurs." 

"You see if I can speak French," said the girl, 



 1 29 

smiling dimly at her hostess. She appeared now 
almost to have collected herself. 

" You speak it in perfection." 

"And English just as well," said Miss Rooth. 

" You oughtn t to be an actress ; you ought to 
be a governess." 

" Oh, don t tell us that : it s to escape from 
that ! " pleaded Mrs. Rooth. 

" I m very sure your daughter will escape 
from that," Peter Sherringham was moved to 
remark. 

"Oh, if you could help her ! " the lady ex 
claimed, pathetically. 

" She has certainly all the qualities that strike 
the eye," said Peter. 

" You are most kind, sir ! " Mrs. Rooth de 
clared, elegantly draping herself. 

" She knows Celimene ; I have heard her do 
Celimene," Gabriel Nash said to Madame Carre". 

"And she knows Juliet, and Lady Macbeth, 
and Cleopatra," added Mrs. Rooth. 

" Voyons, my dear child, do you wish to work 
for the French stage or for the English ? " the 
old actress demanded. 

" Ours would have sore need of you, Miss 
Rooth," Sherringham gallantly interposed. 

" Could you speak to any one in London 
could you introduce her ? " her mother eagerly 
asked. 

" Dear madam, I must hear her first, and heat 
what Madame Carre says." 



130  

" She has a voice of rare beauty, and I under 
stand voices," said Mrs. Rooth. 

" Ah, then, if she has intelligence, she has 
every gift." 

" She has a most poetic mind," the old lady 
went on. 

" I should like to paint her portrait ; she s 
made for that," Nick Dormer ventured to observe 
to Mrs. Rooth ; partly because he was struck with 
the girl s capacity as a model, partly to mitigate 
the crudity of inexpressive spectatorship. 

" So all the artists say. I have had three or 
four heads of her, if you would like to see them : 
she has been done in several styles. If you were 
to do her I am sure it would make her cele 
brated." 

" And me too," said Nick, laughing. 

" It would indeed, a member of Parliament ! " 
Nash declared. 

" Ah, I have the honour ? " murmured Mrs. 
Rooth, looking gratified and mystified. 

Nick explained that she had no honour at all, 
and meanwhile Madame Carre had been question 
ing the girl. " Chere madame, I can do nothing 
with your daughter ; she knows too much ! " she 
broke out. " It s a pity, because I like to catch 
them wild." 

" Oh, she s wild enough, if that s all ! And 
that s the very point, the question of where to 
try," Mrs. Rooth went on. " Into what do I 
launch her upon what dangerous, stormy sea? 
I Ve thought of it so anxiously." 



 131 

w Try here try the French public : they re so 
much the most serious," said Gabriel Nash. 

" Ah, no, try the English : there s such a rare 
opening! " Sherringham exclaimed, in quick oppo 
sition. 

" Ah, it is n t the public, dear gentlemen. It s 
the private side, the other people it s the life 
it s the moral atmosphere." 

" Je ne connais qu une scene la notre," Ma 
dame Carre asserted. " I have been informed 
there is no other." 

" And very correctly," said Gabriel Nash. 
" The theatre in our countries is puerile and bar 
barous." 

"There is something to be done for it, and per 
haps mademoiselle is the person to do it," Sher 
ringham suggested, contentiously. 

" Ah, but, en attendant , what can it do for 
her ? " Madame Carre asked. 

" Well, anything that I can help it to do," said 
Peter Sherringham, who was more and more 
struck with the girl s rich type. Miriam Rooth 
sat in silence, while this discussion went on, look 
ing from one speaker to the other with a sus 
pended, literal air. 

" Ah, if your part is marked out, I congratu 
late you, mademoiselle ! " said the old actress, 
underlining the words as she had often under 
lined such words on the stage. She smiled with 
large permissiveness on the young aspirant, who 
appeared not to understand her. Her tone pene- 



132 -  

trated, however, to certain depths in the mother s 
nature, adding another stir to agitated waters. 

" I feel the responsibility of what she shall find 
in the life, the standards, of the theatre," Mrs. 
Rooth explained. "Where is the purest tone 
where are the highest standards ? that s what I 
ask," the good lady continued, with a persistent 
candor which elicited a peal of unceremonious 
but sociable laughter from Gabriel Nash. 

" The purest tone qii est-ce-que-c est que $a ? " 
Madame Carre demanded, in the finest manner 
of modern comedy. 

"We are very, very respectable," Mrs. Rooth 
went on, smiling and achieving lightness, too. 
" What I want to do is to place my daughter 
where the conduct and the picture of conduct, 
in which she should take part wouldn t be 
absolutely dreadful. Now, chere madame, how 
about all that ; how about the conduct in the 
French theatre the things she should see, the 
things she should hear ? " 

"I don t think I know what you are talking 
about. They are the things she may see and 
hear everywhere ; only they are better done, they 
are better said. The only conduct that concerns 
an actress, it seems to me, is her own, and the 
only way for her to behave herself is not to be a 
stick. I know no other conduct." 
. " But there are characters, there are situations, 
which I don t think I should like to see ^r un 
dertake." 



 133 

" There are many, no doubt, which she would 
do well to leave alone ! " laughed the French 
woman. 

" I should n t like to see her represent a very 
bad woman a really bad one," Mrs. Rooth se 
renely pursued. 

" Ah, in England, then, and in your theatre, 
every one is good ? Your plays must be even 
more ingenious than I supposed ! " 

" We have n t any plays," said Gabriel Nash. 

" People will write them for Miss Rooth it 
will be a new era," Peter Sherringham rejoined, 
with wanton, or at any rate combative optimism. 

" Will you, sir will you do something ? A 
sketch of some truly noble female type ? " the old 
lady asked, engagingly. 

" Oh, I know what you do with our pieces 
to show your superior virtue ! " Madame Carre 
broke in, before he had time to reply that he 
wrote i othing but diplomatic memoranda. "Bad 
women 3 Je n ai joue que ga, madame. Really 
bad ? I tried to make them real ! " 

" I can say L Aventuriere, " Miriam inter 
rupted, in a cold voice which seemed to hint at a 
want of participation in the maternal solicitudes. 

" Confer on us the pleasure of hearing you, 
then. Madame Carre will give yo.u the replique" 
said Peter Sherringham. 

" Certainly, my child ; I can say it without the 
book," Madame Carre responded. " Put yourself 
there move that chair a little away." She 



134  

patted her young visitor, encouraging her to rise, 
settling with her the scene they should take, 
while the three men sprang up to arrange a place 
for the performance. Miriam left her seat and 
looked vaguely round her ; then, having taken off 
her hat and given it to her mother, she stood on 
the designated spot with her eyes on the ground. 
Abruptly, however, instead of beginning the 
scene, Madame Carre turned to the elder lady 
with an air which showed that a rejoinder to this 
visitor s remarks of a moment before had been 
gathering force in her breast. 

"You mix things up, chere madame, and I 
have it on my heart to tell you so. I believe it s 
rather the case with you other English, and I 
have never been able to learn that either your 
morality or your talent is the gainer by it. To 
be too respectable to go where things are done 
best is, in my opinion, to be very vicious indeed ; 
and to do them badly in order to preserve your 
virtue is to fall into a grossness more shocking 
than any other. To do them well is virtue 
enough, and not to make a mess of it the only re 
spectability. That s hard enough to merit Para 
dise. Everything else is base humbug! Voila 
chh e madame, the answ.er I have for your scru 
ples ! " 

"It s admirable admirable; and I am glad 
my friend Dormer here has had the great ad 
vantage of hearing you utter it ! " Gabriel Nash 
exclaimed, looking at Nick. 



 135 

Nick thought it, in effect, a speech denoting an 
intelligence of the question, but he rather re 
sented the idea that Nash should assume that it 
would strike him as a revelation ; and to show his 
familiarity with the line of thought it indicated, 
as well as to play his part appreciatively in the 
little circle, he observed to Mrs. Rooth, as if they 
might take many things for granted : " In other 
words, your daughter must find her safeguard in 
the artistic conscience." But he had no sooner 
spoken than he was struck with the oddity of 
their discussing so publicly, and under the poor 
girl s nose, the conditions which Miss Rooth 
might find the best for the preservation of her 
personal integrity. However, the anomaly was 
light and unoppressive the echoes of a public 
discussion of delicate questions seemed to linger 
so familiarly in the egotistical little room. More 
over the heroine of -the occasion evidently was 
losing .ier embarrassment ; she was the priestess 
on the tripod, awaiting the afflatus and thinking 
only of that. Her bared head, of which she had 
changed the position, holding it erect, while her 
arms hung at her sides, was admirable ; and her 
eyes gazed straight out of the window, at the 
houses on the opposite side of the Rue de Con 
stantinople. 

Mrs. Rooth had listened to Madame Carre with 
startled, respectful attention, but Nick, consider 
ing her, was very sure that she had not under 
stood her hostess s little lessan. Yet this did 



136  

not prevent her from exclaiming in answer to 
him: "Oh, a fine artistic life what indeed is 
more beautiful ? " 

Peter Sherringham had said nothing ; he was 
watching Miriam and her attitude. She wore a 
black dress, which fell in straight folds ; her face, 
under her mobile brows, was pale and regular, 
with a strange, strong, tragic beauty. " I don t 
know what s in her," he said to himself; " noth 
ing, it would seem, from her persistent vacancy. 
But such a face as that, such a head, is a for 
tune ! " Madame Carre made her commence, 
giving her the first line of the speech of Clorinde : 
" Vous ne me fuyez pas, mon enfant, aujourd hui." 
But still the girl hesitated, and for an instant she 
appeared to make a vain, convulsive effort. In 
this effort she frowned portentously ; her low 
forehead overhung her eyes ; the eyes themselves, 
in shadow, stared, splendid and cold, and her 
hands clinched themselves at her sides. She 
looked austere and terrible, and during this mo 
ment she was an incarnation the vividness of 
which drew from Sherringham a stifled cry. 
" Elle est bien belle ah, ^a!" murmured the old 
actress ; and in the pause which still preceded 
the issue of sound from the girl s lips Peter, 
turned to his kinsman, and said in alow tone : 

"You must paint her just like that." 

" Like that ? " 

"As the Tragic Muse." 

She began to speak ; a long, strong, colorless 



 137 

voice came quavering from her young throat. 
She delivered the lines of Clorinde, in the fine 
interview with Celie, in the third act of the play, 
with a rude monotony, and then, gaining confi 
dence, with an effort at modulation which was 
not altogether successful and which evidently 
she felt not to be so. Madame Carre sent back 
the ball without raising her hand, repeating the 
speeches of Celie, which her memory possessed 
from their having so often been addressed to her, 
and uttering the verses with soft, communicative 
art. So they went on through the scene, and 
when it was over it had not precisely been a 
triumph for Miriam Rooth. Sherringham for 
bore to look at Gabriel Nash, and Madame Carre" 
said : " I think you have a voice, ma fille, some 
where or other. We must try and put our hand 
on it." Then she asked her what instruction she 
had had, and the girl, lifting her eyebrows, 
looked at her mother, while her mother prompted 
her. 

" Mrs. Delamere, in London ; she was once an 
ornament of the English stage. She gives les 
sons just to a very few ; it s a great favour. Such 
a very nice person ! But above all, Signor Rug- 
gieri I think he taught us most." Mrs. Rooth 
explained that this gentleman was an Italian 
tragedian, in Rome, who instructed Miriam in 
the proper manner of pronouncing his language, 
and also in the art of declaiming and gesticu 
lating. 



138  

" Gesticulating, I 11 warrant ! " declared their 
hostess. " They mimic as if for the deaf, they 
emphasize as if for the blind. Mrs. Delamere is 
doubtless an epitome of all the virtues, but I 
never heard of her. You travel too much," Ma 
dame Carre went on ; " that s very amusing, but 
the way to study is to stay at home, to shut your 
self up and hammer at your scales." Mrs. Rooth 
complained that they had no home to stay at ; 
in rejoinder to which the old actress exclaimed, 
" Oh, you English, you are cCiine Ugtrett a faire 
rougir. If you have n t a home, you must make 
one. In our profession it s the first requisite." 

" But where ? That s what I ask ! " said Mrs. 
Rooth. 

"Why not here? " Sherringham inquired. 

" Oh, here ! " And the good lady shook her 
head, with a world of suggestions. 

"Come and live in London, and then I shall 
be able to paint your daughter," Nick Dormer 
interposed. 

" Is that all that it will take, my dear fellow ? " 
asked Gabriel Nash. 

"Ah, London is full of memories," Mrs. Rooth 
went on. " My father had a great house there 
we always came up. But all that s over." 

" Study here, and go to London to appear," 
said Peter Sherringham, feeling frivolous even as 
he spoke. 

"To appear in French ? " 

"No, in the language of Shakespeare." 



 139 

" But we can t study that here." 

" M. Sherringham means that he will give 
you lessons," Madame Carre explained. " Let me 
not fail to say it he s an excellent critic." 

"How do you know that you who are per 
fect ? " asked Sherringham : an inquiry to which 
the answer was forestalled by the girl s rousing 
herself to make it public that she could recite the 
" Nights " of Alfred de Musset. 

" Diable ! " said the actress, " that s more than 
I can ! But by all means give us a specimen." 

The girl again placed herself in position and 
rolled out a fragment of one of the splendid con 
versations of Musset s poet with his muse 
rolled it loudly and proudly, tossed it and tumbled 
it about the room. Madame Carre watched her at 
first, but after a few moments she shut her eyes, 
though the best part of the business was to look. 
Sherring-ham had supposed Miriam was abashed 
by the flatness of her first performance, but now 
he perceived that she could not have been con 
scious of this ; she was rather exhilarated and 
emboldened. She made a muddle of the divine 
verses, which, in spite of certain sonorities and 
cadences, an evident effort to imitate a celebrated 
actress, a comrade of Madame Carre, whom she 
had heard declaim them, she produced as if she 
had but a dim idea of their meaning. When she 
had finished, Madame Carre passed no judg 
ment ; she only said : " Perhaps you had better 
say something English." She suggested some 



J40  

little piece of verse some fable, if there were 
fables in English. She appeared but scantily sur 
prised to hear that there were not it was a 
language of which one expected so little. Mrs. 
Rooth said, " She knows her Tennyson by heart. 
I think he s more profound than La Fontaine ; " 
and after some deliberation and delay Miriam 
broke into "The Lotos-Eaters," from which she 
passed directly, almost breathlessly, to " Edward 
Gray." Sherringham had by this time heard her 
make four different attempts, and the only gen 
eralization which could be very present to him 
was that she uttered these dissimilar composi 
tions in exactly the same tone a solemn, dron 
ing, dragging measure, adopted with an intention 
of pathos, a crude idea of "style." It was fune 
real, and at the same time it was rough and child 
ish. Sherringham thought her English perfor 
mance less futile than her French, but he could 
see that Madame Carre listened to it with even 
less pleasure. In the way the girl wailed forth 
some of her Tennysonian lines he detected a pos 
sibility of a thrill. But the further she went, the 
more violently she acted on the nerves of Mr. 
Gabriel Nash : that also he could discover, from 
the way this gentleman ended by slipping dis 
creetly to the window and leaning there, with his 
head out and his back to the exhibition. He had 
the art of mute expression ; his attitude said, as 
clearly as possible, " No, no, you can t call me 
either ill-mannered or ill-natured. I m the show- 



 141 

man of the occasion, moreover, and I avert my 
self, leaving you to judge. If there s a thing in 
life I hate, it s this idiotic new fashion of the 
drawing - room recitation, and the insufferable 
creatures who practice it, who prevent conversa 
tion and whom, as they are beneath it, you can t 
punish by criticism. Therefore what I am is only 
too magnanimous bringing these benighted 
women here, paying with my person, stifling my 
just repugnance." 

At the same time that Sherringham pronounced 
privately that the manner in which Miss Rooth 
had acquitted herself offered no element of in 
terest, he remained conscious that something sur 
mounted and survived her failure, something that 
would perhaps be worth taking hold of. It was 
the element of outline and attitude, the way she 
stood, the way she turned her eyes, her head, 
and moved her limbs. These things held the at 
tention ; they had a natural felicity and, in spite 
of their suggesting too much the school-girl in 
the tableau-vivant, a sort of grandeur. Her face, 
moreover, grew as he watched it ; something del 
icate dawned in it, a dim promise of variety and 
a touching plea for patience, as if it were con 
scious of being able to show in time more expres 
sions than the simple and striking gloom which, 
as yet, had mainly graced it. In short, the plastic 
quality of her person was the only definite sign 
of a vocation. He almost hated to have to rec 
ognize this ; he had seen that quality so often 



142  

when it meant nothing at all that he had come at 
last to regard it as almost a guarantee of incom 
petence. He knew Madame Carre valued it, by 
itself, so little that she counted it out in measur 
ing an histrionic nature ; when it was not ac 
companied with other properties which helped 
and completed it she was near considering it as 
a positive hindrance to success success of the 
only kind that she esteemed. Far oftener than 
he, she had sat in judgment on young women for 
whom hair and eyebrows and a disposition for 
the statuesque would have worked the miracle of 
attenuating their stupidity if the miracle were 
workable. But that particular miracle never was. 
The qualities she deemed most interesting were 
not the gifts, but the conquests the effects the 
actor had worked hard for, had wrested by un 
wearying study. Sherringham remembered to 
have had, in the early part of their acquaintance, 
a friendly dispute with her on this subject ; he 
having been moved at that time to defend the 
cause of the gifts. She had gone so far as to say 
that a serious comedian ought to be ashamed of 
them ashamed of resting his case on them ; 
and when Sherringham had cited Mademoiselle 
Rachel as a great artist whose natural endow 
ment was rich and who had owed her highest 
triumphs to it, she had declared that Rachel was 
the very instance that proved her point a 
talent embodying one or two primary aids, a 
voice and an eye, but essentially formed by work, 



 143 

unremitting and ferocious work. " I don t care a 
straw for your handsome girls," she said ; " but 
bring me one who is ready to drudge the tenth 
part of the way Rachel drudged, and I 11 forgive 
her her beauty. Of course, notez bien, Rachel 
was n t a bete : that s a gift, if you like ! " 

Mrs. Rooth, who was evidently very proud of 
the figure her daughter had made, appealed to 
Madame Carre, rashly and serenely, for a verdict ; 
but fortunately this lady s voluble bonne came 
rattling in at the same moment with the tea-tray. 
The old actress busied herself in dispensing this 
refreshment, an hospitable attention to her Eng 
lish visitors, and under cover of the diversion 
thus obtained, while the others talked together, 
Sherringham said to his hostess : "Well, is there 
anything in her ? " 

" Nothing that I can see. She s loud and 
coarse." 

" She s very much afraid ; you must allow for 
that." 

" Afraid of me, immensely, but not a bit afraid 
of her authors nor of you!" added Madame 
Carre, smiling. 

" Are n t you prejudiced by what Mr. Nash has 
told you ? " 

"Why prejudiced ? He only told me she was 
very handsome." 

" And don t you think she is ?" 

" Admirable. But I m not a photographer nor 
a dressmaker. I can t do anything with that." 



144  

"The head is very noble," said Peter Sherring- 
ham. " And the voice, when she spoke English, 
had some sweet tones." 

" Ah, your English possibly ! All I can 
say is that I listened to her conscientiously, and 
I did n t perceive in what she did a single nuance, 
a single inflection or intention. But not one, mon 
cher. I don t think she s intelligent." 

" But don t they often seem stupid at first ? " 

" Say always ! " 

" Then don t some succeed even when they 
are handsome ? " 

" When they are handsome they always suc 
ceed in one way or another." 

" You don t understand us English," said Peter 
Sherringham. 

Madame Carre drank her tea ; then she re 
plied : " Marry her, my son, and give her dia 
monds. Make her an ambassadress ; she will look 
very well." 

" She interests you so little that you don t care 
to do anything for her ? " 

" To do anything ? " 

"To give her a few lessons." 

The old actress looked at him a moment ; after 
which, rising from her place near the table on 
which the tea had been served, she said to Miriam 
Rooth : " My dear child, I give my voice for the 
sckne anglaise. You did the English things best." 

" Did I do them well ? " asked the girl. 

" You have a great deal to learn ; but you have 



 145 

force. The principal things sont encore a dtgager, 
but they will come. You must work." 

" 1 think she has ideas," said Mrs. Rooth. 

" She gets them from you," Madame Carre re 
plied. 

" I must say, if it s to be our theatre I m re 
lieved. I think it s safer," the good lady con 
tinued. 

" Ours is dangerous, no doubt." 

"You mean you are more severe," said the 
girl. 

"Your mother is right," the actress smiled; 
"you have ideas." 

" But what shall we do then how shall we 
proceed ? " Mrs. Rooth inquired. 

She made this appeal, plaintively and vaguely, 
to the three gentlemen ; but they had collected, 
a few steps off, and were talking together, so 
that it failed to reach them. 

" Work work work ! " exclaimed the ac 
tress. 

" In English I can play Shakespeare. I want 
to play Shakespeare," Miriam remarked. 

" That s fortunate, as, in English, you have n t 
any one else to play." 

" But he s so great and he s so pure ! " said 
Mrs. Rooth. 

"That also seems very fortunate for you," 
Madame Carre phrased. 

" You think me actually pretty bad, don t you ? " 
the girl demanded, with her serious face. 



I 4 6  

" Mon Dieu, que vous dirai-je ? Of course 
you re rough ; but so was I, at your age. And 
if you find your voice it may carry you far. Be 
sides, what does it matter what I think ? How 
can I judge for your English public ? " 

" How shall I find my voice ? " asked Miriam 
Rooth. 

" By trying. II n y a que c^a. Work like a 
horse, night and day. Besides, M. Sherringham, 
as he says, will help you." 

Sherringham, hearing his name, turned round, 
and the girl appealed to him. " Will you help 
me, really ? " 

"To find her voice," Madame Carre interposed. 

"The voice, when it s worth anything, comes 
from the heart ; so I suppose that s where to 
look for it," Gabriel Nash suggested. 

" Much you know ; you have n t got any ! " Mir 
iam retorted, with the first scintillation of gayety 
she had shown on this occasion. 

" Any voice, my child ? " Mr. Nash inquired. 

" Any heart or any manners ! " 

Peter Sherringham made the secret reflection 
that he liked her better when she was lugubrious ; 
for the note of pertness was not totally absent 
from her mode of emitting these few words. He 
was irritated, moreover, for in the brief confer 
ence he had just had with the young lady s intro 
ducer he had had to face the necessity of saying 
something optimistic about her, which was not 
particularly easy. Mr. Nash had said with his 



 147 

bland smile, "And what impression does my 
young friend make?" to which it appeared to 
Sherringham that an uncomfortable consistency 
compelled him to reply that there was evidently 
a good deal in her. He was far from being sure 
of that ; at the same time, the young lady, both 
with the exaggerated "points " of her person and 
the poverty of her instinct of expression, consti 
tuted a kind of challenge presented herself to 
him as a subject for inquiry, a problem, a piece 
of work, an explorable country. She was too bad 
to jump at, and yet she was too individual to over 
look, especially when she rested her tragic eyes 
on him with the appeal of her deep " Really ?" 
This appeal sounded as if it were in a certain 
way to his honour, giving him a chance to brave 
verisimilitude, to brave ridicule even, a little, in 
order to show, in a special case, what he had al 
ways maintained in general, that the direction of 
a young person s studies for the stage may be an 
interest of as high an order as any other artistic 
consideration. 

" Mr. Nash has rendered us the great service 
of introducing us to Madame Carre, and I m sure 
we re immensely indebted to him," Mrs. Rooth 
said to her daughter, with an air affectionately 
corrective. 

" But what good does that do us ? " the girl 
asked, smiling at the actress and gently laying 
her finger-tips upon her hand. " Madame Carre 
listens to me with adorable patience, and then 



148  

sends me about my business in the prettiest 
way in the world." 

"Mademoiselle, you are not so rough; the 
tone of that is v&ry juste. A la bonne heure ; 
work work!" the actress exclaimed. "There 
was an inflection there, or very nearly. Practice 
it till you ve got it." 

" Come and practice it to me, if your mother 
will be so kind as to bring you," said Peter Sher- 
ringham. 

" Do you give lessons do you understand ? " 
Miriam asked. 

" I m an old play-goer, and I have an un 
bounded belief in my own judgment." 

" Old/ sir, is too much to say," Mrs. Rooth 
remonstrated. " My daughter knows your high 
position, but she is very direct. You will always 
find her so. Perhaps you 11 say there are less 
honourable faults. We 11 come to see you with 
pleasure. Oh, I ve been at the Embassy, when 
I was her age. Therefore why should n t she go 
to-day ? That was in Lord Davenant s time." 

" A few people are coming to tea with me to 
morrow. Perhaps you ll come then, at five 
o clock." 

" It will remind me of the dear old times," said 
Mrs. Rooth. 

" Thank you ; I 11 try and do better to-morrow," 
Miriam remarked, very sweetly. 

"You do better every minute! " Sherringham 
exclaimed, looking at Madame Carre in emphasis 
declaration. 



 149 

" She is finding her voice," the actress cried. 

11 She is finding a friend ! " Mrs. Rooth 
amended. 

" And don t forget, when you come to London, 
my hope that you 11 come and see me" Nick 
Dormer said to the girl. " To try and paint you 
that would do me good ! " 

" She is finding even two," said Madame 
Carre. 

" It s to make up for one I ve lost ! " And 
Miriam looked with very good stage-scorn at Ga 
briel Nash. " It s he who thinks I m bad." 

" You say that to make me drive you home ; 
you know it will," Nash returned. 

" We 11 all take you home ; why not ? " Sher- 
ringham asked. 

Madame Carre looked at the handsome girl, 
handsomer than ever at this moment, and at the 
three young men who had taken their hats and 
stood ready to accompany her. A deeper ex 
pression came for an instant into her hard, bright 
eyes, while she sighed, "Ah, la jeunesse ! you d 
always have that, my child, if you were the great 
est goose on earth ! " 



VIII. 

AT Peter Sherringham s, the next day, Miriam 
Rooth had so evidently come with the expecta 
tion of "saying" something that it was impossi 
ble such a patron of the drama should forbear to 
invite her, little as the exhibition at Madame 
Carre s could have contributed to render the in 
vitation prompt. His curiosity had been more 
appeased than stimulated, but he felt none the 
less that he had "taken up" the dark-browed girl 
and her reminiscential mother, and must face the 
immediate consequences of the act. This respon 
sibility weighed upon him during the twenty- 
four hours that followed the ultimate dispersal of 
the little party at the door of the Hotel de la 
Garonne. 

On quitting Madame Carre s the two ladies 
had gracefully declined Mr. Nash s offered cab 
and had taken their way homeward on foot, with 
the gentlemen in attendance. The streets of 
Paris at that hour were bright and episodical, and 
Sherringham trod them goocl-humoredly enough, 
and not too fast, leaning a little to talk to the 
young lady as he went. Their pace was regulated 
by her mother s, who walked in advance, on the 
arm of Gabriel Nash (Nick Dormer was on her 



 151 

other side), in refined deprecation. Her sloping 
back was before them, exempt from retentive 
stiffness in spite of her rigid principles, with the 
little drama of her lost and recovered shawl per 
petually going on. 

Sherringham said nothing to the girl about 
her performance or her powers ; their talk was 
only of her manner of life with her mother 
their travels, their pensions, their economies, 
their want of a home, the many cities she knew 
well, the foreign tongues and the wide view of 
the world she had acquired. He guessed easily 
enough the dolorous type of exile of the two la 
dies, wanderers in search of Continental cheap 
ness, inured to queer contacts and compromises, 
"remarkably well connected" in England, but 
going out for their meals. The girl was but in- 
j directly communicative, not, apparently, from any 
\ intention of concealment, but from the habit of 
j associating with people whom she didn t honour 
\ with hsr confidence. She was fragmentary and 
abrupt, as well as not in the least shy, subdued to 
dread of Madame Carre as she had been for the 
time. She gave Sherringham a reason for this 
fear, and he thought her reason innocently pre 
tentious. " She admired a great artist more than 
anything in the world ; and in the presence of 
art, of great art, her heart beat so fast." Her 
manners were not perfect, and the friction of a 
varied experience had rather roughened than 
smoothed her. She said nothing that showed 



152  

that she was clever, though he guessed that this 
was the intention of two or three of her remarks; 
but he parted from her with the suspicion that 
she was, according to the contemporary French 
phrase, a "nature." 

The Hotel de la Garonne was in a small, un- 
renovated street, in which the cobble-stones of 
old Paris still flourished, lying between the Av 
enue de 1 Opera and the Place de la Bourse. 
Sherringham had occasionally passed through 
this dim by-way, but he had never noticed the 
tall, stale maison mcnblec, whose aspect, that of a 
third-rate provincial inn, was an illustration of 
Mrs. Rooth s shrunken standard. 

" We would ask you to come up, but it s quite 
at the top, and we have n t a sitting-room," the 
poor lady bravely explained. " We had to receive 
Mr. Nash at a cafe." 

Nick Dormer declared that he liked cafes, and 
Miriam, looking at his cousin, dropped, with a 
flash of passion, the demand : " Do you wonder 
that I should want to do something, so that we 
can stop living like pigs ? " 

Sherringham recognized eventually, the next 
day, that though it might be rather painful to 
listen to her it was better to make her recite 
than to let her do nothing, so effectually did the 
presence of his sister and that of Lady Agnes, 
and even of Grace and Biddy, appear, by a sort 
of tacit opposition, to deprive hers, ornamental as 
it was, of a reason. He had only to see them all 



 153 

together to perceive that she couldn t pass for 
having come to " meet " them even her mo 
ther s insinuating gentility failed to put the occa 
sion on that footing and that she must there 
fore be assumed to have been brought to show 
them something. She was not subdued, not col 
orless enough to sit there for nothing, or even 
for conversation (the sort of conversation that 
was likely to come off), so that it was inevitable 
to treat her position as connected with the prin 
cipal place on the carpet, with silence and atten 
tion and the pulling together of chairs. Even 
when so established it struck him at first as 
precarious, in the light, or the darkness, of the 
inexpressive faces of the other ladies, sitting in 
couples and rows on sofas (there were several in 
addition to Julia and the Dormers ; mainly the 
wives, with their husbands, of Sherringham s fel 
low-secretaries), scarcely one of whom he felt 
that he might count upon to say something gush 
ing* wh2n the girl should have finished. 

Miss Rooth gave a representation of Juliet 
drinking her potion, according to the system, as 
her mother explained, of the famous Signer Rug- 
gieri a scene of high, fierce sound, of many 
cries and contortions : she shook her hair (which 
proved magnificent) half down before the perfor 
mance was over. Then she declaimed several 
short poems by Victor Hugo, selected, among 
many hundred, by Mrs. Rooth, as the good lady 
was careful to make known. After this she 



154  

jumped to the American lyre, regaling the com 
pany with specimens, both familiar and fresh, of 
Longfellow, Lowell, Whittier, Holmes, and of 
two or three poetesses revealed to Sherringham 
on this occasion. She flowed so copiously, keep 
ing the floor and rejoicing visibly in her oppor 
tunity, that Sherringham was mainly occupied 
with wondering how he could make her leave off. 
He was surprised at the extent of her repertory, 
which, in view of the circumstance that she could 
never have received much encouragement it 
must have come mainly from her mother, and he 
did n t believe in Signor Ruggieri denoted a 
very stiff ambition and a kind of illuminated per 
severance. It was her mother who checked her 
at last, and he found himself suspecting that Ga 
briel Nash had intimated to the old woman that 
interference was necessary. For himself, he was 
chiefly glad that Madame Carre was not there. 
It was present to him that she would have 
deemed the exhibition, with its badness, its assur 
ance, the absence of criticism, almost indecent. 

His only new impression of the girl was that 
of this same high assurance her coolness, her 
complacency, her eagerness to go on. She had 
been deadly afraid of the old actress, but she was 
not a bit afraid of a cluster oifemmes du monde, 
of Julia, of Lady Agnes, of the smart women of 
the Embassy. It was positively these personages 
who were rather frightened ; there was certainly 
a moment when even Julia was scared, for the 



 155 

first time that he had ever seen her. The space 
was too small ; the cries, the rushes of the di 
sheveled girl were too near. Lady Agnes, much 
of the time, wore the countenance she might 
have worn at the theatre during a play in which 
pistols were fired ; and indeed the manner of the 
young reciter had become more spasmodic, more 
explosive. It appeared, however, that the com 
pany in general thought her very clever and suc 
cessful ; which showed, to Sherringham s sense, 
how little they understood the matter. Poor 
Biddy was immensely struck, and grew flushed 
and absorbed in proportion as Miriam, at her best 
moments, became pale and fatal. It was she who 
spoke to her first, after it was agreed that they 
had better not fatigue her any more ; she ad 
vanced a few steps, happening to be near her, 
murmuring, "Oh, thank you, thank you so much. 
I never saw anything so beautiful, so grand." 

She looked very red and very pretty as she 
said this. Peter Sherringham liked her enough 
to notice and to like her better when she looked 
prettier than usual. As he turned away he heard 
Miriam answer, with rather an ungracious irrele 
vance : " I have seen you before, two days ago, 
at the Salon, with Mr. Dormer. Yes, I know 
he s your brother. I have made his acquaintance 
since. He wants to paint my portrait. Do you 
I think he 11 do it well ? " He was afraid Miriam 
was something of a brute, and also somewhat 
j grossly vain. This impression would perhaps 



156  

have been confirmed if a part of the rest of the 
short conversation of the two girls had reached 
his ear. Biddy ventured to remark that she her 
self had studied modeling a little and that she 
could understand how any artist would think 
Miss Rooth a splendid subject. If, indeed, she 
could attempt her head, that would be a chance 
to do something. 

" Thank you," said Miriam, with a laugh. " I 
think I had rather not passer par toute la famille /" 
Then she added, " If your brother s an artist, I 
don t understand how he s in Parliament." 

" Oh, he is n t in Parliament now ; we only 
hope he will be." 

" Oh, I see." 

"And he isn t an artist, either," Biddy felt 
herself conscientiously bound to subjoin. 

"Then he is n t anything," said Miss Rooth. 

"Well he s immensely clever." 

" Oh, I see," Miss Rooth again replied. " Mr. 
Nash has puffed him up so." 

" I don t know Mr. Nash," said Biddy, guilty 
of a little dryness, and also of a little misrepre 
sentation, and feeling rather snubbed. 

" Well, you need n t wish to." 

Biddy stood with her a moment longer, still 
looking at her and not knowing what to say next, 
but not finding her any less handsome because she 
had such odd manners. Biddy had an ingenious 
little mind, which always tried as much as pos 
sible to keep different things separate. It was 



 157 

pervaded now by the observation, made with a 
certain relief, that if the girl spoke to her with 
such unexpected familiarity of Nick, she said 
nothing at all about Peter. Two gentlemen came 
up, two of Peter s friends, and made speeches to 
Miss Rooth of the kind, Biddy supposed, that 
people learned to make in Paris. It was also 
doubtless in Paris, the girl privately reasoned, 
that they learned to listen to them as this strik 
ing performer listened. She received their ad 
vances very differently from the way she had re 
ceived Biddy s. Sherringham noticed his young 
kinswoman turn away, still blushing, to go and 
sit near her mother again, leaving Miriam engaged 
with the two men. It appeared to have come 
over Biddy that for a moment she had been 
strangely spontaneous and bold and had paid a 
little of the penalty. The seat next her mother 
was occupied by Mrs. Rooth, toward whom Lady 
Agnes s head had inclined itself with a preoccu 
pied air of benevolence. He had an idea that 
Mrs. Rcoth was telling her about the Neville- 
Nugents of Castle Nugent, and that Lady Agnes 
was thinking it odd she never had heard of them. 
He said to himself that Biddy was generous. She 
had urged Julia to come, in order that they might 
see how bad the strange young woman would be ; 
but now that she turned out so dazzling she for 
got this calculation and rejoiced in what she in 
nocently supposed to be her triumph. She kept 
away from Julia, however ; she did n t even look 



158  

at her to invite her also to confess that, in vulgar 
parlance, they had been sold. He himself spoke 
to his sister, who was leaning back, in rather a 
detached way, in the corner of a sofa, saying 
something which led her to remark in reply, " Ah, 
I dare say it s extremely fine, but I don t care for 
tragedy when it treads on one s toes. She s like 
a cow who has kicked over the milking-pail. She 
ought to be tied up." 

" My poor Julia, it is n t extremely fine ; it 
is n t fine at all," Sherringham rejoined, with some 
irritation. 

"Excuse me. I thought that was why you in 
vited us." 

"I thought she was different," Sherringham 
said. 

" Ah, if you don t care for her, so much the 
better. It has always seemed to me that you 
make too much of those people." 

" Oh, I Ylo care for her in a way, too. She s 
interesting." His sister gave him a momentary 
mystified glance, and he added, " And she s aw 
ful ! " He felt stupidly annoyed, and he was 
ashamed of his annoyance, for he could have as 
signed no reason for it. It did n t make it less, 
for the moment, to see Gabriel Nash approach 
Mrs. Dallow, introduced by Nick Dormer. He 
gave place to the two young men with a certain 
alacrity, for he had a sense of being put in the 
wrong, in respect to the heroine of the occasion, 
by Nash s very presence. He remembered that 



 159 

it had been a part of their bargain, as it were, 
that he should present that gentleman to his 
sister. He was not sorry to be relieved of the 
office by Nick, and he even, tacitly and ironically, 
wished his cousin s friend joy of a colloquy with 
Mrs. Dallow. Sherringham s life was spent with 
people, he was used to people, and both as a host 
and as a guest he carried them, in general, lightly. 
He could observe, especially in the former capa 
city, without uneasiness, take the temperature 
without anxiety. But at present his company 
oppressed him ; he felt himself nervous, which 
was the thing in the world that he had always 
held to be least an honour to a gentleman dedi 
cated to diplomacy. He was vexed with the lev 
ity in himself which had made him call them to 
gether on so poor a pretext, and yet he was vexed 
with the stupidity in them which made them 
think, as they evidently did, that the pretext was 
sufficient. He inwardly groaned at the precipi 
tancy with which he had saddled himself with the 
Tragic Muse (a tragic muse who was noisy and 
pert), and yet he wished his visitors would go 
away and leave him alone with her. 

Nick Dormer said to Mrs. Dallow that he 
wanted her to know an old friend of his, one of 
the cleverest men he knew ; and he added the 
hope that she would be gentle and encouraging 
with him : he was so timid and so easily discon 
certed. 

Gabriel Nash dropped into a chair by the arm 



160  

of Julia s sofa, Nick Dormer went away, and Mrs. 
Dallow turned her glance upon her new acquaint 
ance without a perceptible change of position. 
Then she emitted, with rapidity, the remark, 
" It s very awkward when people are told one is 
clever." 

" It s awkward if one is n t," said Mr. Nash, 
smiling. 

" Yes, but so few people are enough to be 
talked about." 

" Is n t that just the reason why such a matter, 
such an exception, ought to be mentioned to 
them?" asked Gabriel Nash. "They mightn t 
find it out for themselves. Of course, however, 
as you say, there ought to be a certainty ; then 
they are surer to know it. Dormer s a dear fel 
low, but he s rash and superficial." 

Mrs. Dallow at this turned her glance a second 
time upon her interlocutor ; but during the rest 
of the conversation she rarely repeated the move 
ment. If she liked Nick Dormer extremely (and 
it may without further delay be communicated to 
the reader that she did), her liking was of a kind 
that opposed no difficulty whatever to her not 
liking (in case of such a complication) a person 
attached or otherwise belonging to him. It was 
jnot in her nature to extend tolerances to others 
(for the sake of an individual she loved : the toler- 
/ance was usually consumed in the loving; there 
Jwas nothing left over. If the affection that iso 
lates and simplifies its object may be distin- 



 l6l 

guished from the affection that seeks communica 
tions and contacts for it, Julia Dallow s belonged 
wholly to the former class. She was not so much 
jealous as rigidly direct. She desired no experi 
ence for the familiar and yet partly mysterious 
kinsman in whom she took an interest that she 
would not have desired, for herself ; and, indeed, 
the cause of her interest in him was partly the 
vision of his helping her to the particular emo 
tion that she did desire the emotion of great 
affairs and of public action. To have such ambi 
tions for him appeared to her the greatest honour 
she could do him ; her conscience was in it as 
well as her inclination, and her scheme, in her 
conception, was noble enough to varnish over 
any disdain she might feel for forces drawing him 
/ another way. She had a prejudice, in general, 
\ against his connections, a suspicion of them and 
a supply of unwrought contempt ready for them. 
It was a singular circumstance that she was 
skepthal even when, knowing her as well as he 
did, h-.j thought them worth recommending to 
her : the recommendation, indeed, inveterately 
confirmed the suspicion. 

This was a law from which Gabriel Nash was 
condemned to suffer, if suffering could on any 
occasion be predicated of Gabriel Nash. His 
pretension was, in truth, that he had purged his 
life of such incongruities, though probably he 
would have admitted that if a sore spot remained 
the hand of a woman would be sure to touch it. 






1 62  

In dining with her brother and with the Dormers, 
two evenings before, Mrs. Dallow had been moved 
to exclaim that Peter and Nick knew the most 
extraordinary people. As regards Peter the atti 
tudinizing girl and her mother now pointed that 
moral with sufficient vividness ; so that there was 
little arrogance in taking a similar quality for 
granted in the conceited man at her elbow, who 
sat there as if he would be capable, from one mo 
ment to another, of leaning over the arm of her 
sofa. She had not the slightest wish to talk with 
him about himself, and was afraid, for an instant, 
that he was on the point of passing from the 
chapter of his cleverness to that of his timidity. 
It was a false alarm, however, for instead of this 
he said something about the pleasures of the 
monologue, as the distraction that had just been 
offered was called by the French. He intimated 
that in his opinion these pleasures were mainly 
for the performers. They had all, at any rate, 
given Miss Rooth a charming afternoon ; that, 
of course, was what Mrs. Dallow s kind brother 
had mainly intended in arranging the little party. 
(Mrs. Dallow hated to hear him call her brother 
" kind : " the term seemed offensively patroniz 
ing.) But he himself, he related, was now con 
stantly employed in the same beneficence, listen 
ing, two thirds of his time, to "intonations" and 
shrieks. She had doubtless observed it herself, 
how the great current of the age, the adoration 
of the mime, was almost too strong for any indi- 



 163 

vidual ; how it swept one along and hurled one 
against the rocks. As she made no response to 
this proposition Gabriel Nash asked her if she 
had not been struck with the main sign of the 
time, the preponderance of the mountebank, the 
glory and renown, the personal favor, that he en 
joyed. Hadn t she noticed what an immense 
part of the public attention he held, in London 
at least ? For in Paris society was not so per 
vaded with him, and the women of the profession, 
in particular, were not in every drawing-room. 

" I don t know what you mean," Mrs. Dallow 
said. " I know nothing of any such people." 

"Aren t they under your feet wherever you 
turn their performances, their portraits, their 
speeches, their autobiographies, their names, their 
manners, their ugly mugs, as the people say, and 
their idiotic pretensions ? " 

"I dare say it depends on the places one goes 
to. If they re everywhere " and Mrs. Dallow 
paused a moment "I don t go everywhere." 

" I con t go anywhere, but they mount on my 
back, at home, like the Old Man of the Sea. Just 
observe a little when you return to London," 
Nash continued, with friendly instructiveness. 
Mrs. Dallow got up at this she didn t like re 
ceiving directions ; but no other corner of the 
loom appeared to offer her any particular reason 
for crossing to it : she never did such a thing 
without a great inducement. So she remained 
standing there, as if she were quitting the place 



164  

in a moment, which indeed she now determined 
to do ; and her interlocutor, rising also, lingered 
beside her, unencouraged but unperturbed. He 
went on to remark that Mr. Sherringham was 
quite right to offer Miss Rooth an afternoon s 
sport ; she deserved it as a fine, brave, amiable 
girl. She was highly educated, knew a dozen 
languages, was of illustrious lineage, and was im 
mensely particular. 

" Immensely particular ? " Mrs. Dallow re 
peated. 

" Perhaps I should say that her mother is, on 
her behalf. Particular about the sort of people 
they meet the tone, the standard. I m bound 
to say, they re like you : they don t go every 
where. That spirit is meritorious ; it should be 
recognized and rewarded." 

Mrs. Dallow said nothing for a moment ; she 
looked vaguely round the room, but not at Miriam 
Rooth. Nevertheless she presently dropped, in 
allusion to her, the words, " She s dreadfully 
vulgar." 

" Ah, don t say that to my friend Dormer ! " 
Gabriel Nash exclaimed. 

" Are you and he such great friends ? " Mrs. 
Dallow asked, looking at him. 

" Great enough to make me hope we shall be 
greater." 

Again, for a moment, she said nothing ; then 
she went on 

" Why should n t I say to him that she s vul 
gar?"

" Because he admires her so much ; he wants 
to paint her." 

"To paint her? " 

" To paint her portrait" 

" Oh, I see. I dare say she d do for that." 

Gabriel Nash laughed gayly. " If that s your 
opinion of her, you are not very complimentary 
to the art he aspires to practice." 

" He aspires to practice ? " Mrs. Dallow re 
peated. 

" Have n t you talked with him about it ? Ah, 
you must keep him up to it ! " 

Julia Dallow was conscious, for a moment, of 
looking uncomfortable ; but it relieved her to 
demand of her neighbor, in a certain tone, " Are 
you an artist ? " 

" I try to be," Nash replied, smiling ; " but I 
work in such a difficult material." 

He spoke this with such a clever suggestion 
of unexpected reference that, in spite of herself, 
Mrs. Dallow said after him 

" Difficult material ? " 

" I work in life ! " 

At this Mrs. Dallow turned away, leaving Nash 
the impression that she probably misunderstood 
his speech, thinking he meant that he drew from 
the living model, or some such platitude : as if 
there could have been any likelihood that he 
drew from the dead one. This, indeed, would 
not fully have explained the abruptness with 
which she dropped their conversation. Gabriel

Nash, however, was used to sudden collapses, and 
even to sudden ruptures, on the part of his in- 
terlocutors, and no man had more the secret of 
remaining gracefully with his ideas on his hands. 
He saw Mrs. Dallow approach Nick Dormer, who 
was talking with one of the ladies of the Em 
bassy, and apparently signify to him that she 
wished to speak to him. He got up, they had 
a minute s conversation, and then he turned and 
took leave of his fellow-visitors. Mrs. Dallow 
said a word to her brother, Dormer joined her, 
and then they came together to the door. In 
this movement they had to pass near Nash, and 
it gave her an opportunity to nod good-by to him, 
which he was by no means sure she would have 
done if Nick had not been with her. The young 
man stopped a moment ; he said to Nash : " I 
should like to see you this evening, late; you 
must meet me somewhere." 

"We ll take a walk I should like that," 
Nash replied. " I shall smoke a cigar at the cafe 
on the corner of the Place de 1 Opera; you ll 
find me there." Gabriel prepared to compass his 
own departure, but before doing so he addressed 
himself to the duty of saying a few words of 
civility to Lady Agnes. This proved difficult, 
for on one side she was defended by the wall of 
the room and on the other rendered inaccessible 
by Miriam s mother, who clung to her with a 
quickly-rooted fidelity, showing no symptom of 



, l6/ 

distance. Gabriel compromised on her daughter 
Grace, who said to him : 

"You were talking with my cousin, Mrs. Dai- 
low." 

" To her rather than with her," Nash smiled. 

"Ah, she s very charming," said Grace. 

"She s very beautiful," Nash rejoined. 

" And very clever," Miss Dormer continued. 

"Very, very intelligent." His conversation 
with the young lady went little further than this, 
and he presently took leave of Peter Sherring- 
ham ; remarking to him, as he shook hands, that 
he was very sorry for him. But he had courted 
his fate. 

" What do you mean by my fate ? " Sherring- 
ham asked 

" You ve got them for life." 

" Why for life, when I now lucidly and coura 
geously recognize that she is n t good ? " 

" Ah, but she 11 become so," said Gabriel 
Nash. 

" Do you think that ? " Sherringham inquired, 
with a candor which made his visitors laugh. 

" You will that s more to the purpose ! " 
Gabriel exclaimed, as he went away. 

Ten minutes later Lady Agnes substituted a 
general vague assent for all further particular 
ones, and withdrew from Mrs. Rooth, and from 
the rest of the company, with her daughters. 
Peter had had very little talk with Biddy, but the 



1 68  

girl kept her disappointment out of her pretty 
eyes and said to him : 

" You told us she did n t know how but she 
does ! " There was no suggestion of disappoint 
ment in this. 

Sherringham held her hand a moment. "Ah, 
it s you who know how, dear Biddy ! " he an 
swered ; and he was conscious that if the occa 
sion had been more private he would have law 
fully kissed her. 

Presently three others of his guests departed, 
and Mr. Nash s assurance that he had them for 
life recurred to him as he observed that Mrs. 
Rooth and her daughter quite failed to profit by 
so many examples. The Lovicks remained a 
colleague and his sociable wife and Peter gave 
them a hint that they were not to leave him ab 
solutely alone with the two ladies. Miriam quit 
ted Mrs. Lovick, who had attempted, with no 
great subtlety, to engage her, and came up to 
Sherringham as if she suspected him of a design 
of stealing from the room and had the idea of 
preventing it. 

" I want some more tea : will you give me some 
more ? I feel quite faint You don t seem to 
suspect how that sort of thing takes it out of 
you." 

Sherringham apologized, extravagantly, for not 
having seen that she had the proper quantity of 
refreshment, and took her to the round table, in 
a corner, on which the little collation had been 



 169 

served. He poured out tea for her, and pressed 
bread and butter on her and petits fours, of all 
which she profusely and methodically partook. It 
was late ; the afternoon had faded and a lamp had 
been brought in, the wide shade of which shed a 
fair glow upon the tea-service, the little plates of 
comestibles. The Lovicks sat with Mrs. Rooth at 
the other end of the room, and the girl stood at the 
table, drinking her tea and eating her bread and 
butter. She consumed these articles so freely 
that he wondered if she had been in serious want 
of food if they were so poor as to have to count 
with that sort of privation. This supposition was 
softening, but still not so much so as to make 
him ask her to sit down. She appeared indeed 
to prefer to stand : she looked better so, as if the 
freedom, the conspicuity of being on her feet and 
treading a stage were agreeable to her. While 
Sherrmgham lingered near her, vaguely, with his 
hands in his pockets, not knowing exactly what 
to say and instinctively avoiding, now, the theat 
rical question (there were moments when he was 
plentifully tired of it), she broke out, abruptly : 
" Confess that you think me intolerably bad ! " 
" Intolerably no." 

" Only tolerably ! I think that s worse." 
" Every now and then you do something very 
clever," Sherringham said. 

" How many such things did I do to-day ? " 
" Oh, three or four. I don t know that I 
counted very carefully." 



1 70  

She raised her cup to her lips, looking at him 
over the rim of it a proceeding which gave her 
eyes a strange expression. " It bores you, and 
you think it disagreeable," she said in a moment 
-"a girl always talking about herself." He 
protested that she could never bore him, and she 
went on: "Oh, I don t want compliments I 
want the truth. An actress has to talk about 
herself ; what else can she talk about, poor vain 
thing ? " 

" She can talk sometimes about other ac 
tresses." 

"That comes to the same thing. You won t 
be serious. I m awfully serious." There was 
something that caught his attention in the way 
she said this a longing, half hopeless, half ar 
gumentative, to be believed in. " If one really 
wants to do anything, one must worry it out ; of 
course everything does n t come the first day," 
she pursued. " I can t see everything at once ; 
but I can see a little more step by step as I 
go : can t I ? " 

" That s the way that s the way," said Sher- 
ringham. " If you see the things to do, the art 
of doing them will come, if you hammer away. 
The great point is to see them." 

" Yes ; and you don t think me clever enough 
for that." 

" Why do you say so, when I ve asked you to 
come here, on purpose ? " 



 I /I 

" You ve asked me to come, but I Ve had no 

success." 

" On the contrary ; every one thought you 
wonderful." 

" Oh, they don t know ! " said Miriam Rooth. 
" You ve not said a word to me. I don t mind 
your not having praised me ; that would be too 
banal. But if I m bad and I know I m dread 
ful I wish you would talk to me about it." 
- " It s delightful to talk to you," Sherringham 
said. 

" No, it is n t, but it s kind," she answered, 
looking away from him. 

Her voice had a quality, as she uttered these 
words, which made him exclaim, " Every now and 
then you say something ! " 

She turned her eyes back to him, smiling. " I 
don t want it to come by accident." Then she 
added : " If there s any good to be got from try 
ing, from showing one s self, how can it come un 
less cne hears the simple truth, the truth that 
turns one inside out ? It s all for that to know 
what cne is, if one s a stick ! " 

" You have great courage, you have rare qual 
ities," said Sherringham. She had begun to 
touch him, to seem different : he was glad she 
had not gone. 

For a moment she made no response to this, 
putting down her empty cup and looking vaguely 
over the table, as if to select something more to 



 

eat. Suddenly she raised her head and broke 
out with vehemence, " I will, I will, I will ! " 
"You 11 do what you want, evidently." 
" I will succeed I will be great Of course 
I know too little, I ve seen too little. But I ve 
always liked it ; I ve never liked anything else. 
I used to learn things, and to do scenes, and to 
rant about the room, when I was five years old." 
She went on, communicative, persuasive, familiar, 
egotistical (as was necessary), and slightly com 
mon, or perhaps only natural ; with reminiscences, 
reasons and anecdotes, an unexpected profusion, 
and with an air of comradeship, of freedom of in 
tercourse, which appeared to plead that she was 
capable at least of embracing that side of the pro 
fession she desired to adopt. He perceived that 
if she had seen very little, as she said, she had also 
seen a great deal ; but both her experience and 
her innocence had been accidental and irregular. 
She had seen very little acting the theatre was 
always too expensive. If she could only go often 
- in Paris, for instance, every night for six 
months to see the best, the worst, everything, 
she would make things out, she would observe and 
learn, what to do, what not to do : it would be a 
kind of school. But she could n t, without selling 
the clothes off her back. It was vile and disgust 
ing to be poor ; and if ever she were to know the 
bliss of having a few francs in her pocket, she 
would make up for it that she could promise ! 
She had never been acquainted with any one who 



 1/3 

could tell her anything if it was good or bad, 
or right or wrong except Mrs. Delamere and 
poor Ruggieri. She supposed they had told her 
a great deal, but perhaps they had n t, and she 
was perfectly willing to give it up if it was bad. 
Evidently Madame Carre thought so ; she thought 
it was horrid. Was n t it perfectly divine, the 
way the old woman had said those verses, those 
speeches of Celie ? If she would only let her come 
and listen to her once in a while, like that, it was 
all she would ask. She had got lots of ideas, just 
from that ; she had practiced them over, over and 
over again, the moment she got home. He might 
ask her mother he might ask the people next 
door. If Madame Carre did n t think she could 
work, she might have heard something that would 
show her. But she didn t think her even good 
enough to criticise ; for that was n t criticism, tell 
ing her her head was good. Of course her head 
was good ; she did n t need to travel up to the 
qitartiers excentriqite to find that out. It was her 
mother, the way she talked, who gave that idea, 
that she wanted to be elegant, and moral, and a 
femme an monde, and all that sort of trash. Of 
course that put people off, when they were only 
thinking of the right way. Did n t she know, 
Miriam herself, that that was the only thing to 
think of? But any one would be kind to her 
mother who knew what a dear she was. " She 
does n t know when it s right or wrong, but she s 
a perfect saint," said the girl, obscuring consid- 



174  

erably her vindication. " She does n t mind when 
I say things over by the hour, dinning them into 
her ears while she sits there and reads. She s 
a tremendous reader ; she s awfully up in liter 
ature. She taught me everything herself. I 
mean all that sort of thing. Of course I m not 
so fond of reading ; I go in for the book of life." 
Sherringham wondered whether her mother had 
not, at any rate, taught her that phrase, and 
thought it highly probable. " It would give on 
my nerves, the life I lead her," Miriam contin 
ued ; "but she s really a delicious woman." 

The oddity of this epithet made Sherringham 
laugh, and altogether, in a few minutes, which is 
perhaps a sign that he abused his right to be a 
man of moods, the young lady had produced a 
revolution of curiosity in him, reawakened his 
sympathy. Her mixture, as it spread itself be 
fore one, was a quickening spectacle : she was 
intelligent and clumsy she was underbred and 
fine. Certainly she was very various, and that 
was rare ; not at all, at this moment, the heavy- 
eyed, frightened creature who had pulled her 
self together with such an effort at Madame 
Carre s, nor the elated " phenomenon " who had 
just been declaiming, nor the rather affected 
and contradictious young person with whom he 
had walked home from the Rue de Constanti- 
i nople. Was this succession of phases a sign 
/ that she really possessed the celebrated artistic 
1 temperament, the nature that made people pro- 



 1/5 

,/ yoking and interesting? That Sherringham him- 
/ self was of that shifting complexion is perhaps 
i proved by his odd capacity for being of two 
j different minds at very nearly the same time. 
Miriam was pretty now, with likeable looks and 
charming usual eyes. Yes, there were things he 
could do for her ; he had already forgotten the 
chill of Mr. Nash s irony, of his prophecy. He 
was even scarcely conscious how much, in gen 
eral, he detested hints, insinuations, favours asked 
obliquely and plaintively : that was doubtless also 
because the girl was so pretty and so fraternizing. 
Perhaps, indeed, it was unjust to qualify it as 
roundabout, the manner in which Miss Rooth 
conveyed to him that it was open to him not only 
to pay for lessons for her, but to meet the expense 
of her nightly attendance, with her mother, at 
instructive exhibitions of theatrical art. It was 
a large order, sending the pair to all the plays ; 
but what Sherringham now found himself think 
ing aboi t was not so much its largeness as that 
it would be rather interesting to go with them 
sometimes and point the moral (the technical one), 
showing her the things he liked, the things he 
disapproved. She repeated her declaration that 
she recognized the fallacy of her mother s views 
about " noble " heroines and about the importance 
of- her looking out for such tremendously proper 
people. " One must let her talk, but of course it 
creates a prejudice," she said, with her eyes on 
Mr. and Mrs. Lovick, who had got up, terminat- 



176  

ing their communion with Mrs. Rooth. " It s a 
great muddle, I know, but she can t bear anything 
coarse and quite right, too. I should n t, either, 
if I did n t have to. But I don t care where I go 
if I can act, or who they are if they 11 help me. 
I want to act that s what I want to do ; I 
don t want to meddle in people s affairs. I can 
look out for myself 7 m all right!" the girl 
exclaimed, roundly, frankly, with a ring of hon 
esty which made her crude and pure. " As for 
doing the bad ones, I m not afraid of that." 

"The bad ones?" 

"The bad women, in the plays like Madame 
Carre. I 11 do anything." 

" I think you 11 do best what you are," re 
marked Sherringham, laughing. " You re a 
strange girl." 

"Je crois bien ! Doesn t one have to be, to 
want to go and exhibit one s self to a loathsome 
crowd, on a platform, with trumpets and a big 
drum, for money to parade one s body and 
one s soul ? " 

Sherringham looked at her a moment : her 
face changed constantly ; now there was a little 
flush and a noble delicacy in it. 

"Give it up ; you re too good for it," he said, 
abruptly. 

" Never, never never till I m pelted ! " 

" Then stay on here a bit ; I 11 take you to the 
theatres." 



 1/7 

" Oh, you dear ! " Miriam delightedly ex 
claimed. Mr. and Mrs. Lovick, accompanied by 
Mrs. Rooth, now crossed the room to them, and 
the girl went on, in the same tone : " Mamma, 
dear, he s the best friend we ve ever had ; he s 
a great deal nicer than I thought." 

"So are you, mademoiselle," said Peter Sher- 
ringham. 

"Oh, I trust Mr. Sherringham I trust him 
infinitely," Mrs. Rooth returned, covering him 
with her mild, respectable, wheedling eyes. "The 
kindness of every one has been beyond every 
thing. Mr. and Mrs. Lovick can t say enough. 
They make the most obliging offers ; they want 
you to know their brother." 

"Oh, I say, he s no brother of mine," Mr. 
Lovick protested, good-naturedly. 

"They think he ll be so suggestive, he ll put 
us up to the right things," Mrs. Rooth went on. 

"It s just a little brother of mine such a 
dear, clever boy," Mrs. Lovick explained. 

" Do you know she has got nine ? Upon my 
honor she has!" said her husband. "This one 
is the r,ixth. Fancy if I had to take them 
over ! " 

" Yes, it makes it rather awkward," Mrs. Lov 
ick amiably conceded. " He has gone on the 
stage, poor dear boy ; he acts rather well." 

u He tried for the diplomatic service, fyut he 
did n t precisely dazzle his examiners," Mr. Lov 
ick remarked. 



TRAGIC MUSE. 

" Edmund s very nasty about him. There are 
lots of gentlemen on the stage ; he s not the 
first." 

"It s such a comfort to hear that," said Mrs. 
Rooth. 

" I m much obliged to you. Has he got a 
theatre ? " Miriam asked. 

" My dear young lady, he has n t even got an 
engagement," replied the young man s unsym- 
pathizing brother-in-law. 

" He has n t been at it very long, but I m sure 
he 11 get on. He s immensely in earnest, and 
he s very good-looking. I just said that if he 
should come over to see us you might rather like 
to meet him. He might give you some tips, as 
my husband says." 

" I don t care for his looks, but I should like 
his tips," said Miriam, smiling. 

"And is he coming over to see you ?" asked 
Sherringham, to whom, while this exchange of 
remarks, which he had not lost, was going on, 
Mrs. Rooth had, in lowered accents, addressed 
herself. 

" Not if I can help it, I think ! " Mr. Lovick 
declared, but so jocosely that it was not embar 
rassing. 

"Oh, sir, I m sure you re fond of him," Mrs. 
Rooth remonstrated, as the party passed together 
into the ante-chamber. 

"No, really, I like some of the others four 
or five of them ; but I don t like Arty." 



 



"We ll make it up to him, then; we ll like 
him," Miriam declared, gayly : and her voice rang 
in the staircase (Sherringham went a little way 
with them), with a charm which her host had 
not perceived in her sportive note the day be 
fore. 



IX. 

NICK DORMER found his friend Nash, that 
evening, on the spot he had designated, smoking 
a cigar in the warm, bright night, in front of the 
cafe at the corner of the square before the Opera. 
He sat down with him, but at the end of five min 
utes he uttered a protest against the crush and 
confusion, the publicity and vulgarity of the place, 
the shuffling procession of the crowd, the jostle of 
fellow-customers, the perpetual brush of waiters. 
" Come away. I want to talk to you, and I can t 
talk here," he said to his companion. " I don t 
care where we go. It will be pleasant to walk ; 
we 11 stroll away to the quartiers serieux. Each 
time I come to Paris, at the end of three days, 
I take the boulevard, with its conventional grim 
ace, into greater disfavour. I hate even to cross 
it, and go half a mile round to avoid it." 

The young men took their course together 
down the Rue de la Paix to the Rue de Rivoli, 
which they crossed, passing beside the gilded 
railing of the Tuileries. The beauty of the night 
the only defect of which was that the im 
mense illumination of Paris kept it from being 
quite night enough, made it a sort of bedizened, 
rejuvenated day gave a charm to the quieter 



 l8l 

streets, drew our friends away to the right, to the 
river and the bridges, the older, duskier city. The 
pale ghost of the palace that had died by fire 
hung over them awhile, and, by the passage now 
open at all times across the garden of the Tuil- 
eries, they came out upon the Seine. They kept 
on and on, moving slowly, smoking, talking, paus 
ing, stopping to look, to emphasize, to compare. 
They fell into discussion, into confidence, into 
inquiry, sympathetic or satiric, and into explana 
tion which needed in turn to be explained. The 
balmly night, the time for talk, the amusement of 
Paris, the memory of young confabulations gave 
a quality to the occasion. Nick had already for 
gotten the little brush he had had with Mrs. Dai- 
low, when they quitted Peter s tea-party together, 
and that he had been almost disconcerted by the 
manner in which she characterized the odious 
man he had taken it into his head to present to 
her. Impertinent and fatuous she had called 
him ; nd when Nick began to explain that he 
was really neither of these things, though he 
could imagine his manner might sometimes sug 
gest them, she had declared that she did n t wish 
to argue about him or ever to hear of him again. 
Nick had not counted on her liking Gabriel Nash, 
but he had thought it would n t matter much if 
she should dislike him a little. He had given 
himself the diversion, which he had not dreamed 
would be cruel to any one concerned, of seeing 
what she would make of a type she had never 



1 82  

encountered before. She had made even less 
than he expected, and her implication that he had 
played her a trick had been irritating enough to 
prevent him from reflecting that the fault might 
have been in some degree with Nash. But he 
had recovered from his resentment sufficiently to 
ask this personage, with every possible circum 
stance of implied consideration for the lady, what 
he, on his side, had made of his charming cousin. 

" Upon my word, my dear fellow, I don t regard 
that as a fair question," was the answer. " Be 
sides, if you think Mrs. Dallow charming, what 
on earth need it matter to you what I think ? 
The superiority of one man s opinion over an 
other s is never so great as when the opinion is 
about a woman." 

" It was to help me to find out what I think of 
yourself," said Nick Dormer. 

" Oh, that you 11 never do. I shall bother you 
to the end. The lady with whom you were so 
good as to make me acquainted is a beautiful 
specimen of the English garden-flower, the pro 
duct of high cultivation and much tending ; a tall, 
delicate stem, with the head set upon it in a man 
ner which, as I recall it, is distinctly so much to 
the good in my day. She s the perfect type of 
the object raised, or bred, and everything about 
her is homogeneous, from the angle of her elbow 
to the way she drops that vague, conventional, 
dry little Oh ! which dispenses with all further 
performance. That sort of completeness is al- 



 183 

ways satisfying. But I did n t satisfy her, and 
she didn t understand me. JjlonVthinkJ^y 
usually u_nder stand." 

" She s no worse than I, then." 

"Ah, she didn t try." 

" No, she does n t try. But she probably 
thought you conceited, and she would think so 
still more if she were to hear you talk about her 
trying." 

" Very likely very likely," said Gabriel Nash. 
" I have an idea a good many people think that. 
It appears to me so droll. I suppose it s a result 
of my little system." 

" Your little system ?" 

" Oh, it s nothing wonderful. Only the idea 
of being just the same to every one. People 
have so bemuddled themselves that the last thing 
they can conceive is that one should be simple." 

Lord, do you call yourself simple ? " Nick 
ejaculated. 

"Absolutely; in the sense of having no in 
terest cf my own to push, no nostrum to adver 
tise, no power to conciliate, no axe to grind. I m 
not a savage ah, far from it but I really think 
I m perfectly independent." 

" Oh, that s always provoking ! " laughed Nick. 

" So it would appear, to the great majority of 
one s fellow-mortals ; and I well remember the 
pang with which I originally made that discovery. 
It darkened my spirit, at a time when I had no 
thought of evil. What we like, when we are un- 



1 84  

regenerate, is that a newcomer should give us a 
password, come over to our side, join our little 
camp or religion, get into our little boat, in short, 
whatever it is, and help us to row it. It s natural 
enough ; we are mostly in different tubs and 
cockles, paddling for life. Our opinions, our con 
victions and doctrines and standards, are simply 
the particular thing that will make the boat go 
our boat, naturally, for they may very often be 
just the thing that will sink another. If you 
won t get in, people generally hate you." 

" Your metaphor is very lame," said Nick ; " it s 
the overcrowded boat that goes to the bottom." 

" Oh, I ll give it another leg or two ! Boats 
can be big, in the infinite of space, and a doctrine 
is a raft that floats the better the more passen 
gers it carries. A passenger jumps over from 
time to time, not so much from fear of sinking as 
from a want of interest in the course or the com 
pany. He swims, he plunges, he dives, he dips 
down and visits the fishes and the mermaids and 
the submarine caves ; he goes from craft to craft, 
and splashes about, on his own account, in the 
blue, cool water. The regenerate, as I call them, 
are the passengers who jump over, in search of 
better fun. I turned my somersault long ago." 

" And now, of course, you re at the head of 
the regenerate ; for, in your turn, you all form a 
select school of porpoises." 

" Not a bit, and I know nothing about heads, 
in the sense you mean. I ve grown a tail, if you 



 185 

will ; I m the merman wandering free. It s a 
delightful trade ! " 

Before they had gone many steps further Nick 
Dormer stopped short, and said to his com 
panion : " I say, my dear fellow, do you mind 
mentioning to me whether you are the greatest 
humbug and charlatan on earth, or a genuine 
intelligence, one that has sifted things for it 
self?" 

" I do puzzle you I m so sorry," Nash re 
plied, benignly. " But I m very sincere. And 
I have tried to straighten out things a bit for 
myself." 

" Then why do you give people such a han 
dle ? " 

" Such a handle ? " 

" For thinking you re an for thinking you re 
not wise." 

" I dare say it s my manner ; they re so unused 
to candour." 

" Why don t you try another ? " Nick inquired. 

" One has the manner that one can ; and mine, 
moreover, is a part of my little system." 

"Ah, if you ve got a little system, you re no 
better than any one else," said Nick going on. 

" I don t pretend to be better, for we are all 
miserable sinners ; I only pretend to be bad in a 
pleasanter, brighter way, by what I can see. It s 
the simplest thing in the world ; I just take for 
granted a certain brightness in life, a certain 
frankness. What is essentially kinder than that, 



1 86  

what is more harmless ? But the tradition of 
dreariness, of stodginess, of dull, dense, literal 
prose, has so sealed people s eyes that they have 
ended by thinking the most normal thing in the 
world the most fantastic. Why be dreary, in 
our little day ? No one can tell me why, and al 
most every one calls me names for simply asking 
the question. But I keep on, for I believe one 
can do a little good by it. I want so. much to do 
a little good," Gabriel Nash continued, taking his 
companion s arm. " My persistence is syste 
matic : don t you see what I mean ? I won t be 
dreary no, no, no; and I won t recognize the 
necessity, or even, if there is any way out of it, 
the accident of dreariness in the life that sur 
rounds me. That s enough to make people stare : 
they re so stupid ! " 

" They think you re impertinent," Dormer re 
marked. 

At this his companion stopped him short, with 
an ejaculation of pain, and, turning his eyes, Nick 
saw under the lamps of the quay that he had 
brought a vivid blush into Nash s face. " I don t 
strike you that way ? " Gabriel asked, reproach 
fully. " 

"Oh, me! Wasn t it just admitted that I 
don t in the least make you out ? " 

"That s the last thing! " Nash murmured, as 
if he were thinking the idea over, with an air of 
genuine distress. "But with a. little patience 
we 11 clear it up together, if you care enough 



 l8/ 

about it," he added more cheerfully. He let his 
friend go on again, and he continued : " Heaven 
help us all ! what do people mean by impertinence ? 
There are many, I think, who don t understand 
its nature or its limits ; and upon my word, I have 
literally seen mere quickness of intelligence or of 
perception, the jump of a step or two, a little 
whirr of the wings of talk, mistaken for it. Yes, 
I have encountered men and women who thought 
you were impertinent if you were not so stupid 
as they. The only impertinence is aggression, 
and I indignantly protest that I am never guilty 
of that clumsiness. Ah, for what do they take 
one, with their presumptions ? Even to defend 
myself, sometimes, I have to make believe to my 
self that I care. I always feel as if I did n t suc 
cessfully make others think so. Perhaps they 
see an impertinence in that. But I dare say the 
offense is in the things that I take, as I say, for 
granted ; for if one tries to be pleased, one passes, 
perhaps inevitably, for being pleased above all 
with one s self. That s really not my case, for I 
find my capacity for pleasure deplorably below 
the mark I ve set. That s why, as I have told 
you, I cultivate it, I try to bring it up. And I 
am actuated by positive benevolence ; I have that 
pretension. That s what I mean by being the 
same to every one, by having only one manner. 
If one is conscious and ingenious to that end, 
what s the harm, when one s motives are so 
pure ? By never, never making the concession, 



1 88  

one may end by becoming a perceptible force for 
good." 

"What concession are you talking about?" 
asked Nick Dormer. 

"Why, that we are only here for dreariness. 
It s impossible to grant it sometimes, if you wish 
to withhold it ever." 

" And what do you mean by dreariness ? 
That s modern slang, and it s terribly vague. 
Many good things are dreary virtue and de 
cency and charity, and perseverance and courage 
and honour." 

" Say at once that life is dreary, my dear fel 
low ! " Gabriel Nash exclaimed. 

" That s on the whole my most usual impres 
sion." 

" C est la que je vous attends ! I m precisely 
engaged in trying what can be done in taking it 
the other way. It s my little personal experi 
ment. Life consists of the personal experiments 
of each of us, and the point of an experiment is 
that it shall succeed. What we contribute is our 
treatment of the material, our rendering of the 
text, our style. A sense of the qualities of a 
style is so rare that many persons should doubt 
less be forgiven for not being able to read, or at 
all events to enjoy us ; but is that a reason for 
giving it up for not being, in this other sphere, 
if one possibly can, a Macaulay, a Ruskin, a 
Renan ? Ah, we must write our best ; it s the 
great thing we can do in the world, on the right 



 189 

side. One has one s form, que diable, and a 
mighty good thing that one has. I m not afraid 
of putting all life into mine, without unduly 
squeezing it. I m not afraid of putting in honour 
and courage and charity, without spoiling them : 
on the contrary, I 11 only do them good. People 
may not read you at sight, may not like you, but 
there s a chance they 11 come round ; and the 
only way to court the chance is to keep it up 
always to keep it up. That s what I do, my dear 
fellow, if you don t think I ve perseverance. If 
some one likes it here and there, if you give a 
little impression of solidity, that s your reward ; 
besides, of course, the pleasure for yourself." 

"Don t you think your style is a little af 
fected?" Nick asked, laughing, as they pro 
ceeded. 

"That s always the charge against a personal 
manner ; if you have any at all, people think you 
have too much. Perhaps, perhaps who can 
say ? Of course one is n t perfect ; but that s the 
delightful thing about art, that there is always 
more to learn and more to do ; one can polish 
and polish, and refine and refine. No doubt I m 
rough still, but I m in the right direction : I make 
it my business to take for granted an interest in 
the beautiful." 

" Ah, the beautiful there it stands, over 
there ! " said Nick Dormer. " I am not so sure 
about yours I don t know what I Ve got hold 
of. But Notre Dame is solid ; Notre Dame is 



IQO  

, wise ; on Notre Dame the distracted mind can 
rest. Come over and look at her ! " 

They had come abreast of the low island from 
which the great cathedral, disengaged to-day 
from her old contacts and adhesions, rises high 
and fair, with her front of beauty and her majestic 
mass, darkened at that hour, or at least simplified, 
under the stars, but only more serene and sub 
lime for her happy union, far aloft, with the cool 
distance and the night Our young men, gossip 
ing as profitably as I leave the reader to estimate, 
crossed the wide, short bridge which made them 
face toward the monuments of old Paris the 
Palais de Justice, the Conciergerie, the holy 
chapel of Saint Louis. They came out before 
the church, which looks down on a square where 
the past, once so thick in the very heart of Paris, 
has been made rather a blank, pervaded, however, 
by the everlasting freshness of the great cathe 
dral-face. It greeted Nick Dormer and Gabriel 
Nash with a kindness which the centuries had 
done nothing to dim. The lamplight of the great 
city washed its foundations, but the towers and 
buttresses, the arches, the galleries, the statues, 
the vast rose-window, the large, full composition, 
seemed to grow clearer as they climbed higher, 
as if they had a conscious benevolent answer for 
the upward gaze of men. 

" How it straightens things out and blows 
away one s vapors anything that s done ! " said 
Nick ; while his companion exclaimed, blandly 
and affectionately : 



 1 9! 

"The dear old thing!" 

" The great point is to do something, instead . ; 
of muddling and questioning ; and, by Jove, it 
makes me want to ! " 

" Want to build a cathedral ? " Nash inquired. 

" Yes, just that." 

" It s you who puzzle me, then, my dear fel 
low. You can t build them out of words." 

" What is it the great poets do ? " asked Nick. 

" Their words are ideas their words are 
images, enchanting collocations and unforget 
table signs. But the verbiage of parliamentary 
speeches ! " 

" Well," said Nick, with a candid, reflective 
sigh, " You can rear a great structure of many 
things not only of stones and timbers and 
painted glass." They walked round Notre Dame, 
pausing, criticising, admiring and discussing ; 
mingling the grave with the gay and paradox with 
contemplation. Behind and at the sides, the 
huge dur-ky vessel of the church seemed to dip 
into the Seine, or rise out of it, floating expan 
sively a ship of stone, with its flying buttresses 
thrown forth like an array of mighty oars. Nick 
Dormer lingered near it with joy, with a certain 
soothing content ; as if it had been the temple of 
a faith so dear to him that there was peace and 
security in its precinct. And there was com 
fort, too, and consolation of the same sort, in the 
company, at this moment, of Nash s equal re 
sponse, of his appreciation, exhibited by his own 



1 92  

signs, of the great effect He felt it so freely 
and uttered his impression with such vividness 
that Nick was reminded of the luminosity his 
boyish admiration had found in him of old, the 
natural intelligence of everything of that kind. 
"Everything of that kind" was, in Nick s mind, 
the description of a wide and bright domain. 

They crossed to the further side of the river, 
where the influence of the Gothic monument 
threw a distinction even over the Parisian smart 
nesses the municipal rule and measure, the 
importunate symmetries, the " handsomeness " 
of everything, the extravagance of gaslight, the 
perpetual click on the neat bridges. In front of 
a quiet little cafe on the right bank, Gabriel Nash 
said, "Let s sit down" he was always ready 
to sit down. It was a friendly establishment and 
an unfashionable quarter, far away from the 
Grand Hotel ; there were the usual little tables 
and chairs on the quay, the muslin curtains be 
hind the glazed front, the general sense of saw 
dust and of drippings of watery beer. The place 
was subdued to stillness, but not extinguished, by 
the lateness of the hour ; no vehicles passed, but 
only, now and then, a light Parisian foot. Be 
yond the parapet they could hear the flow of the 
Seine. Nick Dormer said it made him think of 
the old Paris, of the great Revolution, of Madame 
Roland, quoi ! Gabriel Nash said they could 
have watery beer, but were not obliged to drink 
it. They sat a long time ; they talked a great 



 193 

deal, and the more they said the more the unsaid 
came up. Presently Nash found occasion to re 
mark, " I go about my buiness, like any good citi 
zen that s all." 

" And what is your business ? " 

" The spectacle of the world." 

Nick laughed out. " And what do you do with 
that?" 

" What does any one do with spectacles ? I 
look at it." 

" You are full of contradictions and inconsis 
tencies. You described yourself to me half an 
hour ago as an apostle of beauty." 

"Where is the inconsistency? I do it in the 
broad light of day, whatever I do : that s virtu 
ally what I meant. If I look at the spectacle of 
the world I look in preference at what is charm 
ing in it. Sometimes I have to go far to find it 
very likely ; but that s just what I do. I go 
far as far as my means permit me. Last year 
I heard of such a delightful little spot ; a place 
where a wild fig-tree grows in the south wall, the 
outer side, of an old Spanish city. I was told it 
was a deliciously brown corner, with the sun mak 
ing it warm in winter ! As soon as I could I 
went there." 

" And what did you do ? " 

" I lay on the first green grass I liked it." 

" If that sort of thing is all you accomplish, you 
are not encouraging." 

" I accomplish my happiness it seems to me 



194 , 

that s something. I have feelings, I have sensa 
tions : let me tell you that s not so common. It s 
rare to have them ; and if you chance to have 
them it s rare not to be ashamed of them. I go 
after them when I judge they won t hurt any 
one." 

" You re lucky to have money for your travel 
ing-expenses," said Nick. 

" No doubt, no doubt ; but I do it very cheap. 
I take my stand on my nature, on my disposition. 
I m not ashamed of it, I don t think it s so hor 
rible, my disposition. But we ve befogged and 
befouled so the whole question of liberty, of spon 
taneity, of good-humor and inclination and enjoy 
ment, that there s nothing that makes people 
stare so as to see one natural." 

"You are always thinking too much of *peo- 
pie. 

"They say I think too little," Gabriel smiled. 

"Well, I ve agreed to stand for Harsh," said 
Nick, with a roundabout transition. 

" It syou, then, who are lucky to have money." 

"I haven t," Nick replied. " My expenses are 
to be paid." 

" Then you too must think of people. " 

Nick made no answer to this, but after a mo 
ment he said, " I wish very much you had more 
to show for it." 

" To show for what ? " 

" Your little system the aesthetic life." 

Nash hesitated, tolerantly, gayly, as he often 



 195 

did, with an air of being embarrassed to choose 
between several answers, any one of them would 
be so right " Oh, having something to show is 
such a poor business. It s a kind of confession 
of failure." 

" Yes, you re more affected than anything 
else," said Nick impatiently. 

" No, my dear boy, I m more good-natured : 
don t I prove it ? I m rather disappointed to 
find that you are not worthy of the esoteric doc 
trine. But there is, I confess, another plane of 
intelligence, honorable, and very honorable in its 
way, from which it may legitimately appear im 
portant to have something to show. If you must 
confine yourself to that plane, I won t refuse you 
my sympathy. After all, that s what / have to 
show ! But the degree of my sympathy must of 
course depend on the nature of the manifestation 
that you wish to make." 

" You know it very well you ve guessed it," 
Nick rtjoined, looking before him in a conscious 
modest way which, if he had been a few years 
younger, would have been called sheepish. 

" Ah, you ve broken the scent with telling me 
you are going to return to the House of Com 
mons," said Nash. 

" No wonder you don t make it out ! My situ 
ation is certainly absurd enough. What I really 
want to do is to be a painter. That s the abject, 
crude, ridiculous fact. In this out-of-the-way 
corner, at the dead of night, in Ic wered tones, I 



196  

venture to disclose it to you. Is n t that the 
aesthetic life ? " 

" Do you know how to paint ? " asked Nash. 

" Not in the least. No element of burlesque 
is therefore wanting to my position." 

" That makes no difference. I m so glad ! " 

" So glad I don t know how ? " 

" So glad of it all. Yes, that only makes it 
better. You re a delightful case, and I like de 
lightful cases. We must see it through. I re 
joice that I met you." 

" Do you think I can do anything ? " Nick in 
quired. 

" Paint good pictures ? How can I tell, till 
I Ve seen some of your work ? Does n t it come 
back to me that at Oxford you used to sketch 
very prettily ? But that s the last thing that 
matters." 

" What does matter, then ? " Nick demanded, 
turning his eyes on his companion. 

" To be on the right side on the side of 
beauty." 

" There will be precious little beauty if I pro 
duce nothing but daubs." 

" Ah, you cling to the old false measure of suc 
cess. I must cure you of that. There will be 
the beauty of having been disinterested and inde 
pendent ; of having taken the world in the free, 
brave, personal way." 

"I shall nevertheless paint decently if I can," 
Nick declared. 



 197 

"I m almost sorry! It will make your case 
less clear, your example less grand." 

" My example will be grand enough, with the 
fight I shall have to make." 

" The fight with whom ? " 

" With myself, first of all. I m awfully against 
it." 

" Ah, but you 11 have me on the other side," 
smiled Nash. 

" Well, you 11 have more than a handful to 
meet everything, every one that belongs to 
me, that touches me, near or far ; my family, my 
blood, my heredity, my traditions, my promises, 
my circumstances, my prejudices ; my little past, 
such as it is ; my great future, such as it has been 
supposed it may be." 

" I see, I see ; it s admirable ! " Nash ex 
claimed. " And Mrs. Dallow into the bargain," 
he added. 

" Yes, Mrs. Dallow, if you like." 

" Are you in love with her ? " 

" Not in the least." 

"Well, she is with you so I perceived." 

" Don t say that," said Nick Dormer, with sud 
den sternness. 

" Ah, you are, you are ! " his companion re 
joined, judging apparently from this accent. 

" I don t know what I am heaven help me ! " 
Nick broke out, tossing his hat down on his little 
tin table with vehemence. "I m a freak of na 
ture and a sport of the mocking gods ! Why 



198  

should they go out of their way to worry me ? 
Why should they do everything so inconsequent, 
so improbable, so preposterous ? It s the vulgar- 
/ est practical joke. There has never been any- 
1 thing of the sort among us ; we are all Philistines 
{ to the core, with about as much aesthetic sense 
(, as that hat. It s excellent soil I don t com 
plain of it but not a soil to grow that flower. 
From where the devil, then, has the seed been 
dropped ? I look back from generation to gen 
eration ; I scour our annals without finding the 
least little sketching grandmother, any sign of a 
building, or versifying, or collecting, or even tulip- 
raising ancestor. They were all as blind as bats, 
and none the less happy for that I m a wanton 
variation, an unaccountable monster. My dear 
father, rest his soul, went through life without a 
suspicion that there is anything in it that can t 
be boiled into blue-books ; and he became, in 
that conviction, a very distinguished person. He 
brought me up in the same simplicity, and in the 
hope of the same eminence. It would have been 
better if I had remained so. I think it s partly 
your fault that I have n t," Nick went on. " At 
Oxford you were very bad company for me, my 
evil genius ; you opened my eyes, you communi 
cated the poison. Since then, little by little, it 
has been working within me ; vaguely, covertly, 
insensibly at first, but during the last year or 
two with violence, pertinacity, cruelty. I have 
taken every antidote in life ; but it s no use, 



 199 

I m stricken. It tears me to pieces, as I may 
say." 

" I see, I follow you," said Nash, who had lis 
tened to this recital with radiant interest and 
curiosity. " And that s why you are" going to 
stand." 

" Precisely it s an antidote. And, at present 
you re another." 

" Another ? " 

" That s why I jumped at you. A bigger dose 
of you may disagree with me to that extent that 
I shall either die or get better." 

" I shall control the dilution," said Nash. 
" Poor fellow if you re elected ! " he added. 

" Poor fellow, either way. You don t know the 
atmosphere in which I live, the horror, the scan 
dal that my apostasy would inspire, the injury and 
suffering that it would inflict. I believe it would 
kill my mother. She thinks my father is watch 
ing me from the skies." 

"Jolly to make him jump ! " Nash exclaimed. 

" He would jump indeed ; he would come 
straight down on top of me. And then the gro- 
tesqueness of it to begin, all of a sudden, at my 
age." 

" It s perfect, indeed ; it s a magnificent case," 
Nash went on. 

" Think how it sounds a paragraph in the 
London papers : Mr. Nicholas Dormer, M. P. for 
Harsh and son of the late Right Honourable, and 
so forth and so forth, is about to give up his seat 



200  

and withdraw from public life, in order to devote 
himself to the practice of portrait-painting. Or 
ders respectfully solicited. " 

" The nineteenth century is better than I 
thought," said Nash. " It s the portrait that 
preoccupies you ? " 

" I wish you could see ; you must come, imme 
diately, to my place in London." 

" You wretch, you re capable of having tal 
ent ! " cried Nash. 

" No, I m too old, too old. It s too late to go 
through the mill." 

" You make me young ! Don t miss your 
election, at your peril. Think of the edifica 
tion." 

" The edification ? " 

" Of your throwing it all up the next mo 
ment." 

"That would be pleasant for Mr. Carteret," 
Nick observed. 

"Mr. Carteret?" 

" A dear old fellow who will wish to pay my 
agent s bill." 

" Serve him right, for such depraved tastes." 

" You do me good," said Nick, getting up and 
turning away. 

" Don t call me useless, then." 

" Ah, but not in the way you mean. It s only 
if I don t get in that I shall perhaps console my 
self with the brush," Nick continued, as they re 
traced their steps. 



 2OI 

" For the sake of all the Muses, then, don t 
stand. For you will get in." 

"Very likely. At any rate I ve promised." 
" You Ve promised Mrs. Dallow ? " 
" It s her place ; she 11 put me in," Nick said. 
" Baleful woman ! But I 11 pull you out ! " 



X. 

FOR several days Peter Sherringham had busi 
ness in hand which left him neither time nor free 
dom of mind to occupy himself actively with the 
ladies of the Hotel de la Garonne. There were 
moments when they brushed across his memory, 
but their passage was rapid and not lighted up 
with any particular complacency of attention ; for 
he shrank considerably from bringing it to the 
proof the question of whether Miriam would 
be an interest or only a bore. She had left him, 
after their second meeting, with a quickened ex 
pectation, but in the course of a few hours that 
flame had burned dim. Like many other men, 
Sherringham was a mixture of impulse and reflec 
tion ; but he was peculiar in this, that thinking 
things over almost always made him think less 
well of them. He found illusions necessary, so 
that in order to keep an adequate number going 
he often earnestly forbade himself that exercise. 
Mrs. Rooth and her daughter were "there and 
could certainly be trusted to make themselves 
felt. He was conscious of their anxiety, their 
calculations, as of a kind of oppression, and knew 
that, whatever results might ensue, he should 
have to do something positive for them. An idea 



 2O$ 

of tenacity, of worrying feminine duration, asso 
ciated itself with their presence ; he would have 
assented, with a silent nod, to the proposition 
(enunciated by Gabriel Nash) that he was saddled 
with them. Remedies hovered before him, but 
they figured also, at the same time, as complica 
tions ; ranging vaguely from the expenditure of 
money to the discovery that he was in love. This 
latter accident would be particularly tedious ; he 
had a full perception of the arts by which the 
girl s mother might succeed in making it so. It 
would not be a compensation for trouble, but a 
trouble which in itself would require compensa 
tion. Would that balm spring from the spectacle 
of the young lady s genius ? The genius would 
have to be very great to justify a rising young 
diplomatist in making a fool of himself. 

With the excuse of pressing work he put off his 
young pupil from day to day, and from day to 
day he expected to hear her knock at his door. 
It woulc be time enough when they came after 
him ; and he was unable to see how, after all, he 
could serve them even then. He had proposed, 
impetuously, a course of theatres ; but that would 
be a considerable personal effort, now that the 
summer was about to begin, with bad air, stale 
pieces, tired actors. When, however, more than 
a week had elapsed without a reminder of his ne 
glected promise, it came over him that he must 
himself, in honor, give a sign. There was a deli 
cacy in such discretion he was touched by be- 



204 THE TRAGIC 

ing let alone. The flurry of work at the embassy 
was over, and he had time to ask himself what, in 
especial, he should do. He wished to have some 
thing definite to suggest before communicating 
with the Hotel de la Garonne. 

As a consequence of this speculation he went 
back to Madame Carre, to ask her to reconsider 
her unfavorable judgment and give the young 
English lady to oblige him a dozen lessons 
of the sort that she knew how to give. He was 
aware that this request scarcely stood on its feet ; 
for in the first place Madame Carre never recon 
sidered, when once she had got her impression, 
and in the second she never wasted herself on 
subjects whom nature had not formed to do her 
honor. He knew that his asking her to strain a 
point to please him would give her a false idea 
(for that matter, she had it already) of his rela 
tions, actual or prospective, with the girl ; but he 
reflected that he need n t care for that, as Miriam 
herself probably wouldn t care. What he had 
mainly in mind was to say to the old actress that 
she had been mistaken thejeune Anglaise was 
not such a duffer. This would take some cour 
age, but it would also add to the amusement of 
his visit. 

He found her at home, but as soon as he had 
expressed the conviction I have mentioned she 
exclaimed, " Oh, your jeune Anglaise ; I know a 
great deal more about her than you ! She has 
been back to see me twice ; she does n t go the 



 

longest way round. She charges me like a gren 
adier, and she asks me to give her guess a lit 
tle what ! private recitations, all to herself. If 
she does n t succeed, it won t be for want of know 
ing how to thump at doors. The other day, when 
I came in, she was waiting for me ; she had been 
there for an hour. My private recitations have 
you an idea what people pay for them ? " 

" Between artists, you know, there are easier 
conditions," Sherringham laughed. 

" How do I know if she s an artist ? She 
won t open her mouth to me ; what she wants is 
to make me say things to her. She does make 
me I don t know how and she sits there 
gaping at me with her big eyes. They look like 
open pockets ! " 

" I dare say she 11 profit by it," said Sherring 
ham. 

" I dare say you will ! Her face is stupid while 
she watches me, and when she has tired me out 
she simply walks away. However, as she comes 
back Madame Carre paused a moment, lis 
tened, and then exclaimed, " Did n t I tell you ? " 

Sherringham heard a parley of voices in the 
little antechamber, and the next moment the door 
was pushed open and Miriam Rooth bounded into 
the room. She was flushed and breathless, with 
out a smile, very direct. 

" Will you hear me to-day ? I know four 
things," she immediately began. Then, perceiv 
ing Sherringham, she added in the same brisk, 



206  

earnest tone, as if the matter were of the highest 
importance, " Oh, how d ye do ? I m very glad 
you are here." She said nothing else to him 
than this, appealed to him in no way, made no al 
lusion to his having neglected her, but addressed 
herself entirely to Madame Carre, as if he had 
not been there ; making no excuses and using no 
flattery ; taking rather a tone of equal authority, 
as if she considered that the celebrated artist had 
a sacred duty toward her. This was another 
variation, Sherringham thought ; it differed from 
each of the attitudes in which he had previously 
seen her. It came over him suddenly that so far 
from there being any question of her having the 
histrionic nature, she simply had it in such per 
fection that she was always acting ; that her ex 
istence was a series of parts assumed for the mo 
ment, each changed for the next, before the 
perpetual mirror of some curiosity or admiration 
or wonder some spectatorship that she per 
ceived or imagined in the people about her. In 
terested as he had ever been in the profession of 
which she was potentially an ornament, this idea 
startled him by its novelty and even lent, on the 
spot, a formidable, a really appalling character to 
Miriam Rooth. It struck him, abruptly, that a 
woman whose only being was to " make believe," 
to make believe that she had any and every being 
that you liked, that would serve a purpose, pro 
duce a certain effect, and whose identity resided 
in the continuity of her personations, so that she 



 2O/ 

had no moral privacy, as he phrased it to himself, 
but lived in a high wind of exhibition, of figura 
tion such a woman was a kind of monster, in 
whom of necessity there would be nothing to 
like, because there would be nothing to take hold 
of. He felt for a moment that he had been very 
simple not to have achieved before that analysis 
of the actress. The girl s very face made it vivid 
to him now the discovery that she positively 
had no countenance of her own, but only the 
countenance of the occasion, a sequence, a variety 
(capable possibly of becoming immense), of repre 
sentative movements. She was always trying 
them, practicing them, for her amusement or 
profit, jumping from one to the other and extend 
ing her range ; and this would doubtless be her 
occupation more and more as she acquired ease 
and confidence. The expression that came near 
est to belonging to her, as it were, was the one 
that came nearest to being a blank an air of 
inanity when she forgot herself, watching some 
thing. Then her eye was heavy and her mouth 
rather common ; though it was perhaps just at 
such a moment that the fine line of her head told 
most. She had looked slightly bete even when 
Sherringham, on their first meeting at Madame 
Carre s, said to Nick Dormer that she was the 
image of the Tragic Muse. 

Now, at any rate, he had the apprehension that 
she might do what she liked with her face. It 
was an elastic substance, an element of gutta- 



208  

percha, like the flexibility of the gymnast, the 
lady who, at a music-hall, is shot from the mouth 
of a cannon. He colored a little at this quick 
ened view of the actress ; he had always looked 
more poetically, somehow, at that priestess of 
art. But what was she, the priestess, when one 
came to think of it, but a female gymnast, a 
mountebank at higher wages? She didn t lit 
erally hang by her heels from a trapeze, holding 
a fat man in her teeth, but she made the same 
use of her tongue, of her eyes, of the imitative 
trick, that her muscular sister made of leg and 
jaw. It was an odd circumstance that Miriam 
Rooth s face seemed to him to-day a finer instru 
ment than old Madame Carre s. It was doubt 
less that the girl s was fresh and strong, with a 
future in it, while poor Madame Carre s was worn 
and weary, with only a past. 

The old woman said something, half in jest, 
half in real resentment, about the brutality of 
youth, as Miriam went to a mirror and quickly 
took off her hat, patting and arranging her hair, 
as a preliminary to making herself heard. Sher- 
ringham saw, with surprise and amusement, that 
the clever Frenchwoman, who had in her long 
life exhausted every adroitness, was in a manner 
helpless, condemned, both protesting and con 
senting. Miriam had taken but a few days and 
a couple of visits to become a successful force ; 
she had imposed herself, and Madame Carre, 
while she laughed (yet looked terrible too, with 



 2OQ 

artifices of eye and gesture), was reduced to the 
last line of defense that of declaring her coarse 
and clumsy, saying she might knock her down, 
but that proved nothing. She spoke jestingly 
enough not to offend Miriam, but her manner 
betrayed the irritation of an intelligent woman 
who, at an advanced age, found herself for the 
first time failing to understand. What she did n t 
understand was the kind of social product that 
had been presented to her by Gabriel Nash ; and 
this suggested to Sherringham that the jeune 
Anglaise was perhaps indeed rare, a new type, 
as Madame Carre must have seen innumerable 
varieties. He guessed that the girl was perfectly 
prepared to be abused and that her indifference 
to what might be thought of her discretion was a 
proof of life, health, and spirit, the insolence of 
conscious power. 

When she had given herself a touch at the 
glass she turned round, with a rapid " Ecoutez 
mainteiiant ! " and stood leaning a moment, 
slightly lowered and inclined backward, with her 
hands behind her and supporting her, on the 
table in front of the mirror. She waited an in 
stant, turning her eyes from one of her com 
panions to the other, as if she were taking 
possession of them (an eminently conscious, in 
tentional proceeding, which made Sherringham 
ask himself what had become of her former terror 
and whether that and her tears had all been a 
comedy) : after which, abruptly straightening 



210  

herself, she began to repeat a short French poem, 
a composition modern and delicate, one of the 
things she had induced Madame Carre to say 
over to her. She had learned it, practiced it, re 
hearsed it to her mother, and now she had been 
childishly eager to show what she could do with 
it. What she mainly did was to reproduce with 
a crude fidelity, but with extraordinary memory, 
the intonations, the personal quavers and ca 
dences of her model. 

" How bad you make me seem to myself, and 
if I were you how much better I should say it ! " 
was Madame Carre s first criticism. 

Miriam allowed her little time to develop this 
idea, for she broke out, at the shortest intervals, 
with the five other specimens of verse to which 
the old actress had handed her the key. They 
were all delicate lyrics, of tender or pathetic inten 
tion, by contemporary poets all things demand 
ing perfect taste and art, a mastery of tone, of 
insinuation, in the interpreter. Miriam had gob 
bled them up, and she gave them forth in the same 
way as the first, with close, rude, audacious mim 
icry. There was a moment when Sherringham 
was afraid Madame Carre would think she was 
making fun of her manner, her celebrated sim 
pers and grimaces, so extravagant did the girl s 
performance cause these refinements to appear. 

When she had finished, the old woman said, 
" Should you like now to hear how you do it ? " 
and, without waiting for an answer, phrased and 



 211 

trilled the last of the pieces, from beginning to 
end, exactly as Miriam had done, making this 
imitation of an imitation the drollest thing con 
ceivable. If she had been annoyed it was a 
perfect revenge. Miriam had dropped on a sofa, 
exhausted, and she stared at first, looking flushed 
and wild ; then she gave way to merriment, 
laughing with a high sense of comedy. She said 
afterwards, to defend herself, that the verses in 
question, and indeed all those she had recited, 
were of the most difficult sort : you had to do 
them ; they did n t do themselves they were 
things in which the gros moyens were of no avail. 
" Ah, my poor child, your means are all gros 
moyens ; you appear to have no others," Madame 
Carre replied. " You do what you can, but there 
are people like that ; it s the way they are made. 
They can never come nearer to the delicate ; 
shades don t exist for them, they don t see cer 
tain differences. It was to show you a difference 
that I repeated that thing as you repeat it, as 
you represent my doing it. If you are struck 
with the little the two ways have in common, so 
much the better. But you seem to me to coarsen 
everything you touch." 

Sherringham thought this judgment harsh to 
cruelty, and perceived that Miss Rooth had the 
power to set the teeth of her instructress on 
edge. She acted on her nerves ; she was made 
of a thick, rough substance which the old woman 
was not accustomed to manipulate. This exas- 



212 THE TRAGIC ML SR. 

peration, however, was a kind of flattery ; it was 
neither indifference nor simple contempt ; it 
acknowledged a mystifying reality in the girl and 
even a degree of importance. Miriam remarked, 
serenely enough, that the things she wanted most 
to do were just those that were not for the gros 
moyens, the vulgar obvious dodges, the starts 
and shouts, that any one could think of and that 
the gros public liked. She wanted to do what 
was most difficult and to plunge into it from the 
first ; and she explained, as if it were a discov 
ery of her own, that there were two kinds of 
scenes and speeches : those which acted them 
selves, of which the treatment was plain, the only 
way, so that you had just to take it ; and those 
which were open to interpretation, with which 
you had to fight every step, rendering, arranging, 
doing it according to your idea. Some of the 
most effective things, and the most celebrated 
and admired, like the frenzy of Juliet with her 
potion, were of the former sort ; but it was the 
others she liked best. 

Madame Carre" received this revelation good- 
naturedly enough, considering its want of fresh 
ness, and only laughed at the young lady for 
looking so nobly patronizing while she gave it. 
It was clear that her laughter was partly ded 
icated to the good faith with which Miriam de 
scribed herself as preponderantly interested in 
the subtler problems of her art. Sherringham 
was charmed with the girl s pluck if it was 



 213 

pluck and not mere density the brightness 
with which she submitted, for a purpose, to the 
old woman s rough usage. He wanted to take 
her away, to give her a friendly caution, to advise 
her not to become a bore, not to expose herself. 
But she held up her beautiful head in a way that 
showed she did n t care at present how she ex 
posed herself, and that (it was half coarseness 
Madame Carre was so far right -and half for 
titude) she had no intention of coming away so 
long as there was anything to be picked up. She 
sat, and still she sat, challenging her hostess with 
every sort of question some reasonable, some 
ingenious, some strangely futile and some highly 
indiscreet ; but all with the effect that, contrary 
to Sherringham s expectation, Madame Carre 
warmed to the work of answering and explaining, 
became interested, was content to keep her and 
to talk. Yet she took her ease; she relieved 
herself, with the rare cynicism of the artist, all 
the crudity, the irony and intensity of a discus 
sion of esoteric things, of personal mysteries, of 
methods and secrets. It was the oddest hour 
Sherringham had ever spent, even in the course 
of investigation which had often led him into the 
cuisine, as the French called it, the distillery or 
back-shop, of the admired profession. He got 
up several times to come away ; then he re 
mained, partly in order not to leave Miriam alone 
with her terrible initiatress, partly because he 
was both amused and edified, and partly because 



214  

Madame Carre held him by the appeal of her 
sharp, confidential old eyes, addressing her talk 
to him, with Miriam as a subject, a vile illustra 
tion. She undressed this young lady, as it were, 
from head to foot, turned her inside out, weighed 
and measured and sounded her : it was all, for 
Sherringham, a new revelation of the point to 
which, in her profession and nation, a ferocious 
analysis had been carried, with an intelligence of 
the business and a special vocabulary. What 
struck him, above all, was the way she knew her 
reasons and everything was sharp and clear in 
/ her mind and lay under her hand. If she had 
rare perceptions she had traced them to their 
source ; she could give an account of what she 
did ; she knew perfectly why ; she could explain 
it, defend it, amplify it, fight for it : and all this 
was an intellectual joy to her, allowing her a 
chance to abound and insist and be clever. There 
was a kind of cruelty, or at least of hardness in 
it all, to Sherringham s English sense, that sense 
which can never really reconcile itself to the 
question of execution and has extraneous senti 
ments to placate with compromises and super 
ficialities, frivolities that have often a pleasant 
moral fragrance. In theory there was nothing 
that he valued more than just such a logical pas 
sion as Madame Carre s ; but in fact, when he 
found himself in close quarters with it, it was apt 
to seem to him an ado about nothing. 

If the old woman was hard it was not thr.t 



 215 

many of her present conclusions, as regards Mir 
iam, were not indulgent, but that she had a vis 
ion of the great manner, of right and wrong, of 
the just and the false, so high and religious that 
the individual was nothing before it a prompt 
and easy sacrifice. It made Sherringham uncom 
fortable, as he had been made uncomfortable by 
certain feuilletons, reviews of the theatres in the 
Paris newspapers, which he was committed to 
thinking important, but of which, when they were 
very good, he was rather ashamed. When they 
were very good, that is when they were very thor 
ough, they were very personal, as was inevitable 
in dealing with the most personal of the arts : 
they went into details ; they put the dots on the 
z s ; they discussed, impartially, the qualities of 
appearance, the physical gifts of the actor or 
actress, finding them in some cases reprehensibly 
inadequate. Sherringham could not rid himself of 
a prejudice against these pronouncements; in the 
case of ;he actresses especially they appeared to 
him brutal and indelicate unmanly as coming 
from a critic sitting smoking in his chair. At the 
same time he was aware of the dilemma (he hated 
it ; it made him blush still more) in which his 
objection lodged him. x^ one was right in liking 
the actor s art, one ought to have been interested 
in every candid criticism of it, which, given the 
peculiar conditions, would be legitimate in pro 
portion as it should be minute. If the criticism 
that recognized frankly these conditions seemed 



2l6  

an inferior or an offensive thing, then what was 
to be said for the art itself ? What an implica 
tion, if the criticism was tolerable only so long as 
it was worthless so long as it remained vague 
and timid ! This was a knot which Sherringham 
had never straightened out : he contented him 
self with saying that there was no reason a theat 
rical critic should n t be a gentleman, at the same 
time that he often remarked that it was an odious 
trade, which no gentleman could possibly follow. 
The best of the fraternity, so conspicuous in 
Paris, were those who did n t follow it those 
who, while pretending to write about the stage, 
wrote about everything else. 

It was as if Madame Carre, in pursuance of her 
inflamed sense that the art was everything and 
the individual nothing, save as he happened to 
serve it, had said, " Well, if she will have it she 
shall ; she shall know what she is in for, what I 
went through, battered and broken in as we all 
have been all who are worthy, who have had 
the honor. She shall know the real point of 
view." It was as if she were still haunted with 
Mrs. Rooth s nonsense, her hypocrisy, her scru 
ples something she felt a need to belabor, to 
trample on. Miriam took it all as a bath, a bap 
tism, with passive exhilaration and gleeful shiv 
ers ; staring, wondering, sometimes blushing and 
failing to follow, but not shrinking nor wounded ; 
laughing, when it was necessary, at her own ex 
pense and feeling evidently that this at last was 



 21? 

the air of the profession, an initiation which noth 
ing could undo. Sherringham said to her that 
he would see her home that he wanted to talk 
to her and she must walk away with him. " And 
it s understood, then, she may come back," he 
added to Madame Carre. " It s my affair, of 
course. You ll take an interest in her for a 
month or two ; she will sit at your feet." 

" Oh, I 11 knock her about ; she seems stout 
enough ! " said the old actress. 



XI. 

WHEN she had descended into the street with 
Sherringham, Miriam informed him that she was 
thirsty, dying to drink something : upon which 
he asked her if she would have any objection to 
going with him to a cafe. 

" Objection ? I have spent my life in cafes ! " 
she exclaimed. " They are warm in winter, and 
they are full of gaslight. Mamma and I have sat 
in them for hours, many a time, with a consom- 
mation of three sous, to save fire and candles at 
home. We have lived in places we could n t sit 
in, if you want to know where there was only 
really room if we were in bed. Mamma s money 
is sent out from England, and sometimes it did n t 
come. Once it didn t come for months for 
months and months. I don t know how we lived. 
There was n t any to come ; there was n t any 
to get home. That is n t amusing when you re 
away, in a foreign town, without any friends. 
Mamma used to borrow, but people would n t al 
ways lend. You need n t be afraid she won t 
borrow from you. We are rather better now. 
Something has been done in England ; I don t 
understand what. It s only fivepence a year, but 
it has been settled ; it comes regularly ; it used to 



TRAGIC MUSE. 219 

come only when we had written and begged and 
waited. But it made no difference ; mamma was 
always up to her ears in books. They served her 
for food and drink. When she had nothing to 
eat she began a novel in ten volumes the old- 
fashioned ones ; they lasted longest. She knows 
every cabinet de lecture in every town ; the little 
cheap, shabby ones, I mean, in the back streets, 
where they have odd volumes and only ask a 
sou, and the books are so old that they smell bad. 
She takes them to the cafes the little cheap, 
shabby cafes, too and she reads there all the 
evening. That s very well for her, but it does n t 
feed me. I don t like a diet of dirty old novels. 
I sit there beside her, with nothing to do, not 
even a stocking to mend ; she does n t think 
that s comme il faut. I don t know what the 
people take me for. However, we have never 
been spoken to : any one can see mamma s a 
lady. As for me, I dare say I might be any 
thing. If you re going to be an actress you must 
get used to being looked at. There were people 
in England who used to ask us to stay ; some of 
them wore our cousins or mamma says they 
were. I have never been very clear about our 
cousins, and I don t think they were at all clear 
about us. Some of them are dead ; the others 
don t ask us any more. You should hear mamma 
on the subject of our visits in England. It s 
very convenient when your cousins are dead, 
because that explains everything. Mamma has 



220 THE TKAGIC MUSE. 

delightful phrases : My family is almost extinct. 
Then your family may have been anything you 
like. Ours, of course, was magnificent. We did 
stay in a place once where there was a deer-park, 
and also private theatricals. I played in them ; 
I was only fifteen years old, but I was very big 
and I thought I was in heaven. I will go any 
where you like ; you need n t be afraid, we have 
been in places ! I have learned a great deal that 
way ; sitting beside mamma and watching people, 
their faces, their types, their movements. There s 
a great deal goes on in cafes : people come to 
them to talk things over, their private affairs, 
their complications ; they have important meet 
ings. Oh, I ve observed scenes, between men 
and women very quiet, terribly quiet, but 
tragic ! Once I saw a woman do something that 
I m going to do some day, when I m great if 
I can get the situation. I 11 tell you what it is 
some day ; I 11 do it for you. Oh, it is the book 
of life ! " 

So Miriam discoursed, familiarly, disconnect 
edly, as the pair went their way down the Rue 
de Constantinople ; and she continued to abound 
in anecdote and remark after they were seated, 
face to face, at a little marble table in an estab 
lishment which Sherringham selected carefully 
and he had caused her, at her request, to be ac 
commodated with strop d orgeat. " I know what 
it will come to : Madame Carre will want to keep 
me." This was one of the announcements she 
presently made. 



 221 

"To keep you?" 

" For the French stage. She won t want to 
let you have me." She said things of that kind, 
astounding in self-complacency, the assumption 
of quick success. She was in earnest, evidently 
prepared to work, but her imagination flew over 
preliminaries and probations, took no account of 
the steps in the process, especially the first tire 
some ones, the test of patience. Sherringham 
had done nothing for her as yet, given no sub 
stantial pledge of interest ; yet she was already 
talking as if his protection were assured and 
jealous. Certainly, however, she seemed to be 
long to him very much indeed, as she sat facing 
him in the Paris cafe, in her youth, her beauty 
and her talkative confidence. This degree of 
possession was highly agreeable to him, and he 
asked nothing more than to make it last and go 
further. The impulse to draw her out was irre 
sistible, to encourage her to show herself to the 
end ; for if he was really destined to take her 
career in hand he counted on some pleasant 
equivalent such, for instance, as that she 
should at least amuse him. 

" It s very singular ; I know nothing like it," 
he said " your equal mastery of two lan 
guages." 

" Say of half a dozen," Miriam smiled. 

" Oh, I don t believe in the others, to the same 
degree. I don t imagine that, with all deference 
to your undeniable facility, you would be judged 



222  

fit to address a German or an Italian audience 
in their own tongue. But you might a French, 
perfectly, and they are the most particular of all ; 
for their idiom is supersensitive, and they are 
incapable of enduring the baragouinage of for 
eigners, to which we listen with such compla 
cency. In fact, your French is better than your 
English it s more conventional ; there are little 
queernesses and impurities in your English, as if 
you had lived abroad too much. Ah, you must 
work that." 

" I 11 work it with you. I like the way you 
speak." 

" You must speak beautifully ; you must do 
something for the standard." 

" For the standard ? " 

" There is n t any, after all ; it has gone to the 
dogs." 

" Oh, I 11 bring it back. I know what you 
mean." 

" No one knows, no one cares ; the sense is 
gone it isn t in the public," Sherringham con 
tinued, ventilating a grievance he was rarely able 
to forget, the vision of which now suddenly made 
a mission, full of sanctity, for Miriam Rooth. 
" Purity of speech, on our stage, does n t exist. 
Every one speaks as he likes, and audiences 
never notice ; it s the last thing they think of. 
The place is given up to abominable dialects and 
individual tricks, any vulgarity flourishes, and on 
top of it all the Americans, with every conceiv- 



 22$ 

able crudity, come in to make confusion worse 
confounded. And when one laments it people 
stare ; they don t know what one means." 

" Do you mean the grand manner, certain pom 
pous pronunciations, the style of the Kembles ? " 

" I mean any style that is a style, that is a sys 
tem, an art, that contributes a positive beauty to 
utterance. When I pay ten shillings to hear you 
speak, I want you to know how, que diable ! Say 
that to people and they are mostly lost in stupor ; 
only a few, the very intelligent ones, exclaim : 
Then do you want actors to be affected ? : 

" And do you ? " asked Miriam, full of interest. 

" My poor child, what else, under the sun, 
should they be ? Is n t their whole art the affec 
tation par excellence ? The public won t stand 
that to-day, so one hears it said. If that be true, 
it simply means that the theatre, as I care for it, 
that is as a personal art, is at an end." 

" Never, never, never ! " the girl cried, in a 
voice that made a dozen people look round. 

" I sometimes think it that the personal art 
is at an end, and that henceforth we shall have 
only the arts capable, no doubt, of immense 
development in their way (indeed they have al 
ready reached it) of the stage-carpenter and 
the costumer. In London the drama is already 
smothered in scenery ; the interpretation scram 
bles off as it can. To get the old personal im 
pression, which used to be everything, you 
must go to the poor countries, and most of all 
to Italy." 



224  

" Oh, I ve had it ; it s very personal ! " said 
Miriam, knowingly. 

" You ve seen the nudity of the stage, the poor 
painted, tattered screen behind, and in the empty 
space the histrionic figure, doing everything it 
knows how, in complete possession. The per 
sonality isn t our English personality, and it may 
not always carry us with it ; but the direction is 
right, and it has the superiority that it s a human 
exhibition, not a mechanical one." 

"I can act just like an Italian," said Miriam, 
eagerly. 

" I would rather you acted like an English 
woman, if an Englishwoman would only act." 

" Oh, I 11 show you ! " 

" But you re not English," said Sherringham, 
sociably, with his arms on the table. 

" I beg your pardon ; you should hear mamma 
about our race. 

" You re a Jewess I m sure of that," Sher 
ringham went on. 

She jumped at this, as he was destined to see, 
later, that she would jump at anything that would 
make her more interesting or striking ; even at 
things which, grotesquely, contradicted or ex 
cluded each other. " That s always possible, if 
one s clever. I m very willing, because I want 
to be the English Rachel." 

" Then you must leave Madame Carre, as soon 
as you have got from her what she can give. N 

" Oh, you need n t fear ; you sha n t lose me," 



 22$ 

the girl replied, with gross, charming fatuity. 
" My name is Jewish," she went on, "but it was 
that of my grandmother, my father s mother. She 
was a baroness, in Germany. That is, she was 
the daughter of a baron." 

Sherringham accepted this statement with res 
ervations, but he replied, " Put all that together, 
and it makes you very sufficiently of Rachel s 
tribe." 

" I don t care, if I m of her tribe artistically. 
I m of the family of the artists ; je me fiche of 
any other ! I m in the same style as that wo 
man ; I know it." 

"You speak as if you had seen her," said Sher 
ringham, amused at the way she talked of " that 
woman." 

" Oh, I know all about her ; I know all about 
all the great actors. But that won t prevent me 
from speaking divine English." 

" You must learn lots of verse ; you must re 
peat it to me," Sherringham went on. " You 
must break yourself in till you can say anything. 
You must learn passages of Milton, passages of 
Wordsworth." 

" Did they write plays ? " 

" Oh, it is n t only a matter of plays ! You 
can t speak a part properly till you can speak 
everything else, anything that comes up, espe 
cially in proportion as it s difficult. That gives 
you authority." 

" Oh, yes, I m going in for authority. There s 



226  

more chance in English," the girl added, in the 
next breath. " There are not so many others 
the terrible competition. There are so many here 
not that I m afraid," she chattered on. "But 
we ve got America, and they have n t. America s 
a great place." 

" You talk like a theatrical agent. They re 
lucky not to have it as we have it. Some of 
them do go, and it ruins them." 

" Why, it fills their pockets ! " Miriam cried. 

" Yes, but see what they pay. It s the death 
of an actor to play to big populations that don t 
understand his language. It s nothing then but 
the gros moyens ; all his delicacy perishes. How 
ever, they ll understand j/w." 

" Perhaps I shall be too affected," said Miriam. 

" You won t be more so than Garrick, or Mrs. 
Siddons, or John Kemble, or Edmund Kean. 
"They understood Edmund Kean. All reflection 
is affectation, and all acting is reflection." 

"I don t know; mine is instinct," Miriam re 
plied. 

" My dear young lady, you talk of yours ; but 
don t be offended if I tell you that yours does n t 
exist. Some day it will, if it comes off. Madame 
Carre s does, because she has reflected. The 
talent, the desire, the energy are an instinct ; 
but by the time these things become a perform 
ance they are an instinct put in its place." 

" Madame Carre is very philosophic. I shall 
never be like her." 



 22? 

" Of course you won t ; you 11 be original. But 
you 11 have your own ideas." 

" I dare say I shall have a good many of 
yours," said Miriam, smiling across the table. 

They sat a moment, looking at each other. 

"Don t go in for coquetry; it s a waste of 
time." 

" Well, that s civil ! " the girl cried. 

" Oh, I don t mean for me ; I mean for your 
self. I want you to be so concentrated. I am 
bound to give you good advice. You don t strike 
me as flirtatious and that sort of thing, and that s 
in your favor." 

" In my favor ? " 

"It does save time." 

" Perhaps it saves too much. Don t you think 
the artist ought to have passions ? " 

Sherringham hesitated a moment ; he thought 
an examination of this question premature. 
" Flirtations are not passions," he replied. " No, 
you are simple at least I suspect you are ; for 
of course, with a woman, one would be clever to 
know." 

She asked why he pronounced her simple, but 
he judged it best, and more consonant with fair 
play, to defer even a treatment of this branch of 
the question ; so that, to change the subject, he 
said: "Be sure you don t betray me to your friend 
Mr. Nash." 

" Betray you ? Do you mean about your rec 
ommending affectation ? " 



228  

" Dear me, no ; he recommends it himself. 
That is, he practices it, and on a scale ! " 

"But he makes one hate it." 

" He proves what I mean," said Sherringham : 
"that the great comedian is the one who raises 
it to a science. If we paid ten shillings to listen 
to Mr. Nash we should think him very fine. But 
we want to know what it s supposed to be." 

" It s too odious, the way he talks about us ! " 
Miriam cried, assentingly. 

" About us ?" 

" Us poor actors." 

" It s the competition he dislikes," said Sher 
ringham, laughing. 

" However, he s very good-natured ; he lent 
mamma thirty pounds," the girl added, honestly. 
Sherringham, at this information, was not able to 
repress a certain small twinge which his compan 
ion perceived and of which she appeared to mis 
take the meaning. "Of course he 11 get it back," 
she went on, while Sherringham looked at her in 
silence for a minute. Fortune had not supplied 
him profusely with money, but his emotion was 
not caused by the apprehension that he too would 
probably have to put his hand in his pocket for 
Mrs. Rooth. It was simply the instinctive recoil 
of a fastidious nature from the idea of familiar 
intimacy with people who lived from hand to 
mouth, and a sense that that intimacy would have 
to be defined if it was to go much further. He 
would wish to know what it was supposed to be, 



 2 29 

like Gabriel Nash s histrionics. After a moment 
Miriam mistook his thought still more completely, 
and in doing so gave him a flash of fore-knowl 
edge of the way it was in her to strike from time 
to time a note exasperatingly, almost consciously 
vulgar, which one would hate for the reason, 
among others, that by that time one would be in 
love with her. " Well, then, he won t if you 
don t believe it ! " she exclaimed, with a laugh. 
He was saying to himself that the only possible 
form was that they should borrow only from him. 
" You re a funny man. I make you blush," Mir 
iam persisted. 

" I must reply with the tu quoque, though I 
have not that effect on you." 

" I don t understand," said the girl. 

"You re an extraordinary young lady." 

" You mean I m horrid. Well, I dare say I 
am. But I m better when you know me." 

Sherringham made no direct rejoinder to this, 
but after a moment he said, " Your mother must 
repay that money. I 11 give it to her." 

" You had better give it to him ! " cried Mir 
iam. " If once we have it " She interrupted 
herself, and with another and a softer tone, one 
of her professional transitions, she remarked, " I 
suppose you have never known any one that s 
poor." 

" I m poor myself. That is, I m very far from 
rich. But why receive favors ? " And here he 
in turn checked himself, with the sense that he

was indeed taking a great deal on his back if he 
pretended already (he had not seen the pair three 
times) to regulate their intercourse with the rest 
of the world. But Miriam instantly carried out 
his thought and more than his thought. 

" Favors from Mr. Nash ? Oh, he does n t 
count ! " 

The way she dropped these words (they would 
have been admirable on the stage) made him 
laugh and say immediately : "What I meant just 
now was that you are not to tell him, after all my 
swagger, that I consider that you and I are really 
required to save our theatre." 

" Oh, if we can save it, he shall know it ! " 
Then Miriam added that she must positively get 
home ; her mother would be in a state : she had 
really scarcely ever been out alone. He might n t 
think it, but so it was. Her mother s ideas, those 
awfully proper ones, were not all talk. She did 
keep her ! Sherringham accepted this he had 
an adequate, and indeed an analytic vision of Mrs. 
Rooth s conservatism ; but he observed at the 
same time that his companion made no motion to 
rise. He made none, either ; he only said 

"We are very frivolous, the way we chatter. 
What you want to do, to get your foot in the 
stirrup, is supremely difficult. There is every 
thing to overcome. You have neither an engage 
ment nor the prospect of an engagement." 

"Oh, you ll get me one!" Miriam s manner 
expressed that this was so certain that it was not 



 23 I 

worth dilating upon ; so, instead of dilating, she 
inquired abruptly, a second time, " Why do you 
think I m so simple ? " 

" I don t, then. Did n t I tell you just now that 
you were extraordinary ? That s the term, more 
over, that you applied to yourself, when you came 
to see me when you said a girl had to be, to 
wish to go on the stage. It remains the right one, 
and your simplicity does n t mitigate it. What s 
rare in you is that you have as I suspect, at 
least no nature of your own." Miriam listened 
to this as if she were preparing to argue with it 
or not, only as it should strike her as being a 
pleasing picture ; but as yet, naturally, she failed 
to understand. " You are always playing some 
thing ; there are no intervals. It s the absence 
of intervals, of a/&lt;?;^/or background, that I don t 
( comprehend. Youjre _an embroidery without a 
canvas," 

" Yes, perhaps," the girl replied, with her head 
on one side, as if she were looking at the pattern. m 
" But I m very honest." 

" You can t be everything, a consummate ac 
tress and a flower of the field. You ve got to 
choose." 

She looked at him a moment. " I m glad you 
think I m so wonderful." 

"Your feigning may be honest, in the sense 
that your only feeling is your feigned one," Sher- 
ringham went on. " That s what I mean by the 
absence of a ground or of intervals. It s a kind 
of thing that s a labyrinth ! " 



232  

" I know what I am," said Miriam, senten- 
tiously. 

But her companion continued, following his 
own irain : " Were you really so frightened, the 
first day you went to Madame Carre s ? " 

She stared a moment, and then, with a flush, 
throwing back her head, "Do you think I was 
pretending? " 

" I think you always are. However, your van 
ity (if you had any !) would be natural." 

" I have plenty of that I m not ashamed to 
own it." 

" You would be capable of pretending that you 
have. But excuse the audacity and the crudity 
of my speculations it only proves my interest. 
What is it that you know you are ? " 

" Why, an artist. Is n t that a canvas ? " 

" Yes, an intellectual one, but not a moral." 

" Oh yes, it is, too. And I m a good girl : 
won t that do ? " 

" It remains to be seen," Sherringham laughed. 
" A creature who is all an artist I am curious 
to see that." 

" Surely it has been seen, in lots of painters, 
lots of musicians." 

" Yes, but those arts are not personal, like 
yours. I mean not so much so. There s some 
thing left for what shall I call it ? for char 
acter." 

Miriam stared again, with her tragic light. 
" And do you think I ve got no character ? " As 



 233 

he hesitated she pushed back her chair, rising 
rapidly. 

He looked up at her an instant she seemed 
so " plastic ; " and then, rising too, he answered : 
" Delightful being, you ve got a hundred ! " 



XII. 

THE summer arrived and the dense air of the 
Paris theatres became in fact a still more compli 
cated mixture ; yet the occasions were not few on 
which Peter Sherringham, having placed a box, 
near the stage (most often a stuffy, dusky baig 
noire), at the disposal of Mrs. Rooth and her 
daughter, found time to look in, as he said, to 
spend a part of the evening with them and point 
the moral of the performance. The pieces, the 
successes of the winter, had entered the automatic 
phase : they went on by the force of the impetus 
acquired, deriving little fresh life from the inter 
pretation, and in ordinary conditions their strong 
points, as rendered by the actors, would have 
been as wearisome to Sherringham as an impor 
tunate repetition of a good story. But it was 
not long before he became aware that the condi 
tions could not be regarded as ordinary. There 
was a new infusion in his consciousness an ele 
ment in his life which altered the relations of 
things. He was not easy till he had found the 
right name for it a name the more satisfactory 
that it was simple, comprehensive, and plausible. 
A new " distraction," in the French sense, was 
what he flattered himself he had discovered ; he 



 

could recognize that as freely as possible without 
being obliged to classify the agreeable resource 
as a new entanglement. He was neither too 
much nor too little diverted ; he had all his usual 
attention to give to his work : he had only an em 
ployment for his odd hours, which, without being 
imperative, had, over various others, the advan 
tage of a certain continuity. 

And yet, I hasten to add, he was not so well 
pleased with it but that, among his friends, he 
maintained for the present a considerable reserve 
in regard to it. He had no irresistible impulse to 
tell people that he had disinterred a strange, 
handsome girl whom he was bringing up for the 
theatre. She had been seen by several of his 
associates, at his rooms ; but she was not soon to 
be seen there again. Sherringham s reserve 
might by the ill-natured have been termed dissim 
ulation, inasmuch as when asked by the ladies of 
the Embassy what had become of the young per 
son who amused them, that day, so cleverly, he 
gave it out that her whereabouts was uncertain 
and her destiny probably obscure ; he let it be 
suppose:!, in a word, that his benevolence had 
scarcely survived an accidental, charitable occa 
sion. As he went about his customary business, 
and perhaps even put a little more conscience 
into the transaction of it, there was nothing to 
suggest to his companions that he was engaged 
in a private speculation of a singular kind. It 
was perhaps his weakness that he carried the ap- 



236  

prehension of ridicule too far ; but his excuse may 
be said to be that he held it unpardonable for a 
man publicly enrolled in the service of his coun 
try to be ridiculous. It was of course not out of 
all order that such functionaries, their private 
situation permitting, should enjoy a personal ac 
quaintance with stars of the dramatic, the lyric, 
or even the choregraphic stage : high diplomatists 
had indeed not rarely, and not invisibly, culti 
vated this privilege without its proving the sepul 
chre of their reputation. That a gentleman who 
was not a fool should consent a little to become 
one for the sake of a celebrated actress or singer 
cela stiait vu, though it was not perhaps to be 
recommended. It was not a tendency that was 
encouraged at headquarters, where even the most 
rising young men were not encouraged to believe 
they could never fall. Still, it might pass, if it 
were kept in its place ; and there were ancient 
worthies yet in the profession (not those, how 
ever, whom the tradition had helped to go fur 
thest) who held that something of the sort was 
a graceful ornament of the diplomatic character. 
Sherringham was aware he was very " rising " ; 
but Miriam Rooth was not yet a celebrated ac 
tress. She was only a youthful artist, in con 
scientious process of formation, encumbered with 
a mother still more conscientious than herself. 
She was a young English lady, very earnest 
about artistic, about remunerative problems. He 
had accepted the position of a formative influ- 



 237 

ence ; and that was precisely what might provoke 
derision. He was a ministering angel his pa- 
! tience and good-nature really entitled him to the 
^ epithet, and his rewards would doubtless some 
; clay define themselves ; but meanwhile other pro- 
( motions were in contingent prospect, for the 
failure of which these would not, even in their 
abundance, be a compensation. He kept an un 
embarrassed eye upon Downing Street ; and while 
it may frankly be said for him that he was neither 
a pedant nor a prig, he remembered that the last 
impression he ought to wish to produce there 
was that of volatility. 

He felt not particularly volatile, however, when 
he sat behind Miriam at the play and looked over 
her shoulder at the stage ; her observation being 
so keen and her comments so unexpected in their 
vivacity that his curiosity was refreshed and his 
attention stretched beyond its wont. If the spec 
tacle before the footlights had now lost much of 
its annual brilliancy, the fashion in which Miriam 
followed it came near being spectacle enough. 
Moreover, in most cases the attendance of the 
little party was at the Theatre Frangais ; and it 
has been sufficiently indicated that Sherringham, 
though the child of a skeptical age and the votary 
of a cynical science, was still candid enough to 
take the serious, the religious view of that estab 
lishment the view of M. Sarcey and of the un- 
regenerate provincial mind. " In the trade that 
I follow we see things too much in the hard light 



238  

of reason, of calculation," he once remarked to 
his young protegee ; " but it s good for the mind 
to keep up a superstition or two ; it leaves a mar 
gin, like having a second horse to your brougham, 
for night-work. The arts, the amusements, the 
aesthetic part of life, are night-work, if I may say 
so without suggesting the nefarious. At any 
rate, you want your second horse your supersti 
tion that stays at home when the sun is high to 
go your rounds with. The Theatre Frangais is 
my second horse." 

Miriam s appetite for this pleasure showed him 
vividly enough how rarely, in the past, it had 
been within her reach ; and she pleased him, at 
first, by liking everything, seeing almost no dif 
ferences and talking her deep draught undiluted. 
She leaned on the edge of the box with bright 
voracity ; tasting to the core, yet relishing the 
surface, watching each movement of each actor, 
attending to the way each thing was said or done 
as if it were the most important thing, and emit 
ting from time to time applausive or restrictive 
sounds. It was a very pretty exhibition of en 
thusiasm, if enthusiasm be ever critical. Sher- 
ringham had his wonder about it, as it was a part 
of the attraction exerted by this young lady that 
she caused him to have his wonder about every 
thing she did. Was it in fact an exhibition, a 
line taken fcr effect, so that, at the comedy, her 
own comedy was the most successful of all ? That 
question danced attendance on the liberal inter- 



 239 

course of these young people, and fortunately, as 
yet, did little to embitter Sherringham s share of 
it. His general sense that she was personating 
had its especial moments of suspense and per 
plexity, and added variety and even occasionally 
a degree of excitement to their conversation. At 
the theatre, for the most part, she was really 
flushed with eagerness ; and with the spectators 
who turned an admiring eye into the dim com 
partment of which she pervaded the front, she 
might -have passed for a romantic, or at any rate 
an insatiable young woman from the country. 

Mrs. Rooth took a more placid view, but at 
tended immensely to the story, in respect to 
which she manifested a patient good faith which 
had its surprises and its comicalities for Sher- 
ringham. She found no play too tedious, no en- 
tr acte too long, no baignoire too hot, no tissue 
of incidents too complicated, no situation too un 
natural and no sentiments too sublime. She gave 
Sherringham the measure of her power to sit and 
sit an accomplishment to which she owed, in 
the struggle for existence, such superiority as 
she might be said to have achieved. She could 
outsit every one, everything else ; looking as if 
she had acquired the practice in repeated years 
of small frugality combined with large leisure 
periods when she had nothing but time to spend 
and had learned to calculate, in any situation, 
how long she could stay. " Staying " was so 
often a saving a saving of candles, of fire, and 



240  

even (for it sometimes implied a vision of light 
refreshment) of food. Sherringham perceived 
soon enough that she was complete, in her way, 
and if he had been addicted to studying the 
human mixture in its different combinations he 
would have found in her an interesting compen 
dium of some of the infatuations that survive a 
hard discipline. He made, indeed, without diffi 
culty, the reflection that her life might have 
taught her the reality of things, at the same time 
that he could scarcely help thinking it clever of 
her to have so persistently declined the lesson. 
She appeared to have put it by with a deprecat 
ing, ladylike smile a plea of being too soft and 
bland for experience. 

She took the refined, sentimental, tender view 
of the universe, beginning with her own history 
and feelings. She believed in everything high 
and pure, disinterested and orthodox, and even at 
the Hotel de la Garonne was unconscious of the 
shabby or the ugly side of the world. She never 
despaired : otherwise what would have been the 
use df being a Neville-Nugent ? Only not to 
have been one that would have been discour 
aging. She delighted in novels, poems, perver 
sions, misrepresentations, and evasions, and had 
a capacity for smooth, superfluous falsification 
which made Sherringham think her sometimes 
an amusing and sometimes a tedious inventor. 
But she was not dangerous, even if you believed 
her ; she was not even a warning if you did n t. 



 2^1 

It was harsh to call her a hypocrite, because you 
never could have resolved her back into her char 
acter : there was no reverse to her blazonry. She 
built in the air, and was not less amiable than 
she pretended : only that was a pretension too. 
She moved altogether in a world of genteel fable 
Jaad fancy, and Sherringham had to live in it with 
i her, for Miriam s sake, in sociable, vulgar assent, 
f in spite of his feeling that it was rather a low 
L neighborhood. He was at a loss how to take 
what she said she talked, sweetly and discur 
sively, of so many things until he simply per 
ceived that he could only take it, always, for 
untrue. When Miriam laughed at her he was 
rather disagreeably affected : " dear mamma s 
fine stories " was a sufficiently cynical reference 
to the immemorial infirmity of a parent. But 
when the girl backed her up, as he phrased it to 
himself, he liked that even less. 

Mrs. Rooth was very fond of a moral, and had 
never lost her taste for edification. She delighted 
in a beautiful character, and was gratified to find 
so many represented in the contemporary French 
drama. She never failed to direct Miriam s at 
tention to them and to remind her that there is 
nothing in life so precious as the ideal. Sherring 
ham noted the difference between the mother and 
the daughter and thought it singularly marked 
the way that one took everything for the sense, 
or behaved as if she did, caring above all for the 
subject and the romance, the triumph or defeat of 



242  

virtue and the moral comfort of it all, and that 
the other was especially hungry for the manner 
and the art of it, the presentation and the vivid 
ness. Mrs. Rooth abounded in impressive evoca 
tions, and yet he saw no link between her facile 
genius and that of which Miriam gave symptoms. 
The poor lady never could have been accused of 
successful deceit, whereas success in this line 
was exactly what her clever child went in for. 
She made even the true seem fictive, while Mir 
iam s effort was to make the fictive true. Sher- 
ringham thought it an odd, unpromising stock 
(that of the Neville- Nugents) for a dramatic 
talent to have sprung from, till he reflected that 
the evolution was after all natural : the figurative 
impulse in the mother had become conscious, and 
therefore higher, through finding an aim, which 
was beauty, in the daughter. Likely enough the 
Hebraic Mr. Rooth, with his love of old pots and 
Christian altar-cloths, had supplied, in the girl s 
composition, the aesthetic element, the sense of 
form. In their visits to the theatre there was 
nothing that Mrs. Rooth more insisted upon than 
the unprofitableness of deceit, as shown by the 
most distinguished authors the folly and deg 
radation, the corrosive effect upon the spirit, of 
tortuous ways. Sherringham very soon gave up 
the futile task of piecing together her incon 
gruous references to her early life and her family 
in England. He renounced even the doctrine 
that there was a residuum of truth in her claim 



 243 

of great relationships, for, existent or not, he 
cared equally little for her ramifications. The 
principle of this indifference was at bottom a 
certain desire to disconnect Miriam ; for it was 
disagreeable not to be independent in dealing 
with her, and he could be fully so only if she 
were. 

The early weeks of that summer (they went on, 
indeed, into August) were destined to establish 
themselves in his memory as a season of pleasant 
things. The ambassador went away, and Sher- 
ringham had to wait for his own holiday, which 
he did, during the hot days, contentedly enough, 
in spacious halls, with a dim, bird-haunted garden. 
The official world and most other worlds with 
drew from Paris, and the Place de la Concorde, 
a larger, whiter desert than ever, became by a 
reversal of custom, explorable with safety. The 
Champs Elysees were dusty and rural, with little 
creaking booths and exhibitions which made a 
noise like grasshoppers ; the Arc de Triomphe 
threw its cool, sharp shadow for a mile ; the 
Palais de ITndustrie glittered in the light of the 
long days ; the cabmen, in their red waistcoats, 
dozed in their boxes ; and Sherringham permit 
ted himself a " pot "hat and rarely met a friend. 
Thus was Miriam still more disconnected, and 
thus was it possible to deal with her still more 
independently. The theatres on the boulevard 
closed, for the most part, but the great temple of 
the Rue de Richelieu, with an aesthetic responsi- 



244  

bility, continued imperturbably to dispense ex 
amples of style. Madame Carre was going to 
Vichy, but she had not yet taken flight, which 
was a great advantage for Miriam, who could now 
solicit her attention with the consciousness that 
she had no engagements en ville. 

" I make her listen to me I make her tell 
me," said the ardent girl, who was always climb 
ing the slope of the Rue de Constantinople, on 
the shady side, where in the July mornings there 
was a smell of violets from the moist flower-stands 
of fat, white-capped bouquetilrts t in the angles of 
doorways. Miriam liked the Paris of the sum 
mer mornings, the clever freshness of all the 
little trades and the open-air life, the cries, the 
talk from door to door, which reminded her of 
the south, where, in the multiplicity of her habi 
tations, she had lived ; and most of all, the great 
amusement, or nearly, of her walk, the enviable 
baskets of the laundress, piled up with frilled and 
fluted whiteness the certain luxury, she felt as 
she passed, with quick prevision, of her own 
dawn of glory. The greatest amusement perhaps 
was to recognize the pretty sentiment of earli- 
ness, the particular congruity with the hour, in 
the studied, selected dress of the little tripping 
women who were taking the day, for important 
advantages, while it was tender. At any rate 
she always brought with her, from her passage 
through the town, good humor enough (with the 
penny bunch of violets that she stuck in the front 



 245 

of her dress) for whatever awaited her at Madame 
Carre s. She told Sherringham that her dear 
mistress was terribly severe, giving her the most 
difficult, the most exhausting exercises show 
ing a kind of rage for breaking her in. 

" So much the better," Sherringham answered ; 
but he asked no questions, and was glad to let 
the preceptress and the pupil fight it out together. 
He wanted, for the moment, to know as little as 
possible about them : he had been overdosed with 
knowledge, that second day he saw them together. 
He would send Madame Carre her money (she was 
really most obliging), and in the meantime he was 
conscious that Miriam could take care of herself. 
Sometimes he remarked to her that she needn t 
always talk "shop" to him: there were times 
when he was very tired of shop of hers. More 
over, he frankly admitted that he was tired of his 
own, so that the restriction was not brutal. When 
she replied, staring, " Why, I thought you con 
sidered it as such a beautiful, interesting art ! " 
he had no rejoinder more philosophic than " Well, 
I do ; but there are moments when I m sick of it, 
all the same." At other times he said to her : 
" Oh, yes, the results, the finished thing, the dish 
perfectly seasoned and served : not the mess of 
preparation at least not always not the ex 
periments that spoil the material." 

"i thought you thought just these questions 
of study, of the artistic education, as you have 
have called it to me, so fascinating," the girl per 
sisted. Sometimes she was very lucid. 



246  

" Well, after all I m not an actor myself," 
Sherringham answered laughing. 

" You might be one if you were serious," said 
Miriam. To this her friend replied that Mr. Ga 
briel Nash ought to hear that ; which made her 
exclaim, with a certain grimness, that she would 
settle him and his theories some day. Not to 
seem too inconsistent for it was cruel to be 
wilder her when he had taken her up to enlighten 
Sherringham repeated over that for a man like 
himself the interest of the whole thing depended 
on its being considered in a large, liberal way, 
with an intelligence that lifted it out of the ques 
tion of the little tricks of the trade, gave it beauty 
and elevation. Miriam let him know that Madame 
Carre held that there were no little tricks ; that 
everything had its importance as a means to a 
great end ; and that if you were not willing to try 
to approfondir the reason why, in a given situation, 
you should scratch your nose with your left hand 
rather than with your right, you were not worthy 
to tread any stage that respected itself. 

" That s very well ; but if I must go into de 
tails read me a little Shelley," said the young man, 
in the spirit of a high raffine*. 

" You are worse than Madame Carre ; you 
don t know what to invent ; between you you 11 
kill me ! " the girl declared. " I think there s a 
secret league between you to spoil my voice, or 
at least to weaken my wind, before I get it. But 
a la guerre comme a la guerre ! How can I read 
Shelley, however, when I don t understand him ? " 



 247 

"That s just what I want to make you do. 
It s a part of your general training. You may 
do without that, of course without culture and 
taste and perception ; but in that case you 11 be 
nothing but a vulgar cabotine, and nothing will 
be of any consequence." Sherringham had a 
theory that the great lyric poets (he induced her 
to read, and recite as well, long passages of 
Wordsworth and of Swinburne) would teach her 
many of the secrets of competent utterance, the 
mysteries of rhythm, the communicableness of 
style, the latent music of the language and the 
art of " composing " copious speeches and of 
keeping her wind in hand. He held, in perfect 
sincerity, that there was an indirect enlighten 
ment which would be of the highest importance 
to her, and to which it was precisely, by good 

1 fortune, in his power to contribute. She would 
do better in proportion as she had more knowl 
edge even knowledge that might appear to 
have but a remote connection with her business. 
The actor s talent was essentially a gift, a thing 
by itself, implanted, instinctive, accidental, equally 
unconnected with intellect and with virtue - 
Sherringham was completely of that opinion ; but 
it seemed to him no contradiction to consider at 
the same time that intellect (leaving virtue, for 
the moment, out of the question) might be brought 
into fruitful relation with it. It would be a larger 
thing if a better mind were projected upon it - 
without sacrificing the mind. So he lent Miriam 



248  

books which she never read (she was on almost 
irreconcilable terms with the printed page), and 
in the long summer days, when he had leisure, 
took her to the Louvre to admire the great 
works of painting and sculpture. Here, as on 
all occasions, he was struck with the queer jumble 
of her taste, her mixture of intelligence and puer 
ility. He saw that she never read what he gave 
her, though she sometimes would have liked him 
to suppose so ; but in the presence of famous 
pictures and statues she had remarkable flashes 
of perception. She felt these things, she liked 
them, though it was always because she had an 
idea she could use them. The idea was often 
fantastic, but it showed what an eye she had to 
her business. " I could look just like that, if I 
tried." " That s the dress I mean to wear when 
I do Portia." Such were the observations that 
were apt to drop from her under the suggestion 
of antique marbles or when she stood before a 
Titian or a Bronzino. 

When she uttered them, and many others be 
sides, the effect was sometimes irritating to Sher- 
ringham, who had to reflect a little to remember 
that she was no more egotistical than the histri 
onic conscience demanded. He wondered if there 
were necessarily something vulgar in the histri 
onic conscience something condemned only to 
feel the tricky personal question. Was n t it 
better to be perfectly stupid than to have only 
one eye open and wear forever, in the great face 



 249 

of the world, the expression of a knowing wink ? 
At the theatre, on the numerous July evenings 
when the Comedie Franchise played the repertory, 
with exponents determined the more sparse and 
provincial audience should have a revelation of 
the tradition, her appreciation was tremendously 
technical and showed it was not for nothing she 
was now in and out of Madame Carre s innermost 
counsels. But there were moments when even 
her very acuteness seemed to him to drag the 
matter down, to see it in a small and superficial 
sense. What he flattered himself that he was 
trying to do for her (and through her for the stage 
of his time, since she was the instrument, and in- 
contestably a fine one, that had come to his hand) 
was precisely to lift it up, make it rare, keep it in 
the region of distinction and breadth. However, 
she was doubtless right and he was wrong, he 
eventually reasoned : you could afford to be vague 
. only if you had n t a responsibility. He had fine 
\ ideas, but she was to do the acting, that is the 
I application of them, and not he ; and application 
) was always of necessity a sort of vulgarization, 
a smaller thing than theory. If some day she 
should exhibit the great art that it was not purely 
fanciful to forecast for her, the subject would 
doubtless be sufficiently lifted up, and it would n t 
matter that some of the onward steps should have 
been lame. 

This was clear to him on several occasions 
when she repeated or acted something for him 



250  

better than usual ; then she quite carried him 
away, making him wish to ask no more questions, 
but only let her disembroil herself in her own 
own fashion. In these hours she gave him, fit 
fully but forcibly, that impression of beauty 
which was to be her justification. It was too 
soon for any general estimate of her progress ; 
Madame Carre had at last given her an intelligent 
understanding, as well as a sore personal sense, 
of how bad she was. She had therefore begun 
on a new basis ; she had returned to the alphabet 
and the drill. It was a phase of awkwardness, 
like the splashing of a young swimmer, but buoy 
ancy would certainly come out of it. For the 
present there was, for the most part, no great 
alteration of the fact that when she did things 
according to her own idea they were not as yet, 
and seriously judged, worth the devil, as Madame 
Carre said ; and when she did them according to 
that of her instructress they were too apt to be a 
gross parody of that lady s intention. None the 
less she gave glimpses, and her glimpses made 
him feel not only that she was not a fool (that 
was a small relief) but that he was not. 

He made her stick to her English and read 
Shakespeare aloud to him. Mrs. Rooth had rec 
ognized the importance of an apartment in which 
they should be able to receive so beneficent a 
visitor, and was now mistress of a small salon 
with a balcony and a rickety flower-stand (to say 
nothing of a view of many roofs and chimneys), a 



 2$ I 

crooked, waxed floor, an empire clock, an armoire 
a glace (highly convenient for Miriam s postur- 
ings), and several cupboard doors, covered over, 
allowing for treacherous gaps, with the faded 
magenta paper of the wall. The thing had been 
easily done, for Sherringham had said, " Oh, we 
must have a sitting-room, for our studies, you 
know. I ll settle it with the landlady." Mrs. 
Rooth had liked his "we" (indeed, she liked 
everything about him), and he saw in this way 
that she had no insuperable objection to being 
under a pecuniary obligation so long as it was dis 
tinctly understood to be temporary. That he 
should have his money back with interest as soon 
as Miriam was launched was a comfort so deeply 
implied that it only added to intimacy. The win 
dow, stood open on the little balcony, and when 
the sun had left it Sherringham and Miriam could 
linger there, leaning on the rail and talking, 
above the great hum of Paris, with nothing but 
the neighboring tiles and tall tubes to take ac 
count of. Mrs. Rooth, in limp garments, much 
ungirdled, was on the sofa with a novel, making 
good her frequent assertion that she could put 
up with any life that would yield her these two 
articles. There were romantic works that Sher 
ringham had never read, and as to which he had 
vaguely wondered to what class they were ad 
dressed the earlier productions of M. Eugene 
Sue, the once-fashionable compositions of Ma 
dame Sophie Gay with which Mrs. Rooth was 



2$2  

familiar and which she was ready to peruse once 
more if she could get nothing fresher. She had 
always a greasy volume tucked under her while 
her nose was bent upon the pages in hand. She 
scarcely looked up even when Miriam lifted her 
voice to show Sherringham what she could do. 
These tragic or pathetic notes all went out of the 
window and mingled with the undecipherable con 
cert of Paris, so that no neighbor was disturbed 
by them. The girl shrieked and wailed when the 
occasion required it, and Mrs. Rooth only turned 
her page, showing in this way a great aesthetic as 
well as a great personal trust. 

She rather annoyed Sherringham by the seren 
ity of her confidence (for a reason that he fully 
understood only later), save when Miriam caught 
an effect or a tone so well that she made him, in 
the pleasure of it, forget her parent was there. 
He continued to object to the girl s English, with 
the foreign patches which might pass in prose 
but were offensive in the recitation of verse, and 
he wanted to know why she could not speak like 
her mother. He had to do Mrs. Rooth the jus 
tice of recognizing the charm of her voice and 
accent, which gave a certain richness even to the 
foolish things she said. They were of an excel 
lent insular tradition, full both of natural and of 
cultivated sweetness, and they puzzled him when 
other indications seemed to betray her to rele 
gate her to the class of the simply dreary. They 
were like the reverberation of far-off drawing- 
rooms.

The connection between the development of 
Miriam s genius and the necessity of an occa 
sional excursion to the country the charming 
country that lies in so many directions, beyond 
the Parisian banlieue would not have been im 
mediately apparent to a merely superficial ob 
server ; but a day, and then another, at Versailles, 
a day at Fontainebleau and a trip, particularly 
harmonious and happy, to Rambouillet, took 
their place in Sherringham s programme as apart 
of the legitimate indirect culture, an agency in 
the formation of taste. Intimations of the grand 
style, for instance, would proceed in abundance 
from the symmetrical palace and gardens of 
Louis XIV. Sherringham was very fond of Ver 
sailles, and went there more than once with the 
ladies of the Hotel de la Garonne. They chose 
quiet hours, when the fountains were dry ; and 
Mrs. Rooth took an armful of novels and sat on 
a bench in the park, flanked by clipped hedges 
and old statues, while her young companions 
strolled away, walked to the Trianon, explored 
the long, straight vistas of the woods. Ram 
bouillet was vague and pleasant and idle ; they 
had an idea that they found suggestive associa 
tions there ; and indeed there was an old white 
chateau which contained nothing else. They 
found, at any rate, luncheon, and in the land 
scape, a charming sense of summer and of little 
brushed French pictures. 

I have said that in these days Sherringham 



254  

wondered a good deal, and by the time his leave 
of absence was granted him this practice had en 
gendered a particular speculation. He was sur 
prised that he was not in love with Miriam Rooth, 
and he considered, in moments of leisure, the 
causes of his exemption. He had perceived from 
the first that she was a " nature," and each time 
she met his eyes the more vividly it appeared to 
him that her beauty was rare. You had to get 
the view of her face, but when you did so it was 
a splendid mobile mask. And the possessor of 
this high advantage had frankness and courage 
and variety and the unusual and the unexpected. 
She had qualities that seldom went together 
impulses and shynesses, audacities and lapses, 
something coarse, popular, and strong, all inter 
mingled with disdains and languors and nerves. 
And then, above all, she was there, she was ac 
cessible, she almost belonged to him. He re 
flected ingeniously that he owed his escape to a 
peculiar cause the fact that they had together 

/a positive outside object. Objective, as it were, 
was all their communion ; not personal and self- 

j ish, but a matter of art and business and dis 
cussion. Discussion had saved him, and would 
save him further ; for they would always have 
something to quarrel about. Sherringham, who 
was not a diplomatist for nothing ; who had his 
reasons for steering straight and wished neither 
to deprive the British public of a rising star nor 
to exchange his actual situation for that of a 



 255 

conjugal impresario, blessed the beneficence, the 
salubrity, the pure exorcism of art. At the same 
time, rather inconsistently, and feeling that he 
had a completer vision than before of the odd 
animal, the artist who happened to have been 
born a woman, he- felt himself warned against a 
serious connection (he made a great point of the 
"serious") with so slippery and ticklish a crea 
ture. The two ladies had only to stay in Paris, 
save their candle-ends and, as Madame Carre 
had enjoined, practice their scales : there were 
apparently no autumn visits to English country- 
houses in prospect for Mrs. Rooth. 

Sherringham parted with them on the under 
standing that, in London, he would look as 
thoroughly as possible into the question of an 
engagement for Miriam. The day before he be 
gan his holiday he went to see Madame Carre" 
who said to him, " Vous devriez bien nous la 
laisser." 

" She has got something, then ? " 

" She has got most things. She 11 go far. It 
is the first time I ever was mistaken. But don t 
tell her so I don t flatter her ; she 11 be too 
puffed up." 

" Is she very conceited ? " Sherringham asked. 

"Mauvais sujet ! " said Madame Carre. 

It was on the journey to London that he in 
dulged in some of those questionings of his state 
which I have mentioned ; but I must add that by 
the time he reached Charing Cross (he smoked a 



256  

cigar, deferred till after the Channel, in a com- 
partment by himself) it suddenly came over him 
that they were futile. Now that he had left the 
girl, a subversive, unpremeditated heartbeat told 
him it made him hold his breath a minute in 
the carriage that he had after all not escaped. 
He was in love with her : he had been in love 
with her from the first hour. 



XIII. 

THE drive from Harsh to the Place, as it was 
called thereabouts, could be achieved by swift 
horses in less than ten minutes ; and if Mrs. 
Dallow s ponies were capital trotters the general 
high pitch of the occasion made it congruous 
that they should show their speed. The occasion 
was the polling-day, the hour after the battle. 
The ponies had worked, with all the rest, for the 
week before, passing and repassing the neat win 
dows of the flat little town (Mrs. Dallow had the 
complacent belief that there was none in the 
kingdom in which the flower-stands looked more 
respectable between the stiff muslin curtains), 
with their mistress behind them in her low, smart 
trap. Very often she was accompanied by the 
Liberal candidate, but even when she was not 
the equipage seemed scarcely less to represent 
his pleasant, sociable confidence. It moved in a 
radiance of ribbons and handbills and hand-shakes 
and smiies ; of quickened intercourse and sudden 
intimacy ; of sympathy which assumed without 
presuming and gratitude which promised without 
soliciting. But under Julia s guidance the ponies 
pattered now, with no indication of a loss of 
freshness, along the firm, wide avenue which 



258  

wound and curved, to make up in picturesque 
effect for not undulating, from the gates opening 
straight into the town to the Palladian mansion, 
high, square, gray and clean, which stood, among 
parterres and fountains, in the centre of the park, 
generous steed had been sacrificed to bring 
the&gt;gpod news from^Ghent to Aix, but no such 

l_necessary for commu- 
with Lady Agnes.- 
She had remained at the house, not going to 
the Wheatsheafpthe Liberal inn, with {he others ; 
preferring to await in privacy, and indeed in soli 
tude, the momentous result oTTTTe poll. She had 
come down to Harsh with the two girls in the 
course of the proceedings. Julia had not thought 
they would do much good, but she was expansive 
and indulgent now, and she had liberally asked 
them. Lady Agnes had not a nice canvassing 
manner, effective as she might have been in the 
character of the high, benignant, affable mother 
looking sweet participation, but not interfer 
ing of the young and handsome, the shining, 
convincing, wonderfully clever and certainly ir 
resistible aspirant. Grace Dormer had zeal with 
out art, and Lady Agnes, who, during her hus 
band s lifetime, had seen their affairs follow the 
satisfactory principle of a tendency to defer to 
supreme merit, had never really learned the les 
son that voting goes by favor. However, she 
could pray God if she could n t flatter the cheese 
monger, and Nick felt that she had stayed at 



 2 59 

home to pray for him. I must add that Julia 
Dallow was too happy now, flicking her whip in 
the bright summer air, to say anything so ungra 
cious even to herself as that her companion had 
been returned in spite of his nearest female rela 
tives. Besides, Biddy had been a rosy help : she 
had looked persuasively pretty, in white and blue, 
on platforms and in recurrent carriages, out of 
which she had tossed, blushing and making peo 
ple remember her eyes, several words that were 
telling for their very simplicity. 

Mrs. Dallow was really too glad for any defi 
nite reflection, even for personal exultation, the 
vanity of recognizing her own large share of the 
work. Nick was in, and he was beside her, tired, 
silent, vague, beflowered and beribboned, and he 
had been splendid from beginning to end, delight 
fully good-humored and at the same time delight 
fully clever still cleverer than she had supposed 
he could be. The sense that she had helped his 
cleverness and that she had been repaid by it, or 
by his gratitude (it came to the same thing), in 
a way she appreciated, was not triumphant and 
jealous : it was lost, for the present, in the gen 
eral cheerful break of the long tension. So 
nothing passed between them on their way to 
the house ; there was no sound in the park but 
the pleasant rustle of summer (it seemed an ap 
plausive murmur) and the swift progress of the 
vehicle. 

Lady Agnes already knew, for as soon as the 



260  

result was declared Nick had dispatched a man 
on horseback to her, carrying the figures on a 
scrawled card. He had been far from getting 
away at once, having to respond to the hubbub 
of acclamation, to speak yet again, to thank his 
electors individually and collectively, to chaff the 
Tories, to be carried hither and yon, and above 
all to pretend that the interest of the business 
was now greater for him than ever. If he said 
never a word after he put himself in Julia s hands 
to go home, perhaps it was partly because the 
consciousness began to glimmer within him that 
that interest had on the contrary now suddenly 
diminished. He wanted to see his mother, be 
cause he knew she wanted to see him, to fold him 
close in her arms. They had been open there 
for that purpose for the last half hour, and her 
expectancy, now no longer an ache of suspense, 
was the reason of Julia s round pace. Yet this 
very expectancy somehow made Nick wince a 
little. Meeting his mother was like being elected 
over again. 

The others had not come back yet, and Lady 
Agnes was alone in the large bright drawing- 
room. When Nick went in with Mrs. Dallow he 
saw her at the further end ; she had evidently 
been walking to and fro, the whole length of it, 
and her tall, upright black figure seemed in pos 
session of the fair vastness, like an exclamation- 
point at the bottom of a blank page. The room, 
rich and simple, was a place of perfection as well 



 26 1 

as of splendor in delicate tints, with precious 
specimens of French furniture of the last cen 
tury ranged against walls of pale brocade, and 
here and there a small, almost priceless picture. 
George Dallovv had made it, caring for these 
things and liking to talk about them (scarcely 
about anything else) ; so that it appeared to rep 
resent him still, what was best in his kindly, 
limited nature a friendly, competent, tiresome 
insistence upon purity and homogeneity. Nick 
Dormer could hear him yet, and could see him, 
too fat and with a congenital thickness in his 
speech, lounging there in loose clothes, with his 
eternal cigarette. " Now, my dear fellow, that s 
what I call form : I don t know what you call it " 
that was the way he used to begin. The room 
was full of flowers in rare vases, but it looked 
like a place of which the beauty would have had 
a sweet odor even without them. 

Lady Agnes had taken a white rose from one 
of the clusters and was holding it to her face, 
which was turned to the door, as Nick crossed 
the threshold. The expression of her figure in 
stantly told him (he saw the creased card that he 
had sent her lying on one of the beautiful bare 
tables) how she had been sailing up and down in 
a majesty of satisfaction. The inflation of her 
long, plain dress, the brightened dimness of her 
proud face, were still in the air. In a moment 
he had kissed her and was being kissed, not in 
quick repetition, but in tender prolongation, with 



262 THE JRAGIC MUSE. 

\ 

which the perfume of the white rose was mixed. 
But there was something else, too her sweet, 
smothered words in his ear : " Oh, my boy, my 
boy oh, your father, your father ! " Neither 
the sense of pleasure nor that of pain, with Lady 
Agnes (and indeed with most of the persons with 
whom this history is concerned), was a liberation 
of chatter ; so that for a minute all she said again 
was, " I think of Sir Nicholas. I wish he were 
here ; " addressing the words to Julia, who had 
wandered forward without looking at the mother 
and son. 

" Poor Sir Nicholas ! " said Mrs. Dallow, 
vaguely. 

" Did you make another speech ? " Lady Ag 
nes asked. 

" I don t know ; did I ? " Nick inquired. 

" I don t know ! " Mrs. Dallow replied, with her 
back turned, doing something to her hat before 
the glass. 

" Oh, I can fancy the confusion, the bewilder 
ment ! " said Lady Agnes, in a tone rich in polit 
ical reminiscences. 

" It was really immense fun ! " exclaimed Mrs. 
Dallow. 

" Dear Julia ! " Lady Agnes went on. Then 
she added, " It was you who made it sure." 

"There are a lot of people coming to dinner," 
said Julia. 

" Perhaps you 11 have to speak again," Lady 
Agnes smiled at her son. 



 263 

"Thank you; I like the way you talk about 
it!" cried Nick. "I m like lago : from this 
time forth I never will speak word ! 

"Don t say that, Nick," said his mother, gravely. 

" Don t be afraid ; he 11 jabber like a magpie ! " 
And Mrs. Dallow went out of the room. 

Nick had flung himself upon a sofa with an air 
of weariness, though not of completely vanished 
cheer ; and Lady Agnes stood before him, finger 
ing her rose and looking down at him. His eyes 
looked away from hers ; they seemed fixed on 
something she could not see. " I hope you ve 
thanked Julia," Lady Agnes remarked. 

" Why, of course, mother." 

" She has done as much as if you had n t been 
sure." 

" I was n t in the least sure and she has done 
everything." 

" She has been too good but we ve done 
something. I hope you don t leave out your fa 
ther," Lady Agnes amplified, as Nick s glance 
appeared for a moment to question her " we." 

" Never, never ! " Nick uttered these words 
perhaps a little mechanically, but the next minute 
he continued, as if he had suddenly been moved 
to think what he could say that would give his 
mother most pleasure : " Of course his name has 
worked for me. Gone as he is, he is still a living 
force." He felt a good deal of a hypocrite, but 
one did n t win a seat every day in the year. 
Probably, indeed, he should never win another. 



264  

" He hears you, he watches you, he rejoices in 
you," Lady Agnes declared. 

This idea was oppressive to Nick that of the 
rejoicing almost as much as of the watching. He 
had made his concession, but, with a certain im 
pulse to divert his mother from following up her 
advantage, he broke out : "Julia s a tremendously 
effective woman." 

" Of course she is ! " answered Lady Agnes, 
knowingly. 

" Her charming appearance is half the battle," 
said Nick, explaining a little coldly what he 
meant. But he felt that his coldness was an in 
adequate protection to him when he heard his 
mother observe, with something of the same sa 
pience 

" A woman is always effective when she likes 
a person." 

It discomposed him to be described as a person 
liked, and by a woman ; and he asked abruptly : 
When are you going away ? " 

"The first moment that s civil to-morrow 
morning. You 11 stay here, I hope." 

" Stay ? What shall I stay for ? " 

"Why, you might stay to thank her." 

" I have everything to do." 

" I thought everything was done," said Lady 
Agnes. 

" Well, that s why," her son replied, not very 
lucidly. "I want to do other things -- quite 
other things. I should like to take the nex- 
train." And Nick looked at his watch. 



 26$ 

" When there are people coming to dinner to 
meet you ? " 

" They 11 meet You that s better." 

" I m sorry any one is coming," Lady Agnes 
said, in a tone unencouraging to a deviation from 
the reality of things. "I wish we were alone 
just as a family. It would please Julia to-day to 
feel that we are one. Do stay with her to 
morrow." 

" How will that do, when she s alone ? " 

" She won t be alone, with Mrs. Gresham." 

" Mrs. Gresham does n t count." 

" That s precisely why I want you to stop. 
And her cousin, almost her brother : what an 
idea that it won t do ! Have n t you stayed here 
before, when there has been no one ?" 

" I have never stayed much, and there have 
always been people. At any rate, now it s dif 
ferent." 

"It s just because it is different. Besides, it 
is n t different, and it never was," said Lady Ag 
nes, more incoherent, in her earnestness, than it 
often happened to her to be. " She always liked 
you, a.id she likes you now more than ever, if 
you call that different ! " Nick got up at this 
and, without meeting her eyes, walked to one of 
the windows, where he stood with his back turned, 
looking out on the great greenness. She watched 
him a moment, and she might well have been 
wishing, while he remained gazing there, as it ap 
peared, that it would come to him with the same 



266  

force as it had come to herself (very often before, 
but during these last days more than ever), that 
the level lands of Harsh, stretching away before 
the window, the French garden, with its sym 
metry, its screens and its statues, and a great 
many more things, of which these were the su 
perficial token, were Julia s very own, to do with 
exactly as she liked. No word of appreciation 
or envy, however, dropped from the young man s 
lips, and his mother presently went on : " What 
could be more natural than that, after your trium 
phant contest, you and she should have lots to 
settle and to talk about no end of practical 
questions, no end of business ? Aren t you her 
member, and can t her member pass a day with 
her, and she a great proprietor ? " 

Nick turned round at this, with an odd expres 
sion. " Her member am I hers ? " 

Lady Agnes hesitated a moment ; she felt that 
she had need of all her tact. " Well, if the place 
is hers, and you represent the place " she began. 
But she went no further, for Nick interrupted 
her with a laugh. 

" What a droll thing to represent, when one 
thinks of it ! And what does it represent, poor 
stupid little borough, with its smell of meal and 
its curiously fat-faced inhabitants ? Did you ever 
see such a collection of fat faces, turned up at 
the hustings ? They looked like an enormous 
sofa, with the cheeks for the gathers and the eyes 
for the buttons." 



 267 

" Oh, well, the next time you shall have a great 
town," Lady Agnes replied, smiling and feeling 
that she was tactful. 

" It will only be a bigger sofa ! I m joking, 
of course," Nick went on, " and I ought to be 
ashamed of myself. They have done me the 
honor to elect me, and I shall never say a word 
that s not civil about them, poor dears. But even 
a new member may joke with his mother." 

" I wish you d be serious with your mother," 
said Lady Agnes, going nearer to him. 

" The difficulty is that I m two men ; it s the 
strangest thing that ever was," Nick pursued, 
bending his bright face upon her. " I m two 
quite distinct human beings, who have scarcely a 
point in common ; not even the memory, on the 
part of one, of the achievements or the adven 
tures of the other. One man wins the seat, but 
it s the other fellow who sits in it." 

" Oh, Nick, don t spoil your victory by your 
perversity ! " Lady Agnes cried, clasping her 
hands to him. 

" I went through it with great glee I won t 
deny that ; it excited me, it interested me, it 
amused me. When once I was in it I liked it. 
But now that I m out of it again " 

" Out of it ? " His mother stared. " Is n t the 
whole point that you re in ? " 

"Ah, now I m only in the House of Com 
mons." 

For an instant Lady Agnes seemed not to

understand and to be on the point of laying her 
finger quickly to her lips with a " Hush ! " as 
if the late Sir Nicholas might have heard the 
" only." Then, as if a comprehension of the 
young man s words promptly superseded that 
impulse, she replied with force : " You will be in 
the Lords the day you determine to get there." 

This futile remark made Nick laugh afresh, and 
not only laugh, but kiss her, which was always 
an intenser form of mystification for poor Lady 
Agnes, and apparently the one he liked best to 
practice ; after which he said, " The odd thing 
is, you know, that Harsh has no wants. At least 
it s not sharply, not eloquently conscious of them. 
We all talked them over together, and I promised 
to carry them in my heart of hearts. But upon 
my word I can t remember one of them. Julia 
says the wants of Harsh are simply the national 
wants rather a pretty phrase for Julia. She 
means she does everything for the place ; she s 
really their member, and this house in which we 
stand is their legislative chamber. Therefore 
the lacuna that I have undertaken to fill up are 
the national wants. It will be rather a job to 
rectify some of them, won t it ? I don t represent 
the appetites of Harsh Harsh is gorged. I 
represent the ideas of my party. That s what 
Julia says." 

" Oh, never mind what Julia says ! " Lady 
Agnes broke out, impatiently. This impatience 
made it singular that the very next words she 



 269 

uttered should be : " My dearest son, I wish to 
heaven you d marry her. It would be so fitting 
now ! " she added. 

" Why now ? " asked Nick, frowning. 

" She has shown you such sympathy, such de 
votion." 

" Is it for that she has shown it ? " 

"Ah, you might feel I can t tell you ! " said 
Lady Agnes, reproachfully. 

Nick blushed at this, as if what he did feel was 
the reproach. " Must I marry her because you 
like her ? " 

" I ? Why, we are all as fond of her as we 
can be." 

" Dear mother, I hope that any woman I ever 
may marry will be a person agreeable not only 
to you, but also, since you make a point of it, to 
Grace and Biddy. But I must tell you this 
that I shall marry no woman I am not unmistak 
ably in love with." 

" And why are you not in love with Julia 
charming, clever, generous as she is ? " Lady 
Agnes laid her hands on him she held him 
tight. " My darling Nick, if you care anything 
in the world to make me happy, you 11 stay over 
here to-morrow and be nice to her." 

" Be nice to her ? Do you mean propose to 
her ? " 

"With a single word, with the glance of an 
eye, the movement of your little finger " and 
Lady Agnes paused, looking intensely, implor- 



2/0  

ingly up into Nick s face " in less time than it 
takes me to say what I say now, you may have 
it all." As he made no answer, only returning 
her look, she added insistently, " You know she s 
a fine creature you know she is ! " 

" Dearest mother, what I seem to know better 
than anything else in the world is that I love my 
freedom, I set it far above everything." 

" Your freedom ? What freedom is there in 
being poor ? Talk of that when Julia puts every 
thing that she possesses at your feet ! " 

"I can t talk of it, mother it s too terrible 
an idea. And I can t talk of her, nor of what I 
think of her. You must leave that to me. I do 
her perfect justice." 

" You don t, or you d marry her to-morrow. 
You would feel that the opportunity is exquisitely 
rare, with everything in the world to make it per 
fect. Your father would have valued it for you 
beyond everything. Think a little what would 
have given him pleasure. That s what I meant 
when I spoke just now of us all. It was n t of 
Grace and Biddy I was thinking fancy! it 
was of him. He s with you always ; he takes with 
you, at your side, every step that you take your 
self. He would bless devoutly your marriage to 
Julia; he would feel what it would be for you and 
for us all. I ask for no sacrifice, and he would 
ask for none. We only ask that you don t com 
mit the crime " 

Nick Dormer stopped her with another kiss ; 



 2/1 

he murmured, " Mother, mother, mother ! " as he 
bent over her. 

He wished her not to go on, to let him off ; 
but the deep deprecation in his voice did not 
prevent her saying : " You know it you know 
it perfectly. All, and more than alt that I can 
tell you, you know." 

He drew her closer, kissed her again, held her 
there as he would have held a child in a par 
oxysm, soothing her silently till it should pass 
away. Her emotion had brought the tears to her 
eyes ; she dried them as she disengaged herself. 
The next moment, however, she resumed, attack 
ing him again : 

" For a public man she would be the ideal com 
panion. She s made for public life ; she s made 
to shine, to be concerned in great things, to oc 
cupy a high position and to help him on. She 
would help you in everything, as she has helped 
you in this. Together, there is nothing you 
could n t do. You can have the first house in 
England yes, the first ! What freedom is there 
.in being poor ? How can you do anything without 
money, and what money can you make for your 
self what money will ever come to you ? That s 
the crime to throw away such an instrument of 
power, such a blessed instrument of good." 

"It isn t everything to be rich, mother," said 
Nick, looking at the floor in a certain patient 
way, with a provisional docility and his hands in 
his pockets. " And it is n t so fearful to be 
poor." 



2/2  

" It s vile it s abject. Don t I know ? " 

"Are you in such acute want ?" Nick asked, 
smiling. 

" Ah, don t make me explain what you have 
only to look at to see! " his mother returned, as 
if with a richness of allusion to dark elements in 
her fate. 

" Besides," Nick went on, " there s other money 
in the world than Julia s. I might come by some 
of that." 

" Do you mean Mr. Carteret s ? " The question 
made him laugh, as her feeble reference, five 
minutes before, to the House of Lords had done. 
But she pursued, too full of her idea to take ac 
count of such a poor substitute for an answer : 
" Let me tell you one thing, for I have known 
Charles Carteret much longer than you, and I un 
derstand him better. There* s nothing you could 
do that would do you more good with him than 
to marry Julia. I know the way he looks at 
things, and I know exactly how that would strike 
him. It would please him, it would charm him ; 
it would be the thing that would most prove to 
him that you re in earnest. You need to do 
something of that sort." 

" Have n t I come in for Harsh ? " asked Nick. 

" Oh, he s very canny. He likes to see peo 
ple rich. Then he believes in them then he s 
likely to believe more. He s kind to you be 
cause you re your father s son ; but I m sure 
your being poor takes just so much off." 



 2/3 

" He can remedy that so easily," said Nick, 
smiling still. " Is being kept by Julia what you 
call making an effort for myself? " 

Lady Agnes hesitated ; then, " You need n t 
insult Julia ! " she replied. 

" Moreover, if I ve her money, I sha n t want 
his," Nick remarked. 

Again his mother waited an instant before an 
swering ; after which she produced : " And pray 
would n t you wish to be independent ? " 

" You re delightful, dear mother you re very 
delightful ! I particularly like your conception 
of independence. Doesn t it occur to you that 
at a pinch I might improve my fortune by some 
other means than by making a mercenary mar 
riage or by currying favor with a rich old gentle 
man ? Does n t it occur to you that I might 
work ? " 

" Work at politics ? How does that make 
money, honourably?" 

" I don t mean at politics." 

" What do you mean, then ? " Lady Agnes de 
manded, looking at him as if she challenged him 
to phrase it if he dared. Her eye appeared to 
have a certain effect upon him, for he remained 
silent, and she continued : " Are you elected or 
not ? " 

" It seems a dream," said Nick. 

" If you are, act accordingly, and don t mix up 
things that are as wide asunder as the poles ! " 
She spoke with sternness, and his silence might 



274  

have been an admission that her sternness was 
wholesome to him. Possibly she was touched by 
it ; at any rate, after a few moments, during 
which nothing more passed between them, she 
appealed to him in a gentler and more anxious 
key, which had this virtue to touch him, that he 
knew it was absolutely the first time in her life 
Lady Agnes had begged for anything. She had 
never been obliged to beg ; she had got on with 
out it and most things had come to her. He 
might judge, therefore, in what a light she re 
garded this boon for which, in her old age, she 
humbled herself to be a suitor. There was such 
a pride in her that he could feel what it cost her 
to go on her knees even to her son. He did 
judge how it was in his power to gratify her ; 
and as he was generous and imaginative he was 
stirred and shaken as it came over him in a wave 
of figurative suggestion that he might make up 
to her for many things. He scarcely needed to 
hear her ask, with a pleading wail that was almost 
tragic : " Don t you see how things have turned 
out for us ; don t you know how unhappy I am 
don t you know what a bitterness ?" She 
stopped for a moment, with a sob in her voice, 
and he recognized vividly this last tribulation, 
the unhealecl wound of her bereavement and the 
way she had sunken from eminence to flatness. 
" You know what Percival is and the comfort I 
have from him. You know the property and 
what he is doing with it and what comfort I get 



 

from that! Everything s dreary but what you 
can do for us. Everything s odious, down to liv 
ing in a hole with one s girls who don t marry. 
Grace is impossible I don t know what s the 
matter with her ; no one will look at her, and 
she s so conceited with it sometimes I feel 
as if I could beat her ! And Biddy will never 
marry, and we are three dismal women in a filthy 
house ; and what are three dismal women, more 
or less, in London ? " 

So, with an unexpected rage of self-exposure, 
Lady Agnes talked of her disappointments and 
troubles, tore away the veil from her sadness and 
soreness. It almost frightened Nick to perceive 
how she hated her life, though at another time it 
might have amused him to note how she despised 
her gardenless house. Of course it was not a 
country-house, and Lady Agnes could not get 
used to that. Better than he could do for it was 
the sort of thing into which, in any case, a wo 
man enters more than a man she felt what a lift 
into brighter air, what a regilding of his sisters 
possibilities, his marriage to Julia would effect 
for them. He could n t trace the difference, but 
his mother saw it all as a shining picture. She 
made the vision shine before him now, somehow, 
as she stood there like a poor woman crying for 
a kindness. What was filial in him, all the piety 
that he owed, especially to the revived spirit of 
his father, more than ever present on a day of 
such public pledges, was capable from one mo- 



2/6  

ment to the other of trembling into sympathetic 
response. He had the gift, so embarrassing when 
it is a question of consistent action, of seeing in 
an imaginative, interesting light anything that il 
lustrated forcibly the life of another : such things 
effected a union with something in his life, and 
the recognition of them was ready to become a 
form of enthusiasm in which there was no con 
sciousness of sacrifice none scarcely of merit. 

Rapidly, at present, this change of scene took 
place before his spiritual eye. He found himself 
believing, because his mother communicated the 
belief, that it was in his option to transform the 
social outlook of the three women who clung to 
him and who declared themselves dismal. This 
was not the highest kind of inspiration, but it was 
moving, and it associated itself with dim confu 
sions of figures in the past figures of authority 
and expectancy. Julia s wide kingdom opened 
out around him, making the future almost a daz 
zle of happy power. His mother and sisters 
floated in the rosy element with beaming faces, 
in transfigured safety. " The first house in Eng 
land," she had called it ; but it might be the first 
house in Europe, the first house in the world, by 
the fine air and the high humanities that should 
fill it. Everything that was beautiful in the place 
where he stood took on a more delicate charm ; 
the house rose over his head like a museum of 
exquisite rewards, and the image of poor George 
Dallow hovered there obsequious, as if to confess 



 2// 

that he had only been the modest, tasteful fore 
runner, appointed to set it all in order and punc 
tually retire. Lady Agnes s tone penetrated 
further into Nick s spirit than it had done yet, as 
she syllabled to him, supremely, " Don t desert 
us don t desert us." 

"Don t desert yon?" 

" Be great be great," said his mother. " I m 
old, I ve lived, I ve seen. Go in for a great ma 
terial position. That will simplify everything 
else." 

" I will do what I can for you anything, 
everything I can. Trust me leave me alone," 
said Nick Dormer. 

"And you 11 stay over you ll spend the day 
with her ? " 

" I 11 stay till she turns me out ! " 

His mother had hold of his hand again now ; 
she raised it to her lips and kissed it. " My 
dearest son, my only joy ! " Then, " I don t see 
how you can resist her," she added. 

" No more do I ! " 

Lady Agnes looked round the great room with 
a soft exhalation of gratitude and hope. " If 
you re so fond of art, what art is equal to all 
this? The joy of living in the midst of it of 
seeing the finest works every day ! You 11 have 
everything the world can give." 

" That s exactly what was just passing in my 
own mind. It s too much." 

" Don t be selfish ! " 



278  

"Selfish ?" Nick repeated. 

" Don t be unselfish, then. You 11 share it 
with us." 

"And with Julia a little, I hope," said Nick. 

" God bless you ! " cried his mother, looking up 
at him. Her eyes were detained by the sudden 
perception of something in his own that was not 
clear to her ; but before she had time to ask for 
an explanation of it Nick inquired, abruptly : 

" Why do you talk so of poor Biddy ? Why 
won t she marry ? " 

" You had better ask Peter Sherringham," said 
Lady Agnes. 

" What has he got to do with it ? " 

" How odd of you to ask, when it s so plain 
how she thinks of him that it s a matter of com 
mon chaff ! " 

" Yes, we ve made it so, and she takes it like 
an angel. But Peter likes her." 

" Does he ? Then it s the more shame to him 
to behave as he does. He had better leave his 
actresses alone. That s the love of art, too ! " 
laughed Lady Agnes. 

"Biddy s so charming she ll marry some 
one else." 

" Never, if she loves him. But Julia will bring 
it about Julia will help her," said Lady Agnes, 
more cheerfully. "That s what you 11 do for us 
that she 11 do everything ! " 

" Why then more than now ? " Nick asked. 

"Because we shall be yours." 



 2/9 

"You are mine already." 

" Yes, but she is n t. However, she s as 
good ! " exulted Lady Agnes. 

" She 11 turn me out of the house," said Nick. 

" Come and tell me when she does ! But there 
she is go to her ! " And she gave him a push 
toward one of the windows that stood open to 
the terrace. Mrs. Dallow had become visible 
outside ; she passed slowly along the terrace, 
with her long shadow. " Go to her," Lady Ag 
nes repeated " she s waiting for you." 

Nick went out with the air of a man who was 
as ready to pass that way as any other, and at 
the same moment his two sisters, freshly restored 
from the excitements of the town, came into the 
room from another quarter. 

" We go home to-morrow, but Nick will stay a 
day or two," their mother said to them. 

"Dear old Nick!" Grace ejaculated, looking 
at Lady Agnes. 

" He s going to speak," the latter went on. 
" But don t mention it." 

"Don t mention it ? " said Biddy, staring. 
" Has n t he spoken enough, poor fellow ? " 

" I mean to Julia," Lady Agnes replied. 

" Don t you understand, you goose ? " Grace 
exclaimed to her sister. 



XIV. 

THE next morning brought Nick Dormer many 
letters and telegrams, and his coffee was placed 
beside him in his room, where he remained 
until noon answering these communications. 
When he came out he learned that his mother 
and sisters had left the house. This information 
was given him by Mrs. Gresham, whom he found 
at one of the tables in the library, dealing with 
her own voluminous budget. She was a lady 
who received thirty letters a day, the subject- 
matter of which, as well as of her punctual an 
swers, in a hand that would have been " ladylike " 
in a manageress, was a puzzle to those who ob 
served her. 

She told Nick that Lady Agnes had not been 
willing to disturb him at his work to say goocl- 
by, knowing she should see him in a day or two 
in town. Nick was amused at the way his mother 
had stolen off ; as if she feared that further con 
versation might weaken the spell she believed 
herself to have wrought. The place was cleared, 
moreover, of its other visitors, so that, as Mrs- 
Gresham said, the fun was at an end. This lady 
expressed the idea that the fun was, after all, 
rather a bore. At any rate, now they could rest, 



 28 1 

Mrs. Dallow and Nick and she, and she was glad 
Nick was going to stay for a little quiet. She 
liked Harsh best when it was not en fete : then 
one could see what a sympathetic old place it 
was. She hoped Nick was not dreadfully tired ; 
she feared Julia was completely done up. Mrs. 
Dallow, however, had transported her exhaustion 
to the grounds she was wandering about some 
where. She thought more people would be com 
ing to the house, people from the town, people 
from the country, and had gone out so as not to 
have to see them. She had not gone far Nick 
could easily find her. Nick intimated that he 
himself was not eager for more people, where 
upon Mrs. Gresham said, rather archly, smiling : 
" And of course you hate me for being here." 
He made some protest, and she added, " But I m 
almost a part of the house, you know I m one 
of the chairs or tables." Nick declared that he 
had never seen a house so well furnished, and 
Mrs. Gresham said : " I believe there are to be 
some people to dinner : rather an interference, 
is n t it ? Julia lives so in public. But it s all 
for you." And after a moment she added, " It s 
a wonderful constitution." Nick at first failed 
to seize her allusion he thought it a retarded 
political reference, a sudden tribute to the great 
unwritten instrument by which they were all gov 
erned. He was on the point of saying, " The 
British ? Wonderful ! " when he perceived that 
the intention of his interlocutress was to praise 



282  

Mrs. Dallow s fine robustness. " The surface so 
delicate, the action so easy, yet the frame of 
steel." 

Nick left Mrs. Gresham to her correspondence 
and went out of the course ; wondering, as he 
walked, whether she wanted him to do the same 
thing that his mother wanted, so that her words 
had been intended for a prick whether even 
the two ladies had talked over their desire to 
gether. Mrs. Gresham was a married woman 
who was usually taken for a widow ; mainly be 
cause she was perpetually " sent for " by her 
friends, and her friends never sent for Mr. 
Gresham. She came, in every case, and had the 
air of being repandne at the expense of dingier 
belongings. Her figure was admired that is it 
was sometimes mentioned and she dressed as 
if it was expected of her to be smart, like a young 
woman in a shop or a servant much in view. She 
slipped in and out, accompanied at the piano, 
talked to the neglected visitors, walked in the 
rain, and, after the arrival of the post, usually had 
conferences with her hostess, during which she 
stroked her chin and looked familiarly responsi 
ble. It was her peculiarity that people were al 
ways saying things to her in a lowered voice. 
She had all sorts of acquaintances, and in small 
establishments she sometimes wrote the menus. 
Great ones, on the other hand, had no terrors for 
her : she had seen too many. No one had ever 
discovered whether any one else paid her. 



 283 

If Lady Agnes, in a lowered tone, had dis 
cussed with her the propriety of a union between 
the mistress of Harsh and the hope of the Dor 
mers, our young man could take the circumstance 
for granted without irritation and even with cur 
sory indulgence ; for he was not unhappy now, 
and his spirit was light and clear. The summer 
day was splendid, and the world, as he looked at 
it from the terrace, offered no more worrying am 
biguity than a vault of airy blue arching over a 
lap of solid green. The wide, still trees in the 
park appeared to be waiting for some daily in 
spection, and the rich fields, with their official 
frill of hedges, to rejoice in the light which ap 
proved them as named and numbered acres. 
The place looked happy to Nick, and he was 
struck with its having a charm to which he had 
perhaps not hitherto done justice ; something of 
the impression that he had received, when he was 
younger, from showy " views " of fine country- 
seats, as if they had been brighter and more 
established than life. There were a couple of 
peacocks on the terrace, and his eye was caught 
by the gleam of the swans on a distant lake, where 
there was also a little temple on an island ; and 
these objects fell in with his humor, which at 
another time might have been ruffled by them as 
representing the Philistine in ornament. 

It was certainly a proof of youth and health on 
his part that his spirits had risen as the tumult 
rose, and that after he had taken his jump into 



284  

the turbid waters of a contested election he had 
been able to tumble and splash, not only without 
a sense of awkwardness, but with a considerable 
capacity for the frolic. Tepid as we saw him in 
Paris, he had found his relation to his opportunity 
surprisingly altered by his little journey across 
the Channel. He saw things in a new perspec 
tive, and he breathed an air that excited him un 
expectedly. There was something in it that went 
to his head an element that his mother and his 
sisters, his father from beyond the grave, Julia 
Dallow, the Liberal party and a hundred friends 
were both secretly and overtly occupied in pump 
ing into it. If he was vague about success he 
liked the fray, and he had a general rule that 
when one was in a muddle there was refresh 
ment in action. The embarrassment, that is the 
revival of skepticism, which might produce an 
inconsistency shameful to exhibit and yet very 
difficult to conceal, was safe enough to come later 
indeed, at the risk of making our young man 
appear a purely whimsical personage : I may hint 
that some such sickly glow had even now begun 
to color one quarter of his mental horizon. 

I am afraid, moreover, that I have no better 
excuse for him than the one he had touched on 
in the momentous conversation with his mother 
which I have thought it useful to reproduce in 
full. He was conscious of a double nature ; 
there were two men in him, quite separate, whose 
leading features had little in common and each 



 285 

of whom insisted on having an independent turn 
at life. Meanwhile, if he was adequately aware 
that the bed of his moral existence would need a 
good deal of making over if he was to lie upon it 
without unseemly tossing, he was also alive to 
the propriety of not parading his inconsistencies, 
not letting his unrectified interests become a 
spectacle to the vulgar. He had none of that 
wish to appear complicated which is at the bottom 
of most forms of fatuity ; he was perfectly willing 
to pass as simple ; he only aspired to be continu 
ous. If you were not really simple, this pre 
sented difficulties ; but he would have assented to 
the proposition that you must be as clever as you 
can and that a high use of cleverness is in con 
suming the smoke of your inner fire. The fire 
was the great thing, and not the chimney. He 
had no view of life which counted out the need 
of learning ; it was teaching, rather, as to which 
he was conscious of no particular mission. He 
liked life, liked it immensely, and was willing to 
study the ways and means of it with a certain pa 
tience. He cherished the usual wise monitions, 
such as that one was not to make a fool of one s 
self and that one should not carry on one s sub 
jective experiments in public. It was because, 
as yet, he liked life in general better than it was 
clear to him that he liked any particular branch 
of it, that on the occasion of a constituency s 
holding out a cordial haud to him, while it ex 
tended another in a different direction, a certain 



286  

bloom of boyhood that was on him had not re 
sisted the idea of a match. 

He rose to it as he had risen to matches at 
school, for his boyishness could take a pleasure 
in an inconsiderate show of agility. He could 
meet electors and conciliate bores and compli 
ment women and answer questions and roll off 
speeches and chaff adversaries, because it was 
amusing and slightly dangerous, like playing 
football or ascending an Alp pastimes for 
which nature had conferred on him an aptitude 
not so very different in kind from a gallant readi 
ness on platforms. There were two voices which 
told him that all this was not really action at all, 
but only a rjusillanimous imitation of it : one of 
them made itself fitfully audible in the depths of 
his own spirit and the other spoke in the equiv 
ocal accents of a very crabbed hand, from a let 
ter of four pages by Gabriel Nash. However, 
Nick acted as much as possible under the cir 
cumstances, and that was rectifying it brought 
with it enjoyment and a working faith. He had 
not gone counter to the axiom that in a case of 
doubt one was to hold off ; for that applied to 
choice, and he had not at present the slightest 
pretension to choosing. He knew he was lifted 
along, that what he was doing was not first-rate, 
that nothing was settled by it and that if there 
was essentially a problem in his life it would only 
grow tougher with keeping. But if doing one s 
sum to-morrow instead of to-day does not make 
the sum easier, it at least makes to-day so. 



 287 

Sometimes, in the course of the following fort 
night, it seemed to him that he had gone in for 
Harsh because he was sure he should lose ; some 
times he foresaw that he should win precisely to 
punish him for having tried and for his want of 
candor ; and when presently he did win, he was 
almost frightened at his success. Then it ap 
peared to him that he had done something even 
worse than not choose he had let others choose 
for him. The beauty of it was that they had 
chosen with only their own object in their eye : 
for what did they know about his strange alterna 
tive ? He was rattled about so for a fortnight 
(Julia took care of that) that he had no time to 
think save when he tried to remember a quota 
tion or an American story, and all his life became 
an overflow of verbiage. Thought retreated be 
fore increase of sound, which had to be pleasant 
and eloquent, and even superficially coherent, 
without its aid. Nick himself was surprised at 
the airs he could play ; and often when, the last 
thing at night, he shut the door of his room, he 
mentally exclaimed that he had had no idea he 
was such a mountebank. 

I must add that if this reflection did not occupy 
him long, and if no meditation, after his return 
from Paris, held him for many moments, there 
was a reason better even than that he was tired, 
or busy, or excited by the agreeable combination 
of hits and hurrahs. That reason was simply 
Mrs. Dallow, who had suddenly become a still 



288  

larger fact in his consciousness than active pol 
itics. She was, indeed, active politics ; that is, 
if the politics were his, how little soever, the ac 
tivity was hers. She had ways of showing she 
was a clever woman that were better than saying 
clever things, which only prove at the most that 
one would be clever if one could. The accom 
plished fact itself was the demonstration that 
Mrs. Dallow could ; and when Nick came to his 
senses, after the proclamation of the victor and 
the cessation of the noise, her figure was, of all 
the queer phantasmagoria, the most substantial 
thing that survived. She had been always there, 
passing, repassing, before him, beside him, behind 
him. She had made the business infinitely pret 
tier than it would have been without her, added 
music and flowers and ices, a charm, and con 
verted it into a social game that had a strain of 
the heroic in it. It was a garden-party with 
something at stake, or to celebrate something in 
advance, with the people let in. The concluded 
affair had bequeathed to him not only a seat in 
the House of Commons, but a perception of what 
women may do, in high embodiments, and an 
abyss of intimacy with one woman in particular. 
She had wrapped him up in something, he 
did n t know what a sense of facility, an over 
powering fragrance and they had moved to 
gether in an immense fraternity. There had 
been no love-making, no contact that was only 
personal, no vulgarity of flirtation : the hurry of 



 289 

the days and the sharpness with which they both 
tended to an outside object had made all that 
irrelevant. It was as if she had been too near 
for him to see her separate from himself ; but 
none the less, when he now drew breath and 
looked back, what had happened met his eyes 
as a composed picture a picture of which the 
subject was inveterately Julia and her ponies : 
Julia wonderfully fair and fine, holding her head 
more than ever in the manner characteristic of 
her, brilliant, benignant, waving her whip, cleav 
ing the crowd, thanking people with her smile, 
carrying him beside her, carrying him to his 
doom. He had not supposed that in so few days 
he had driven about with her so much ; but the 
image of it was there, in his consulted conscience, 
as well as in a personal glow not yet chilled : it 
looked large as it rose before him. The things 
his mother had said to him made a rich enough 
frame for it, and the whole impression, that night, 
had kept him much awake. 



XV. 



WHIIE, after leaving Mrs. Gresham, he was 
hesitating which way to go and was on the point 
of hailing a gardener to ask if Mrs. Dallow had 
been seen, he noticed, as a spot of color in an 
expanse of shrubbery, a far-away parasol moving 
in the direction of the lake. He took his course 
that way, across the park, and as the bearer of 
the parasol was strolling slowly it was not five 
minutes before he had joined her. He went to 
her soundlessly over the grass (he had been whis 
tling at first, but as he got nearer he stopped), 
and it was not till he was close to her that she 
looked round. He had watched her moving as if 
she were turning things over in her mind, brush 
ing the smooth walks and the clean turf with her 
dress, slowly making her parasol revolve on her 
shoulder and carrying in the hand which hung 
beside her a book which he perceived to be a 
monthly review. 

" I came out to get away," she remarked when 
he had begun to walk with her. 

" Away from me ? " 

u Ah, that s impossible," said Mrs. Dallow. 
Then she added, " The day is so nice." 



 29! 

" Lovely weather," Nick dropped. " You want 
to get away from Mrs. Gresham, I suppose." 

Mrs. Dallow was silent a moment. " From 
everything ! " 

" Well, I want to get away too." 

" It has been such a racket. Listen to the 
dear birds." 

" Yes, our noise is n t so good as theirs," said 
Nick. " I feel as if I had been married and had 
shoes and rice thrown after me," he went on. 
" But not to you, Julia nothing so good as 
that." 

Mrs. Dallow made no answer to this ; she only 
turned her eyes on the ornamental water, which 
stretched away at their right. In a moment she 
exclaimed, " How nasty the lake looks ! " and 
Nick recognized in the tone of the words a mani 
festation of that odd shyness a perverse stiff 
ness at a moment when she probably only wanted 
to be soft which, taken in combination with her 
other qualities, was so far from being displeasing 
to him that it represented her nearest approach 
to extreme charm. He was not shy now, for he 
considered, this morning, that he saw things very 
straight and in a sense altogether superior and 
delightful. This enabled him to be generously 
sorry for his companion, if he were the reason of 
her being in any degree uncomfortable, and yet 
left him to enjoy the prettiness of some of the 
signs by which her discomfort was revealed. He 
would not insist on anything yet : so he observed 



292 THE TRAGIC ML SE. 

that his cousin s standard in lakes was too high, 
and then talked a little about his mother and the 
girls, their having gone home, his not having seen 
them that morning, Lady Agnes s deep satisfac 
tion in his victory and the fact that she would 
be obliged to " do something " for the autumn 
take a house, or something. 

" I 11 lend her a house," said Mrs. Dallow. 

" Oh, Julia, Julia ! " Nick exclaimed. 

But Mrs. Dallow paid no attention to his ex 
clamation ; she only held up her review and said : 
" See what I have brought with me to read 
Mr. Hoppus s article." 

" That s right ; then / sha n t have to. You 11 
tell me about it." He uttered this without believ 
ing that she had meant or wished to read the ar 
ticle, which was entitled "The Revision of the 
British Constitution," in spite of her having en 
cumbered herself with the stiff, fresh magazine. 
He was conscious that she was not in want of 
such mental occupation as periodical literature 
could supply. They walked along and then he 
added, "But is that what we are in for read 
ing Mr. Hoppus ? Is that the sort of thing that 
constituents expect? Or even worse, pretending 
to have read him when one has n t ? Oh, what a 
tangled web we weave ! " 

" People are talking about it. One has to 
know. It s the article of the month." 

Nick looked at his companion askance a mo 
ment. "You say things every now and then for 



THE TRAGIC .If USE. 293 

which I could kill you. The article of the 
month/ for instance : I could kill you for that." 

" Well, kill me ! " Mrs. Dallow exclaimed. 

" Let me carry your book," Nick rejoined, irrel 
evantly. The hand in which she held it was on 
the side of her on which he was walking, and he 
put out his own hand to take it. But for a couple 
of minutes she forbore to give it up, and they 
held it together, swinging it a little. Before she 
surrendered it he inquired where she was going. 

" To the island," she answered. 

"Well, I ll go with you and I ll kill you 
there." 

"The things I say are the right things," said 
Mrs. Dallow. 

"It s just the right things that are wrong. 
It s because you re so political," Nick went on. 
" It s your horrible ambition. The woman who 
has a salon should have read the article of the 
month. See how one dreadful thing leads to 
another." 

"There are some things that lead to nothing." 

"No doubt no doubt. And how are you 
going to get over to your island ? " 

"I don t know." 

" Isn t there a boat?" 

" I don t know." 

Nick had paused a moment, to look round for 
the boat, but Mrs. Dallow walked on, without 
turning her head. " Can you row ? " her com 
panion asked. 



294  

" Don t you know I can do everything ? " 

" Yes, to be sure. That s why I want to kill 
you. There s the boat." 

" Shall you drown me ? " asked Mrs. Dallow. 

" Oh, let me perish with you ! " Nick answered 
with a sigh. The boat had been hidden from 
them by the bole of a great tree, which rose from 
the grass at the water s edge. It was moored to 
a small place of embarkation and was large 
enough to hold as many persons as were likely 
to wish to visit at once the little temple in the 
middle of the lake, which Nick liked because it 
was absurd and Mrs. Dallow had never had a 
particular esteem for. The lake, fed by a natural 
spring, was a liberal sheet of water, measured by 
the scale of park scenery ; and though its prin 
cipal merit was that, taken at a distance, it gave 
a gleam of abstraction to the concrete verdure, 
doing the office of an open eye in a dull face, it 
could also be approached without derision on a 
sweet summer morning, when it made a lapping 
sound and reflected candidly various things that 
were probably finer than itself the sky, the 
great trees, the flight of birds. 

A man of taste, a hundred year s before, com 
ing back from Rome, had caused a small orna 
mental structure to be erected, on artificial foun 
dations, on its bosom, and had endeavored to 
make this architectural pleasantry as nearly as 
possible a reminiscence of the small ruined ro 
tunda which stands on the bank of the Tiber and 



 

is declared by ciceroni to have been dedicated to 
Vesta. It was circular, it was roofed with old 
tiles, it was surrounded by white columns and it 
was considerably dilapidated. George Dallow 
had taken an interest in it (it reminded him not 
in the least of Rome, but of other things that he 
liked), and had amused himself with restoring it. 

" Give me your hand ; sit there, and I 11 ferry 
you," Nick Dormer said. 

Mrs. Dallow complied, placing herself opposite 
to him in the boat ; but as he took up the paddles 
she declared that she preferred to remain on the 
water there was too much malice prepense in 
the temple. He asked her what she meant by 
that, and she said it was ridiculous to withdraw 
to an island a few feet square on purpose to med 
itate. She had nothing to meditate about which 
required so much attitude. 

" On the contrary, it would be just to change 
the pcse. It s what we have been doing for a 
week that s attitude ; and to be for half an hour 
where nobody s looking and one hasn t to keep 
it up is just what I wanted to put in an idle, irre 
sponsible day for. I am not keeping it up now 
I suppose you ve noticed," Nick went on, as 
they floated and he scarcely dipped the oars. 

"I don t understand you," said Mrs. Dallow, 
leaning back in the boat. 

Nick gave no further explanation than to ask 
in a minute, " Have you people to dinner to 
night ? " 



296  

" I believe there are three or four, but I 11 put 
them off if you like." 

" Must you always live in public, Julia ? " Nick 
continued. 

She looked at him a moment, and he could see 
that she colored slightly. " We 11 go home 
I 11 put them off." 

;&lt; Ah no, don t go home; it s too jolly here. 
Let them come let them come, poor wretches ! " 

" How little you know me, when, ever so many 
times, I have lived here for months without a 
creature ! " 

"Except Mrs. Gresham, I suppose." 

"I have had to have the house going, I admit." 

" You re perfect, you re admirable, and I don t 
criticise you." 

" I don t understand you ! " she tossed back. 

"That only adds to the generosity of what you 
have done for me," Nick returned, beginning to 
pull faster. He bent over the oars and sent the 
boat forward, keeping this up for ten minutes, 
during which they both remained silent. His 
companion, in her place, motionless, reclining 
(the seat in the stern was very comfortable), 
looked only at the water, the sky, the trees. 
At last Nick headed for the little temple, saying 
first, however, " Sha n t we visit the ruin ? " 

"If you like. I don t mind seeing how they 
keep it." 

They reached the white steps which led up to 
it. Nick held the boat, and Mrs. Dallow got out. 



 

He fastened the boat, and they went up the steps 
together, passing through the open door. 

" They keep it very well," Nick said, looking 
round. "It s a capital place to give up every 
thing." 

" It might do for you to explain what you 
mean," said Julia, sitting down. 

"I mean to pretend for half an hour that I 
don t represent the burgesses of Harsh. It s 
charming it s very delicate work. Surely it 
has been retouched." 

The interior of the pavilion, lighted by win 
dows which the circle of columns was supposed, 
outside and at a distance, to conceal, had a 
vaulted ceiling and was occupied by a few pieces 
of last-century furniture, spare and faded, of 
which the colors matched with the decoration of 
the walls. These and the ceiling, tinted and not 
exempt from indications of damp, were covered 
with fine mouldings and medallions. It was a 
very elegant little teahouse. 

Mrs. Dallow sat on the edge of a sofa, rolling 
her parasol and remarking, " You ought to read 
Mr. Hoppus s article to me." 

" Why, is this your salon ? " asked Nick, smil 
ing. 

" Why are you always talking of that ? It s 
an invention of your own." 

" But is n t it the idea you care most about ? " 

Suddenly, nervously, Mrs. Dallow put up her 
parasol and sat under it, as if she were not quite 



298  

sensible of what she was doing. How much 
you know me ! I don t care about anything 
that you will ever guess." 

Nick Dormer wandered about the room, look 
ing at various things it contained the odd vol 
umes on the tables, the bits of quaint china on 
the shelves. " They keep it very well ; you ve 
got charming things." 

" They re supposed to come over every day 
and look after them." 

" They must come over in force." 

" Oh, no one knows." 

" It s spick and span. How well you have 
everything done ! " 

" I think you ve some reason to say so," said 
Mrs. Dallow. Her parasol was down, and she 
was again rolling it tight. 

" But you re right about my not knowing you. 
Why were you so ready to do so much for me ? " 

He stopped in front- of her and she looked up 
at him. Her eyes rested on his a minute ; then 
she broke out, " Why do you hate me so ? " 

" Was it because you like me personally ? " 
Nick asked. " You may think that an odd, or 
even an odious question ; but is n t it natural, my 
wanting to know ? " 

" Oh, if you don t know ! " Mrs. Dallow ex 
claimed. 

" It s a question of being sure." 

" Well, then, if you re not sure " 

" Was it done for me as a friend, as a man ? " 



 299 

" You re not a man ; you re a child," said his 
hostess, with a face that was cold, though she 
had been smiling the moment before. 

" After all, I was a good candidate," Nick went 
on. 

" What do I care for candidates ? " 

" You re the most delightful woman, Julia," 
said Nick, sitting down beside her, "and I can t 
imagine what you mean by my hating you." 

" If you have n t discovered that I like you, you 
might as well." 

" Might as well discover it? " 

Mrs. Dallow was grave ; he had never seen her 
so pale and never so beautiful. She had stopped 
rolling her parasol now ; her hands were folded 
in her lap and her eyes were bent on them. Nick 
sat looking at them, too, a trifle awkwardly. 
" Might as well have hated me," said Mrs. Dallow. 

" We have got on so beautifully together, all 
these days : why should n t we get on as well for 
ever and ever?" Mrs. Dallow made no answer, 
and suddenly Nick said to her : " Ah, Julia, I 
don t know what you have done to me, but you ve 
done it. You ve done it by strange ways, but it 
will serve. Yes, I hate you," he added, in a dif 
ferent tone, with his face nearer to hers. 

" Dear Nick dear Nick " she began. But 
she stopped, for she suddenly felt that he was al 
together nearer, nearer than he had ever been to 
her before, that his arm was round her, that he 
was in possession of her. She closed her eyes, 



3OO  

but she heard him ask : " Why should n t it be 
forever, forever ? " in a voice that had, for her 
ear, such a vibration as no voice had ever had. 

" You ve done it you ve done it," Nick re 
peated. 

" What do you want of me ? " she demanded. 

" To stay with me, this way, always." 

" Ah, not this way," she answered, softly, but 
as if in pain, and making an effort, with a certain 
force, to detach herself. 

"This way, then or this!" He took such 
insistent advantage of her that he had quickly 
kissed her. She rose as quickly, but he held her 
yet, and while he did so he said to her in the 
same tender tone, " If you 11 marry me, why 
should n t it be so simple, so good ? " He drew 
her closer again, too close for her to answer. 
But her struggle ceased and she rested upon him 
for a minute ; she buried her face on his breast. 

" You re hard, and it s cruel ! " she then ex 
claimed, breaking away. 

" Hard cruel ? " 

"You do it with so little!" And with this, 
unexpectedly to Nick, Mrs. Dallow burst straight 
into tears. Before he could stop her she was at 
the door of the pavilion, as if she wished to quit 
it immediately. There, however, he stopped her, 
bending over her while she sobbed, unspeakably 
gentle with her. 

" So little ? It s with everything with every 
thing I have." 



 30 1 

" I have done it, you say ? What do you ac 
cuse me of doing ? " Her tears were already 
over. 

" Of making me yours ; of being so precious, 
Julia, so exactly what a man wants, as it seems 
to me. I did n t know you could," he went on, 
smiling down at her. " I did n t no, I did n t." 

"It s what I say that you ve always hated 
me." 

" I 11 make it up to you." 

She leaned on the doorway with her head 
against the lintel. &lt;; You don t even deny it." 

" Contradict you now ? I 11 admit it, though 
it s rubbish, on purpose to live it down." 

" It does n t matter," she said, slowly ; " for 
however much you might have liked me, you 
would never have done so half as much as I have 
cared for you." 

" Oh, I m so poor ! " Nick murmured, cheer 
fully. 

She looked at him, smiling, and slowly shook 
her head. Then she declared, "You never 
can." 

" I like that ! Have n t I asked you to marry 
me ? When did you ever ask me ? " 

" Every day of my life ! As I say, it s hard 
for a proud woman." 

" Yes, you re too proud even to answer me." 

"We must think of it, we must talk of it." 

" Think of it ? I ve thought of it, ever so 
much." 



302 , 

" I mean together. There are things to be 
said." 

"The principal thing is to give me your 
word." 

Mrs. Dallow looked at him in silence ; then she 
exclaimed, " I wish I did n t adore you ! " She 
went straight down the steps. 

" You don t, if you leave me now. Why do 
you go? It s so charming here, and we are so 
delightfully alone." 

" Detach the boat ; we 11 go on the water," said 
Mrs. Dallow. 

Nick was at the top of the steps, looking 
down at her. " Ah, stay a little do stay ! " he 
pleaded. 

" I 11 get in myself, I 11 put off," she answered. 

At this Nick came down, and he bent a little 
to undo the rope. He was close to her, and as 
he raised his head he felt it caught ; she had 
seized it in her hands, and she pressed her lips to 
the first place they encountered. The next in 
stant she was in the boat. 

This time he dipped the oars very slowly in 
deed ; and while, for a period that was longer 
than it seemed to them, they floated vaguely, 
they mainly sat and glowed at each other, as if 
everything had been settled. There were reasons 
enough why Nick should be happy ; but \\ is a 
singular fact that the leading one was the sense 
of having escaped from a great mistake. The 
final result of his mother s appeal to him the day 



 303 

before had been the idea that he must act with 
unimpeachable honor. He was capable of taking 
it as an assurance that Julia had placed him un 
der an obligation which a gentleman could regard 
only in one way. If she had understood it so, 
putting the vision, or at any rate the appreciation, 
of a closer tie into everything she had done for 
him, the case was conspicuously simple and his 
course unmistakably plain. That is why he had 
been gay when he came out of the house to look 
for her : he could be gay when his course was 
plain. He could be all the gayer, naturally, I 
must add, that in turning things over, as he had 
done half the night, what he had turned up often- 
est was the recognition that Julia now had a new 
personal power over him. It was not for nothing 
that she had thrown herself personally into his 
life. She had by her act made him live twice as 
much, and such a service, if a man had accepted 
and deeply tasted it, was certainly a thing to put 
him on his honor. Nick gladly recognized that 
there was nothing he could do in preference that 
would not be spoiled for him by any deflection 
from that point. His mother had made him un 
comfortable by intimating to him that Julia was 
in love with him (he did n t like, in general, to be 
told such things) ; but the responsibility seemed 
easier to carry, and he was less shy about it, when 
once he was away from other eyes, with only 
Julia s own to express that truth and with indif 
ferent nature all around. Besides, what dis- 



304  

covery had he made this morning but that he 
also was in love ? 

" You must be a very great man," she said to 
him, in the middle of the lake. " I don t know 
what you mean, about my salon ; but I am am 
bitious." 

"We must look at life in a large, bold way," 
Nick replied, resting his oars. 

" That s what I mean. If I did n t think you 
could I would n t look at you." 

" I could what ? " 

"Do everything you ought everything I im 
agine, I dream of. You are clever : you can 
never make me believe the contrary, after your 
speech on Tuesday. Don t speak to me ! I ve 
seen, I ve heard, and I know what s in you. I 
shall hold you to it. You are everything that you 
pretend not to be." 

Nick sat looking at the water while she talked. 
" Will it always be so amusing ? " he asked. 

" Will what always be ? " 

" Why, my career." 

" Sha n t I make it so ? " 

" It will be yours ; it won t be mine," said 
Nick. 

" Ah, don t say that : don t make me out that 
sort of woman ! If they should say it s me, I d 
drown myself." 

" If they should say what s you ? " 

" Why, your getting on. If they should say 
I push you, that I do things for you." 



 305 

" Well, won t you do them ? It s just what I 
count on." 

"Don t be dreadful," said Mrs. Dallow. "It 
would be loathsome if I were said to be cleverer 
than you. That s not the sort of man I want to 
marry." 

" Oh, I shall make you work, my dear ! " 

"Ah, that!" exclaimed Mrs. Dallow, in a tone 
that might come back to a man in after years. 

"You will do the great thing, you will make 
my life delightful," Nick declared, as if he fully 
perceived the sweetness of it. " I dare say that 
will keep me in heart." 

" In heart ? Why should n t you be in heart ? " 
Julia s eyes, lingering on him, searching him, 
seemed to question him still more fhan her lips. 

"Oh, it will be all right ! " cried Nick. 

" You 11 like success, as well as any one else. 
Don t tell me you re not so ethereal ! " 

"Yes, I shall like success." 

" So shall I ! And of course I am glad that 
you ll be able to do things," Mrs. Dallow went 
on. " 1 m glad you 11 have things. I m ,glad 
I m not poor." 

"Ah, don t speak of that," Nick murmured. 
" Only be nice to my mother ; we shall make her 
supremely happy." 

" I m glad I like your people," Mrs. Dallow 
dropped. " Leave them to me ! " 

" You re generous you re noble," stammered 
Nick V 



306  

" Your mother must live at Broadwood ; she 
must have it for life. It s not at all bad." 

" Ah, Julia," her companion replied, "it s well 
I love you ! " 

" Why should n t you ? " laughed Julia ; and 
after this there was nothing said between them 
till the boat touched the shore. When she had 
got out Mrs. Dallow remarked that it was time 
for luncheon ; but they took no action in conse 
quence, strolling in a direction which was not 
that of the house. There was a vista that drew 
them on, a grassy path skirting the foundations 
of scattered beeches and leading to a stile from 
which the charmed wanderer might drop into an 
other division of Mrs. Dallovv s property. This 
lady said something about their going as far as 
the stile ; then, the next instant, she exclaimed, 
" How stupid of you you ve forgotten Mr. 
Hoppus ! " 

" We left him in the temple of Vesta. Darling, 
I had other things to think of there." 

" I 11 send for him," said Mrs. Dallow. 

"^ord, can you think of him now?" Nick 
asked. 

" Of course I can more than ever." 

" Shall we go back for him ? " Nick inquired, 
pausing. 

Mrs. Dallow made no answer ; she continued 
to walk, saying they would go as far as the stile. 
" Of course I know you re fearfully vague," she 
presently resumed. 



 307 

" I was n t vague at all. But you were in such 
a hurry to get away." 

" It does n t signify. I have another one at 
home." 

" Another summer-house ? " suggested Nick. 

" A copy of Mr. Hoppus." 

" Mercy, how you go in for him ! Fancy hav 
ing two ! " 

"He sent me the number of the magazine; 
and the other is the one that comes every 
month." 

" Every month I see," said Nick, in a man 
ner justifying considerably Mrs. Dallow s charge 
of vagueness. They had reached the stile and he 
leaned over it, looking at a great mild meadow 
and at the browsing beasts in the distance. 

"Did you suppose they come every day?" 
asked Mrs. Dallow. 

" Dear, no, thank God ! " They remained there 
a little ; he continued to look at the animals, and 
before long he added : " Delightful English pas 
toral scene. Why do they say it won t paint ? " 

"Who says it won t?" 

"I oon t know some of them. It will in 
France ; but somehow it won t here." 

" What are you talking about ? " Mrs. Dallow 
demanded. 

Nick appeared unable to satisfy her on this 
point ; at any rate, instead of answering her di 
rectly he said : " Is Broadwood very charm- 
ing?" 



308  

" Have you never been there ? It shows how 
you ve treated me. We used to go there in 
August. George had ideas about it," added Mrs. 
Dallow. She had never affected not to speak of 
her late husband, especially with Nick, whose 
kinsman, in a manner, he had been and who had 
liked him better than some others did. 

" George had ideas about a great many things." 

Julia Dallow appeared to be conscious that it 
would be rather odd, on such an occasion, to take 
this up. It was even odd in Nick to have said it. 
"Broadwood is just right," she rejoined at last. 
" It s neither too small nor too big, and it takes 
care of itself. There s nothing to be done : you 
can t spend a penny." 

" And don t you want to use it ? " 

" We can go and stay with them said Mrs. 
Dallow. 

" They 11 think I bring them an angel." And 
Nick covered her hand, which was resting on the 
stile, with his own large one. 

" As they regard you yourself as an angel they 
will take it as natural of you to associate with 
your kind." 

" Oh, my kind ! " murmured Nick, looking at 
the cows. 

Mrs. Dallow turned away from him, as if she 
were starting homeward, and he began to retrace 
his steps with her. Suddenly she said : " What 
did you mean, that night in Paris ? " 

" That night ? " 



 309 

" When you came to the hotel with me, after 
we had all dined at that place with Peter." 

" What did I mean ? " 

" About your caring so much for the fine arts. 
You seemed to want to frighten me." 

" \Vhy should you have been frightened ? I 
can t imagine what I had in my head : not 
now." 

" You are vague," said Julia, with a little flush. 

" Not about the great thing." 

"The great thing?" 

" That I owe you everything an honest man 
has to offer. How can I care about the fine arts 
now ? " 

Mrs. Dallow stopped, looking at. him. " Is it 
because you think you owe it " and she paused, 
still with the heightened color in her cheek ; then 
she went on " that you have spoken to me as 
you did there ? " She tossed her head toward 
the lake. 

" I think I spoke to you because I could n t 
help it." 

" You are vague ! " And Mrs. Dallow walked 
on again. 

" You affect me differently from any other wo 
man. . 

" Oh, other women ! Why should n t you care 
about the fine arts now ? " she added. 

" There will be no time. All my days and 
my years will be none too much to do what you 
expect of me." 



3IO  

" I don t expect you to give up anything. I 
only expect you to do more." 

" To do more I must do less. I have no tal 
ent." 

" No talent ? " 

" I mean for painting." 

Mrs. Dallow stopped again. " That s odious ! 
You have you must." 

Nick burst out laughing. " You re altogether 
delightful. But how little you know about it 
about the honorable practice of any art ! " 

" What do you call practice ? You 11 have all 
our things you ll live in the midst of them." 

"Certainly I shall enjoy looking at them, being 
so near them." 

" Don t say I ve taken you away then." 

" Taken me away ? " 

" From the love of art. I like them myself 
now, poor George s treasures. I did n t, of old, 
so much, because it seemed to me he made too 
much of them he was always talking." 

" Well, I won t talk," said Nick. 

" You may do as you like they re yours." 

" Give them to the nation," Nick went on. 

" I like that ! When we have done with 
them." 

" We shall have done with them when your 
Vandykes and Moronis have cured me of the de 
lusion that I may be of their family. Surely that 
won t take long." 

" You shall paint me" said Julia. 



THE TRAGIC MUSK. 31! 

" Never, never, never ! " Nick uttered these 
words in a tone that made his companion stare ; 
and he appeared slightly embarrassed at this re 
sult of his emphasis. To relieve himself he said, 
as they had come back to the place beside the 
lake where the boat was moored, " Sha n t we 
really go and fetch Mr. Hoppus ? " 

She hesitated. " You may go ; I won t, please." 

" That s not what I want." 

" Oblige me by going. I 11 wait here." With 
which Mrs. Dallow sat down on the bench at 
tached to the little landing. 

Nick, at this, got into the boat and put off ; 
he smiled at her as she sat there watching him. 
He made his short journey, disembarked and 
went into the pavilion ; but when he came out 
with the object of his errand he saw that Mrs. 
Dallow had quitted her station she had re 
turned to the house without him. He rowed 
back quickly, sprang ashore and followed her 
with long steps. Apparently she had gone fast ; 
she had almost reached the door when he over 
took her. 

" Why did you basely desert me ? " he asked, 
stopping her there. 

" I don t know. Because I m so happy." 

" May I tell mother ? " 

"You may tell her she shall have Broadwood."

XVI. 

NICK lost no time in going down to see Mr. 
Carteret, to whom he had written immediately 
after the election and who had answered him in 
twelve revised pages of historical parallel. He 
used often to envy Mr. Carteret s leisure, a sense 
of which came to him now afresh, in the summer 
evening, as he walked up the hill toward the 
quiet house where enjoyment, for him, had ever 
been mingled with a vague oppression. He was 
a little boy again, under Mr. Carteret s roof a 
little boy on whom it had been duly impressed 
that in the wide, plain, peaceful rooms he was 
not to " touch." When he paid a visit to his fa 
ther s old friend there were in fact many things 
many topics from which he instinctively 
kept his hands. Even Mr. Chayter, the imme 
morial blank butler, who was so like his master 
that he might have been a twin brother, helped 
to remind him that he must be good. Mr. Car 
teret seemed to Nick a very grave person, but 
he had the sense that Chayter thought him 
rather frivolous. 

Our young man always came on foot from the 
station, leaving his portmanteau to be carried : 
the direct way was steep and he liked the slow 



 313 

approach, which gave him a chance to look about 
the place and smell the new-mown hay. At this 
season the air was full of it the fields were so 
near that it was in the small, e,mpty streets. Nick 
would never have thought of rattling up to Mr. 
Carteret s door. It had an old brass plate, with 
his name, as if he had been the principal surgeon. 
The house was in the high part, and the neat 
roofs of other houses, lower down the hill, made 
an immediate prospect for it, scarcely counting, 
however, for the green country was just below 
these, familiar and interpenetrating, in the shape 
of small but thick-tufted gardens. There was 
something growing in all the intervals, and the 
only disorder of the place was that there were 
sometimes oats on the pavements. A crooked 
lane, very clean, with cobblestones, opened oppo 
site to Mr. Carteret s house and wandered towards 
the old abbey ; for the abbey was the secondary 
fact of Beauclere, after Mr. Carteret. Mr. Car- 
teret sometimes went away and the abbey never 
did ; yet somehow it was most of the essence of 
the place that it possessed the proprietor of the 
squarest of the square red houses, with the finest 
of the arched hall-windows, in three divisions, 
over the widest of the last-century doorways. 
You saw the great abbey from the doorstep, be 
yond the gardens of course, and in the stillness 
you could hear the flutter of the birds that circled 
round its huge, short towers. The towers had 
never been finished, save as time finishes things, 






314  

by perpetuating their incompleteness. There is 
., something right in old monuments that have been 
wrong for centuries : some such moral as that 
was usually in Nick s mind, as an emanation of 
Beauclere, when he looked at the magnificent 
line of the roof riding the sky and unsurpassed 
for length. 

When the door with the brass plate was opened 
and Mr. Chayter appeared in the middle distance 
(he always advanced just to the same spot, like a 
prime minister receiving an ambassador), Nick 
saw anew that he would be wonderfully like Mr. 
Carteret if he had had an expression. He did 
not permit himself this freedom ; never giving a 
sign of recognition, often as the young man had 
been at the house. He was most attentive to 
the visitor s wants, but apparently feared that if 
he allowed a familiarity it might go too far. 
There was always the same question to be asked 
- had Mr. Carteret finished his nap ? He usu 
ally had not finished it, and this left Nick what 
he liked time to smoke a cigarette in the gar 
den, or even, before dinner, to take a turn about 
the place. He observed now, every tirne he 
came, that Mr. Carteret s nap lasted a little 
longer. There was, each year, a little more 
strength to be gathered for the ceremony of din 
ner : this was the principal symptom almost 
the only one that the clear-cheeked old gentle 
man gave of not being so fresh as of yore. He 
was still wonderful for his age. To day he was 



 315 

particularly careful : Chayter went so far as to 
mention to Nick that four gentlemen were ex 
pected to dinner an effusiveness perhaps partly 
explained by the circumstance that Lord Bottom- 
ley was one of them. 

The prospect of Lord Bottomley was, some 
how, not stirring ; it only made the young man 
say to himself with a quick, thin sigh, " This time 
I am in for it ! " And he immediately had the 
unpolitical sense again that there was nothing so 
pleasant as the way the quiet bachelor house had 
its best rooms on the big garden, which seemed 
to advance into them through their wide windows 
and ruralize their dullness. 

" I expect it will be a lateish eight, sir," said 
Mr. Chayter, superintending, in the library, the 
production of tea on a large scale. Everything 
at Mr. Carteret s appeared to Nick to be on a 
larger scale than anywhere else the tea-cups, 
the knives and forks, the door-handles, the chair- 
backs, the legs of mutton, the candles and the 
lumps of coal : they represented, and apparently 
exhausted, the master s sense of pleasing effect, 
for the house was not otherwise decorated. Nick 
thought it really hideous, but he was capable at 
the same time of extracting a degree of amuse 
ment from anything that was strongly character 
istic, and Mr. Carteret s interior expressed a 
whole view of life. Our young man was gener 
ous enough to find a hundred instructive intima 
tions in it even at the time it came over him (as 



3l6  

it always did at Beauclere) that this was the view 
he himself was expected to take. Nowhere were 
the boiled eggs, at breakfast, so big or in such 
big receptacles ; his own shoes, arranged in his 
room, looked to him vaster there than at home. 
He went out into the garden and remembered 
what enormous strawberries they should have for 
dinner. In the house there was a great deal of 
Landseer, of oilcloth, of woodwork painted and 
" grained." 

Finding that he should have time before the 
evening meal, or before Mr. Carteret would be 
able to see him, he quitted the house and took a 
stroll toward the abbey. It covered acres of 
ground, on the summit of the hill, and there were 
aspects in which its vast bulk reminded him of 
the ark left high and dry upon Ararat. At least 
it was the image of a great wreck, of the inde 
structible vessel of a faith, washed up there by a 
storm centuries before. The injury of time 
added to this appearance the infirmities around 
which, as he knew, the battle of restoration had 
begun to be fought. The cry had been raised 
to save the splendid pile, and the counter-cry by 
the purists, the sentimentalists, whatever they 
were, to save it from being saved. They were 
all exchanging compliments in the morning pa 
pers. 

Nick sauntered round the church it took a 
good while ; he leaned against low things and 
looked up at it while he smoked another cigarette. 



 317 

It struck him as a great pity it should be touched : 
so much of the past was buried there that it was 
like desecrating, like digging up a grave. And 
the years seemed to be letting it down so gently : 
why jostle the elbow of slow-fingering time ? The 
fading afternoon was exquisitely pure ; the place 
was empty ; he heard nothing but the cries of 
several children, which sounded sweet, who were 
playing on the flatness of the very old tombs. He 
knew that this would inevitably be one of the 
topics at dinner, the restoration of the abbey ; it 
would give rise to a considerable deal of orderly 
debate. Lord Bottomley, oddly enough, would 
probably oppose the expensive project, but on 
grounds that would be characteristic of him even 
if the attitude were not. Nick s nerves, on this 
spot, always knew what it was to be soothed ; but 
he shifted his position with a slight impatience 
as the vision came over him of Lord Bottomley s 
treating a question of aesthetics. It was enough 
to make one want to take the other side, the idea 
of having the same taste as his lordship : one 
would have it for such different reasons. 

Dear Mr. Carteret would be deliberate and fair 
all round, and would, like his noble friend, exhibit 
much more architectural knowledge than he, Nick, 
possessed : which would not make it a whit less 
droll to our young man that an artistic idea, so 
little really assimilated, should be broached at that 
table and in that air. It would remain so outside 
of their minds, and their minds would remain so 



318  

outside of it. It would be dropped at last, how 
ever, after half an hour s gentle worrying, and the 
conversation would incline itself to public affairs. 
Mr. Carteret would find his natural level the 
production of anecdote in regard to the formation 
of early ministries. He knew more than any one 
else about the personages of whom certain cabi 
nets would have consisted if they had not con 
sisted of others. His favorite exercise was to 
illustrate how different everything might have 
been from what it was, and how the reason of 
the difference had always been somebody s inabil 
ity to "see his way " to accept the view of some 
body else a view usually, at the time, discussed, 
in strict confidence, with Mr. Carteret, who sur 
rounded his actual violation of that confidence, 
thirty years later, with many precautions against 
scandal. In this retrospective vein, at the head 
of his table, the old gentleman always enjoyed 
an audience, or at any rate commanded a silence, 
often profound. Every one left it to some one 
else to ask another question ; and when by 
chance some one else did so every one was struck 
with admiration at any one s being able to say 
anything. Nick knew the moment when he him 
self would take a glass of a particular port and, 
surreptitiously looking at his watch, perceive it 
was ten o clock. It might as well be 1830. 

All this would be a part of the suggestion of 
leisure that invariably descended upon him at 
Beauclere the image of a sloping shore where 



 319 

the tide of time broke with a ripple too faint to 
be a warning. But there was another admoni 
tion that was almost equally sure to descend upon 
his spirit in a summer hour, in a stroll about the 
grand abbey ; to sink into it as the light lingered 
on the rough red walls and the local accent of the 
children sounded soft in the churchyard. It was 
simply the sense of England a sort of appre 
hended revelation of his country. The dim an 
nals of the place appeared to be in the air (foun 
dations bafflingly early, a great monastic life, 
wars of the Roses, with battles and blood in the 
streets, and then the long quietude of the respec 
table centuries, all corn-fields and magistrates 
and vicars), and these things were connected with 
an emotion that arose from the green country, 
the rich land so infinitely lived in, and laid on 
him a hand that was too ghostly to press and yet, 
somehow, too urgent to be light. It produced a 
throb that he could not have spoken of, it was so 
deep, and that was half imagination and half re 
sponsibility. These impressions melted together 
and made a general appeal, of which, with his new 
honors as a legislator, he was the sentient sub 
ject. If he had a love for this particular scene 
of life, might it not have a love for him and ex 
pect something of him ? What fate could be so 
high as to grow old in a national affection ? What 
a grand kind of reciprocity, making mere sore 
ness of all the balms of indifference ! 

The great church was still open, and he turned 



320  

into it and wandered a little in the twilight, which 
had gathered earlier there. The whole structure, 
with its immensity of height and distance, seemed 
to rest on tremendous facts facts of achieve 
ment and endurance and the huge Norman 
pillars to loom through the dimness like the 
ghosts of heroes. Nick was more struck with 
its human than with its divine significance, and 
he felt the oppression of his conscience as he 
walked slowly about. It was in his mind that 
nothing in life was really clear, all things were 
mingled and charged, and that patriotism might 
be an uplifting passion even if it had to allow for 
Lord Bottomley and for Mr. Carteret s blindness 
on certain sides. Presently he perceived it was 
nearly half past seven, and as he went back to 
his old friend s he could not have told you whether 
he was in a state of gladness or of gloom. 

" Mr. Carteret will be in the drawing-room at a 
quarter to eight, sir," Chayter said ; and Nick, as 
he went to his chamber, asked himself what was 
the use of being a member of Parliament if one 
was still sensitive to an intimation on the part of 
such a functionary that one ought already to have 
begun to dress. Chayter s words meant that Mr. 
Carteret would expect to have a little comfortable 
conversation with him before dinner. Nick s 
usual rapidity in dressing was, however, quite 
adequate to the occasion, and his host had not 
appeared when he went down. There were flow 
ers in* the unfeminine saloon, which contained 



 321 

several paintings, in addition to the engravings 
of pictures of animals ; but nothing could pre 
vent its reminding Nick of a comfortable com 
mittee-room. 

Mr. Carteret presently came in, with his gold- 
headed stick, a laugh like a series of little warn 
ing coughs and the air of embarrassment that 
our young man always perceived in him at first. 
He was nearly eighty, but he was still shy he 
laughed a great deal, faintly and vaguely, at no 
thing, as if to make up for the seriousness with 
which he took some jokes. He always began by 
looking away from his interlocutor, and it was 
only little by little that his eyes came round ; 
after which their limpid and benevolent blue 
made you wonder why they should ever be cir 
cumspect. He was clean shaven and had a long 
upper lip. When he had seated himself he talked 
of "majorities," and showed a disposition to con 
verse on the general subject of the fluctuation of 
Liberal gains. He had an extraordinary memory 
for facts of this sort, and could mention the fig 
ures reUting to elections in innumerable places 
in particular years. To many of these facts he 
attached great importance, in his simple, kindly, 
presupposing way ; returning five minutes later 
and correcting himself if he had said that some 
one, in 1857, had had 6014 instead of 6004. , 

Nick always felt a great hypocrite as he lis 
tened to him, in spite of the old man s courtesy 
a thing so charming in itself that it would have 



322  

been grossness to speak of him as a bore. The 

difficulty was that he took for granted all kinds 
of positive assent, and Nick, in his company, 
found himself immersed in an atmosphere of 
tacit pledges which constituted the very medium 
of intercourse and yet made him draw his breath 
a little in pain when, for a moment, he measured 
them. There would have been no hypocrisy at 
all if he could have regarded Mr. Carteret as a 
mere sweet spectacle, the last, or almost the last, 
illustration of a departing tradition of manners. 
But he represented something more than man 
ners ; he represented what he believed to be mor 
als and ideas ideas as regards which he took 
your .personal deference (not discovering how 
natural that was) for participation. Nick liked 
to think that his father, though ten years younger, 
had found it congruous to make his best friend 
of the owner of so nice a nature : it gave a soft 
ness to his feeling for that memory to be re 
minded that Sir Nicholas had been of the same 
general type a type so pure, so disinterested, 
so anxious about the public good. Just so it en 
deared Mr. Carteret to him to perceive that he 
considered his father had done a definite work, 
prematurely interrupted, which had been an ab 
solute benefit to the people of England. The 
oddity was, however, that though both Mr. Car 
teret s aspect and his appreciation were still so 
fresh, this relation of his to his late distinguished 
friend made the latter appear to Nick even more 



 323 

irrecoverably dead. The good old man had al 
most a vocabulary of his own, made up of old- 
fashioned political phrases and quite untainted 
with the new terms, mostly borrowed from 
America ; indeed, his language and his tone 
made those of almost any one who might be talk 
ing with him appear by contrast rather American. 
He was, at least nowadays, never severe nor de 
nunciatory ; but sometimes, in telling an anec 
dote, he dropped such an expression as " the 
rascal said to me," or such an epithet as " the 
vulgar dog." 

Nick was always struck with the rare sim 
plicity (it came out in his countenance) of one 
who had lived so long and seen so much of affairs 
that draw forth the passions and perversities of 
men. It often made him say to himself that Mr. 
Carteret must have been very remarkable to 
achieve with his means so many things requiring 
cleverness. It was as if experience, though com 
ing to him in abundance, had dealt with him with 
such clean hands as to leave no stain, and had 
never provoked him to any general reflection. 

;He had never proceeded in any ironic way from 
the particular to the general ; certainly he had 
never made a reflection upon anything so unpar 
liamentary as Life. He would have questioned 
the taste of such an obtrusion, and if he had en 
countered ft on the part of another would have 
regarded it as a kind of French toy, with the 
uses of which he was unacquainted. Life, for 



324  

him, was a purely practical function, not a ques 
tion of phrasing. It must be added that he had, 
to Nick s perception, his variations his back 
windows opening into grounds more private. 
That was visible from the way his eye grew cold 
and his whole polite face rather austere when he 
listened to something that he didn t agree with 
or perhaps even understand ; as if his modesty 
did not in strictness forbid the suspicion that a 
thing he did n t understand would have a proba 
bility against it. At such times there was some 
thing a little deadly in the silence in which he 
simply waited, with a lapse in his face, without 
helping his interlocutor out. Nick would have 
been very sorry to attempt to communicate to 
him a matter which he probably would not under 
stand. This cut off, of course, a multitude of 
subjects. 

The evening passed exactly as Nick had fore 
seen, even to the rather early dispersal of the 
guests, two of whom were " local " men, earnest 
and distinct, though not particularly distin 
guished. The third was a young, slim, uniniti 
ated gentleman whom Lord Bottomley brought 
with him and concerning whom Nick was in 
formed beforehand that he was engaged to be 
married to the Honorable Jane, his lordship s 
second daughter. There were recurrent allu 
sions to Nick s victory, as to which he had the 
fear that he might appear to exhibit less interest 
in it than the company did. He took energetic 



THE TRAGIC / MUSE. 3 2 5 

precautions against this and felt, repeatedly, a 
little spent with them, for the subject always 
came up once more. Yet it was not as his but 
as theirs that they liked the triumph. Mr. Car- 
teret took leave of him for the night directly after 
the other guests had gone, using at this moment 
the words that he had often used before : 

" You may sit up to any hour you like. I only 
ask that you don t read in bed." 



XVII. 

NICK S little visit was to terminate immediately 
after luncheon the following day : much as the 
old man enjoyed his being there he would not 
have dreamed of asking for more of his time, now 
that it had such great public uses. He liked in 
finitely better that his young friend should be oc 
cupied with parliamentary work than only occu 
pied in talking about it with him. Talk about it, 
however, was the next best thing, as, on the mor 
row, after breakfast, Mr. Carteret showed Nick 
that he considered. They sat in the garden, the 
morning being warm, and the old man had a table 
beside him, covered with the letters and newspa 
pers that the post had brought. He was proud 
of his correspondence, which was altogether on 
public affairs, and proud, in a manner, of the fact 
that he now dictated almost everything. That 
had more in it of the statesman in retirement, a 
character indeed not consciously assumed by Mr. 
Carteret, but always tacitly attributed to him by 
Nick, who took it rather from the pictorial point 
of view : remembering, on each occasion, only af 
terwards that though he was in retirement he had 
not exactly been a statesman. A young man, a 
very sharp, handy young man, came every morning 



 327 

at ten o clock and wrote for him till lunch-time. 
The young man had a holiday to-day, in honor of 
Nick s visit a fact the mention of which led 
Nick to make some not particularly sincere speech 
about his being ready to write anything if Mr. 
Carteret were at all pressed. 

" Ah, but your own budget : what will become 
of that ? " the old gentleman objected, glancing at 
Nick s pockets as if he was rather surprised not 
to .see them stuffed out with documents in split 
envelopes. His visitor had to confess that he 
had not directed his letters to meet him at Beau- 
clere : he should find them in town that afternoon. 
This led to a little homily from Mr. Carteret 
which made him feel rather guilty ; there was 
such an implication of neglected duty in the way 
the old man said, "You won t do them justice 
you won t do them justice." He talked for ten 
minutes, in his rich, simple, urbane way, about 
the fatal consequences of getting behind. It was 
his favorite doctrine that one should always be a 
little before ; and his own eminently regular res 
piration seemed to illustrate the idea. A man 
was certainly before who had so much in his rear. 

This led to the bestowal of a good deal of gen 
eral advice as to the mistakes to avoid at the be 
ginning of a parliamentary career ; as to which 
Mr. Carteret spoke with the experience of one 
who had sat for fifty years in the House of Com 
mons. Nick was amused, but also mystified and 
even a little irritated, by his talk : it was founded 



328 THE TRAGIC MUSh. 

on the idea of observation, and yet Nick was un 
able to regard Mr. Carteret as an observer. " He 
doesn t observe me" he said to himself; "if he 
did he would see, he wouldn t think" And 
the end of this private cogitation was a vague im- 
patience of all the things his venerable host took 
for granted. He did n t see any of the things 
that Nick saw. Some of these latter were the 
light touches that the summer morning scattered 
through the sweet old garden. The time passed 
there a good deal as if it were sitting still, with a 
plaid under its feet, while Mr. Carteret distilled a 
little more of the wisdom that he had drawn from 
his fifty years. This immense term had some 
thing fabulous and monstrous for Nick, who won 
dered whether it were the sort of thing his com 
panion supposed he had gone in for. It was not 
strange Mr. Carteret should be different ; he 
might originally have been more to himself 
Nick was not obliged to phrase it : what our 
young man meant was, more of what it was percep 
tible to him that his host was not. Should even 
he, Nick, be like that at the end of fifty years ? 
What Mr. Carteret was so good as to expect for 
him was that he should be much more distin 
guished ; and would n t this exactly mean much 
more like that ? Of course Nick heard some 
things that he had heard before ; as for instance 
the circumstances that had originally led the old 
man to settle at Beauclere. He had been re 
turned for that locality (it was his second seat), 



 329 

in years far remote, and had come to live there 
because he then had a conscientious conviction 
(modified indeed by later experience) that a mem 
ber should be constantly resident. He spoke of 
this now, smiling rosily, as he might have spoken 
of some wild aberration of his youth ; yet he 
called Nick s attention to the fact that he still so 
far clung to his conviction as to hold (though of 
what might be urged on the other side he was 
perfectly aware) that a representative should at 
least be as resident as possible. This gave Nick 
an opening for saying something that had been 
on and off his lips all the morning. 

" According to that I ought to take up my 
abode at Harsh." 

"In the measure of the convenient I should 
not be sorry to see you do it." 

" It ought to be rather convenient," Nick re 
plied, smiling. " I ve got a piece of news for you 
which I ve kept, as one keeps that sort of thing 
(for it s very good), till the last." He waited a 
little, to see if Mr. Carteret would guess, and at 
first he thought nothing would come of this. But 
after resting his young-looking eyes on him for a 
moment the old man said 

" I should indeed be very happy to hear that 
you have arranged to take a wife." 

" Mrs. Dallow has been so good as to say that 
she will marry me," Nick went on. 

" That s very suitable. I should think it 
would answer." 



33O  

" It s very jolly," said Nick. It was well that 
Mr. Carteret was not what his guest called obser 
vant, or he might have thought there was less 
gayety in the sound of this sentence than in the 
sense. 

" Your dear father would have liked it." 

" So my mother says." 

" And she must be delighted." 

" Mrs. Dallow, do you mean ? " Nick asked. 

" I was thinking of your mother. But I don t 
exclude the charming lady. I remember her as 
a little girl. I must have seen her at Windrush. 
Now I understand the zeal and amiability with 
which she threw herself into your canvass." 

" It was her they elected," said Nick. 

" I don t know that I have ever been an enthu 
siast for political women, but there is no doubt 
that, in approaching the mass of electors, a 
graceful, affable manner, the manner of the real 
English lady, is a force not to be despised." 

" Mrs. Dallow is a real English lady, and at the 
same time she s a very political woman," Nick 
remarked. 

" Is n t it rather in the family ? I remember 
once going to see her mother in town and finding 
the leaders of both parties sitting with her." 

" My principal friend, of the others, is her 
brother Peter. I don t think he troubles himself 
much about that sort of thing." 

"What does he trouble himself about?" Mr. 
Carteret inquired, with a certain gravity. 



 331 

"He s in the diplomatic service ; he s a secre 
tary in Paris." 

" That may be serious," said the old man. 

" He takes a great interest in the theatre ; I 
suppose you 11 say that may be serious too," Nick 
added, laughing. 

" Oh ! " exclaimed Mr. Carteret, looking as if 
he scarcely understood. Then he continued, 
" Well, it can t hurt you." 

" It can t hurt me ? " 

"If Mrs. Dallow takes an interest in your in 
terests." 

" When a man s in my situation he feels as if 
nothing could hurt him." 

" I m very glad you re happy," said Mr. Car 
teret. He rested his mild eyes on our young 
man, who had a sense of seeing in them, for a 
moment, the faint ghost of an old story, the dim 
revival of a sentiment that had become the mem 
ory of a memory. This glimmer of wonder and 
envy, the revelation of a life intensely celibate, 
was for an instant infinitely touching. Nick had 
always had a theory, suggested by a vague allu 
sion from his father, who had been discreet, that 
their benevolent friend had had, in his youth, an 
unhappy love-affair which had led him to forswear 
forever the commerce of woman. What re 
mained in him of conscious renunciation gave a 
throb as he looked at his bright companion, who 
proposed to take the matter so much the other 
way. " It s good to marry, and I think hVs right. 



332  

I ve not done right, I know it. If she s a good 
woman it s the best thing," Mr. Carteretwent on. 
" It s what I ve been hoping for you. Sometimes 
I ve thought of speaking to you." 

" She s a very good woman," said Nick. 

"And I hope she s not poor." Mr. Carteret 
spoke with exactly the same blandness. 

" No, indeed, she s rich. Her husband, whom 
I knew and liked, left her a large fortune." 

" And on what terms does she enjoy it ?" 

" I have n t the least idea," said Nick. 

Mr. Carteret was silent a moment. " I see. It 
doesn t concern you. It needn t concern you," 
he added in a moment. 

Nick thought of his mother, at this, but he re 
marked : " I dare say she can do what she likes 
with her money." 

" So can I, my dear young friend," said Mr. 
Carteret. 

Nick tried not to look conscious, for he felt a 
significance in the old man s face. He turned his 
own everywhere but towards it, thinking again of 
his mother. " That must be very pleasant, if one 
has any." 

" I wish you had a little more." 

" I don t particularly care," said Nick. 

" Your marriage will assist you ; you can t help 
that," Mr. Carteret went on. "But I should like 
you to be under obligations not quite so heavy." 

" Oh, I m so obliged to her for caring for 
me!" 



 333 

"That the rest does n t count ? Certainly it s 
nice of her to like you. But why should n t she ? 
Other people do." 

" Some of them make me feel as if I abused it," 
said Nick, looking at his host. " That is, they 
don t make me, but I feel it," he added, correct 
ing himself. 

" I have no son," said Mr. Carteret. " Sha n t 
you be very kind to her ? " he pursued. " You 11 
gratify her ambition." 

" Oh, she thinks me cleverer than I am." 

" That s because she s in love," hinted the old 
gentleman, as if this were very subtle. " How 
ever, you must be as clever as we think you. If 
you don t prove so " And he paused, with his 
folded hands. 

" Well, if I don t ? " asked Nick. 

"Oh, it won t do it won t do," said Mr. Car 
teret, in a tone his companion was destined to re 
member afterwards. " I say I have no son," he 
continued ; " but if I had had one he should have 
risen high." 

" It s well for me such a person does n t exist. 
I should n t easily have found a wife." 

" He should have gone to the altar with a little 
money in his pocket." 

" That would have been the least of his advan 
tages, sir." 

" When are you to be married ? " Mr. Carteret 
asked. 

" Ah, that s the question. Mrs. Dallow won t 
say." 



334  

" Well, you may consider that when it comes 
off I will make you a settlement." 

" I feel your kindness more than I can say," 
Nick replied ; " but that will probably be the 
moment when I shall be least conscious of want 
ing anything." 

" You 11 appreciate it later you 11 appreciate 
it very soon. T shall like you to appreciate it," 
Mr. Carteret went on, as if he had a just vision 
of the way a young man of a proper spirit should 
feel. Then he added, " Your father would have 
liked you to appreciate it." 

" Poor father ! " Nick exclaimed vaguely, rather 
embarrassed, reflecting on the oddity of a position 
in which the ground for holding up his head as 
the husband of a rich woman would be that he 
had accepted a present of money from another 
source. It was plain that he was not fated to go 
in for independence ; the most that he could treat 
himself to would be dependence that was duly 
grateful. " How much do you expect of me ? " 
he pursued, with a grave face. 

" It s only what your father did. He so often 
spoke of you, I remember, at the last, just after 
you had been with him alone you know I saw 
him then. He was greatly moved by his inter 
view with you, and so was I by what he told me 
of it. He said he should live on in you he 
should work in you. It has always given me a 
very peculiar feeling, if I may use the expression, 
about you." 



 335 

" The feelings are indeed peculiar, dear Mr. 
Carteret, which take so munificent a form. But 
you do oh, you do expect too much." 

" I expect you to repay me ! " said the old 
man gayly. " As for the form, I have it in my 
mind." 

" The form of repayment ? " 

"No, no of settlement." 

" Ah, don t talk of it now," said Nick, "for, 
you see, nothing else is settled. No one has 
been told except my mother. She has only con 
sented to my telling you." 

" Lady Agnes, do you mean ? " 

"Ah, no; dear ..mother would like to publish it 
on the house-tops. She s so glad she wants 
us to have it over to-morrow. But Julia wishes 
to wait. Therefore kindly mention it for the 
present to no one." 

" My dear boy, at this rate there is nothing to 
mention. What does Julia want to wait for ? " 

" Till I like her better that s what she 
says." 

" It s the way to make you like her worse. 
Has n t she your affection ? " 

" So much so that her delay makes me exceed 
ingly unhappy." 

Mr. Carteret looked at his young friend as if 
he did n t strike him as very unhappy ; but he 
demanded : "Then what more does she want ? " 
Nick laughed out at this, but he perceived his 
host had not meant it as an epigram ; while the 



336  

latter went on : " I don t understand. You re 
engaged or you re not engaged." 

" She is, but I am not. That s what she says 
about it. The trouble is she does n t believe in 
me." 

" Does n t she love you, then ? " 

"That s what I ask her. Her answer is that 
she loves me only too well. She s so afraid of 
being a burden to me that she gives me my 
freedom till I ve taken another year to think." 

" I like the way you talk about other years ! " 
Mr. Carteret exclaimed. " You had better do it 
while I m here to bless you." 

" She thinks I proposed to he/ because she got 
me in for Harsh," said Nick. 

" Well, I m sure it would be a very pretty re 
turn." 

"Ah, she doesn t believe in me," Nick mur 
mured. 

"Then I don t believe in her." 

"Don t say that-- don t say that. She s a 
very rare creature. But she s proud, shy, sus 
picious." 

" Suspicious of what ? " 

" Of everything. She thinks I m not per 
sistent." 

" Persistent ? " 

" She can t believe I shall arrive at true em 
inence." 

" A good wife should believe what her husband 
believes," said Mr. Carteret. 



TH& TRAGIC MUSE. 337 

" Ah, unfortunately I don t believe it, either." 

Mr. Carteret looked serious. " Your dear fa 
ther did." 

" I think of that I think of that," Nick re 
plied. " Certainly it will help me. If I say we re 
engaged," he went on, " it s because I consider 
it so. She gives me my liberty, but I don t 
take it." 

" Does she expect you to take back your 

word ? " 

" That s what I ask her. She never will. 
Therefore we re as good as tied." 

" I don t like it," said Mr. Carteret, after a mo 
ment. " I don t like ambiguous, uncertain situa 
tions. They please me much better when they 
are definite and clear." The retreat of expression 
had been sounded in his face the aspect it 
wore when he wished not to be encouraging. 
But after an instant he added, in a tone softer 
than this, " Don t disappoint me, my dear boy." 

" Disappoint you ? " 

" I vo told you what I want to do for you. See 
that the conditions come about promptly in which 
I may do it. Are you sure that you do every 
thing to satisfy Mrs. Dallow ? " Mr. Carteret con 
tinued. 

" I think I m very nice to her," Nick pro 
tested. " But she s so ambitious. Frankly speak- 
ing, it s a pity for her that she likes me." 

" She can t help that." 

." Possibly. But is n t it a reason for taking 



338  

me as I am ? What she wants to do is to take me 
as I may be a year hence." 

" I don t understand, if, as you say, even then 
she won t take back her word," said Mr. Car- 
teret. 

" If she does n t marry me I think she 11 never 
marry again at all." 

" What, then, does she gain by delay ? " 

"Simply this, as I make it out that she ll 
feel she has been very magnanimous. She won t 
have to reproach herself with not having given 
me a chance to change." 

" To change ? What does she think you liable 
to do?" 

Nick was silent a minute. "I don t know!" 
he said, not at all candidly. 

" Everything has altered : young people in my 
day looked at these questions more naturally," 
Mr. Carteret declared. "A woman in love has 
no need to be magnanimous. If she is, she is n t 
in love," he added shrewdly. 

"Oh, Mrs. Dallow s safe she s safe," Nick 
smiled. 

"If it were a question between you and an 
other gentleman one might comprehend. But 
what does it mean, between you and nothing ? " 

" I m much obliged to you, sir," Nick re 
turned. "The trouble is that she doesn t know 
what she has got hold of." 

" Ah, if you can t make it clear to her ! " 

" I m such a humbug," said the young man. 



 339 

His companion stared, and he continued : " I de 
ceive people without in the least intending it." 

" What on earth do you mean ? Are you de 
ceiving me ? " 

"I don t know ; it depends on what you think." 

" I think you re flighty," said Mr. Carteret, 
with the nearest approach to sternness that Nick 
had ever observed in him. " I never thought so 
before." 

" Forgive me ; it s all right. I m not frivolous ; 
that I affirm I m not." 

"You have deceived me if you are." 

" It s all right," Nick stammered, with a blush. 

" Remember your name carry it high." 

" I will as high as possible." 

"You ve no excuse. Don t tell me, after your 
speeches at Harsh ! " Nick was on the point of 
declaring again that he was a humbug, so vivid 
was his inner sense of what he thought of his fac 
titious public utterances, which had the cursed 
property of creating dreadful responsibilities and 
importunate credulities for him. If he was " cle 
ver," what fools many other people were ! He 
repressed his impulse, and Mr. Carteret pursued : 
" If, as you express it, Mrs. Dallow does n t know 
what she has got hold of, won t it clear the matter 
up a little if you inform her that the day before 
your marriage is definitely settled to take place 
you will come into something comfortable ? " 

A quick vision of what Mr. Carteret would be 
likely to regard as something comfortable flitted 



340  

before Nick, but it did not prevent him from 
replying : " Oh, I m afraid that won t do any 
good. It would make her like you better, but it 
would n t make her like me. I m afraid she won t 
care for any benefit that comes to me from an 
other hand than hers. Her affection is a very 
jealous sentiment." 

"It s a very peculiar one!" sighed Mr. Car- 
teret. " Mine s a jealous sentiment, too. How 
ever, if she takes it that way, don t tell her." 

" I 11 let you know as soon as she comes 
round," said Nick." 

"And you ll tell your mother," said Mr. Car- 
teret. " I shall like her to know." 

" It will be delightful news to her. But she s 
keen enough already." 

" I know that. I may mention now that she 
has written to me," the old man added. 

"So I suspected." 

"We have corresponded on the subject," Mr. 
Carteret continued to confess. "My view of the 
advantageous character of such an alliance has 
entirely coincided with hers." 

"It was very good-natured of you to leave me 
to speak first," said Nick. 

" I should have been disappointed if you had n t. 
I don t like all you have told me. But don t dis 
appoint me now." 

" Dear Mr. Carteret !" Nick exclaimed. 

" I won t disappoint yoii" the old man went 
on, looking at his big, old-fashioned watch. 



XVIII. 

AT first Peter Sherringham thought of asking 
to be transferred to another post and went so 
far, in London, as to take what he believed to be 
good advice on the subject. The advice perhaps 
struck him as the better for consisting of a strong 
recommendation to do nothing so foolish. Two 
or three reasons were mentioned to him why 
such a request would not, in the particular cir 
cumstances, raise him in the esteem of his supe 
riors, and he promptly recognized their force. It 
next appeared to him that it might help him (not 
with his superiors, but with himself) to apply for 
an extension of leave ; but on further reflection 
he remained convinced that though there are 
some dangers before which it is perfectly consis 
tent whh honor to flee, it was better for every 
one concerned that he should fight this especial 
battle on the spot. During his holiday his plan 
of campaign gave him plenty of occupation. He 
refurbished his arms, rubbed up his strategy, laid 
out his lines of defense. 

There was only one thing in life that his mind 
had been very much made up to, but on this 
question he had never wavered : he would get 
on, to the utmost, in his profession. It was a 



342  

point on which it was perfectly lawful to be un- 
amiable to others to be vigilant, eager, suspi 
cious, selfish. He had not, in fact, been unami- 
able to others, for his affairs had not required it : 
he had got on well enough without hardening his 
heart. Fortune had been kind to him, and he 
had passed so many competitors on the way that 
he could forswear jealousy and be generous. But 
he had always flattered himself that his hand 
would not falter on the day he should find it 
necessary to drop bitterness into his cup. This 
day would be sure to dawn, for no career was all 
clear water to the end ; and then the sacrifice 
would find him ready. His mind was familiar 
with the thought of a sacrifice : it is true that 
nothing could be plain in advance about the oc 
casion, the object, the victim. All that was tol 
erably definite was that the propitiatory offering 
would have to be some cherished enjoyment. 
Very likely, indeed, this enjoyment would be 
associated with the charms of another person 
a probability pregnant with the idea that such 
charms would have to be dashed out of sight. 
At any rate, it never had occurred to Sherring- 
harn that he himself might be the sacrifice. You 
had to pay, to get on ; but at least you borrowed 
from others to do it. When you couldn t borrow 
you did n t get on : for what was the situation in 
life in which you met the whole requisition your 
self ? 

Least of all had it occurred to our friend that 



, 343 

the wrench might come through his interest in 
that branch of art on which Nick Dormer had 
rallied him. The beauty of a love of the theatre 
was precisely that it was a passion exercised on 
the easiest terms. This was not the region of 
responsibility. It had the discredit of being 
sniffed at by the austere ; but if it was not, as 
they said, a serious field, was not the compensa 
tion just that you could not be seriously entan 
gled in it ? Sherringham s great advantage, as 
he regarded the matter, was that he had always 
kept his taste for the drama quite in its place. 
His facetious cousin was free to pretend that it 
sprawled through his life ; but this was nonsense, 
as any unprejudiced observer of that life would 
unhesitatingly attest. There had not been the 
least sprawling, and his fancy for the art of Gar- 
rick had never worn the proportions of an eccen 
tricity. It had never drawn down from above 
anything approaching a reprimand, a remon 
strance, a remark. Sherringham was positively 
proud of his discretion ; for he was a little proud 
of what he did know about the stage. Trifling 
for trifling, there were plenty of his fellows who 
had in their lives private infatuations much sillier 
and less confessable. Had he not known men 
who collected old invitation-cards (hungry for 
those of the last century), and others who had a 
J secret passion for shuffleboard ? His little weak- 
! nesses were intellectual they were a part of the 
life of the mind. All the same, on the day they 



344  

showed a symptom of interfering they should be 
plucked off with a turn of the wrist. 

Sherringham scented interference now, and 
interference in rather an invidious form. It 
might be a bore, from the point of view of the 
profession, to find one s self, as a critic of the 
stage, in love with a coquine ; but it was a much 
greater bore to find one s self in love with a 
young woman whose character remained to be 
estimated. Miriam Rooth was neither fish nor 
flesh : one had with her neither the guarantees 
of one s own class nor the immunities of hers. 
What was hers, if one came to that ? A certain 
puzzlement about this very point was part of the 
fascination which she had ended by throwing 
over him. Poor Sherringham s scheme for get 
ting on had contained no proviso against falling 
in love, but it had embodied an important clause 
on the subject of surprises. It was always a sur 
prise to fall in love, especially if one were look 
ing out for it ; so this contingency had not been 
worth official paper. But it became a man who 
respected the service he had undertaken for the 
state to be on his guard against predicaments 
from which the only issue was the rigor of matri 
mony. An ambitious diplomatist would probably 
be wise to marry, but only with his eyes very 
much open. That was the fatal surprise to be 
led to the altar in a dream. Sherringham s view 
of the proprieties attached to such a step was 
high and strict ; and if he held that a man in his 



 345 

position was, especially as the position improved, 
essentially a representative of the greatness of 
his country, he considered that the wife of such 
a personage would exercise in her degree (for in 
stance, at a foreign court) a function no less sym 
bolic. She would always be, in short, a very im 
portant quantity, and the scene was strewn with 
illustrations of this general truth. She might be 
such a help and she might be such a blight that 
common prudence required that one should test 
her in advance. Sherringham had seen women, 
in the career, who were stupid or vulgar, make a 
mess of things it was enough to wring your 
heart. Then he had his positive idea of the per 
fect ambassadress, the full-blown lily of the fu 
ture ; and with this idea Miriam Rooth presented 
no analogy whatever. 

The girl had described herself, with character 
istic directness, as " all right ; " and so she might 
be, so she assuredly was : only all right for what ? 
He had divined that she was not sentimental 
that whatever capacity she might have for re- 
spondirg to a devotion, *br for desiring it was at 
any rate not in the direction of vague philander 
ing. With him certainly she had no disposition 
to philander. Sherringham was almost afraid to 
think of this, lest it should beget in him a rage 
convertible mainly into caring for her more. 
Rage or no rage, it would be charming to be in 
love with her if there were no complications ; but 
the complications were, in advance, just what was 



346  

clearest in the business. He was perhaps cold 
blooded to think of them ; but it must be remem 
bered that they were the particular thing which 
his training had equipped him for dealing with. 
He was, at all events, not too cold-blooded to 
have, for the two months of his holiday, very lit 
tle inner vision of anything more abstract than 
Miriam s face. The desire to see it again was as 
pressing as thirst ; but he tried to teach himself 
the endurance of the traveler in the desert. He 
kept the Channel between them, but his spirit 
moved every day an inch nearer to her, until (and 
it was not long) there were no more inches left. 
The last thing he expected the future ambassa 
dress to have been was a fille de theatre. The 
answer to this objection was of course that Mir 
iam was not yet so much of one but that he could 
easily head her off. Then came worrying retorts 
to that, chief among which was the sense that to 
his artistic conscience heading her off would be 
simple shallowness. The poor girl had a right to 
her chance, and he should not really alter anything 
by taking it away from her; for was she not the 
artist to the tips of her tresses (the ambassadress 
never in the world), and would she not take it 
out in something else if one were to make her de 
viate ? So certain was that irrepressible deviltry 
to insist ever on its own. 

Besides, could one make her deviate ? If she 
had no disposition to philander, what was his 
warrant for supposing that she could be cor- 



 347 

rupted into respectability ? How could the career 
(his career) speak to a nature which had glimpses, 
as vivid as they were crude, of such a different 
range, and for which success meant quite another 
sauce to the dish ? Would the brilliancy of mar 
rying Peter Sherringham be such a bribe to relin- 
quishment ? How could he think so without 
fatuity how could he regard himself as a high 
prize ? Relinquishment of the opportunity to ex 
ercise a rare talent was not, in the nature of things, 
an easy effort to a young lady who was conceited 
as well as ambitious. Besides, she might eat her 
cake and have it might make her fortune both 
on the stage and in the world. Successful ac 
tresses had ended by marrying dukes, and was 
not that better than remaining obscure and mar 
rying a commoner ? There were moments when 
Sherringham tried to think that Miriam s talent 
was not a force to reckon with ; there was so lit 
tle to show for it as yet that the caprice of believ 
ing in it would perhaps suddenly leave her. But 
his suspicion that it was real was too uneasy to 
make such an experiment peaceful, and he came 
back, moreover, to his deepest impression that 
of her being of the turn of mind for which the 
only consistency is talent. Had not Madame 
Carre said at the last that she could "do any 
thing " ? It was true that if Madame Carre had 
been mistaken in the first place she might also be 
mistaken in the second. But in this latter case 
she would be mistaken with him, and such an 
error would be too like a truth. 



348  

I ought possibly to hesitate to say how much 
Sherringham felt the discomfort, for him, of the 
advantage that Miriam had of him the advan 
tage of her presenting herself in a light which 
rendered any passion that he might entertain an 
implication of duty as well as of pleasure. Why 
there should be this implication was more than 
he could say ; sometimes he declared to himself 
that he was superstitious for seeing it. He 
did n t know, he could scarcely conceive, of 
another case, of the same general type, in which 
he would have seen it. In foreign countries 
there were very few ladies of Miss Rooth s in 
tended profession who would not have regarded 
it as too strong an order that, to console them for 
not being admitted into drawing-rooms they 
should have no offset but the exercise of a virtue 
in which no one would believe. Because, in for 
eign countries actresses were not admitted into 
drawing-rooms : that was a pure English droll 
ery, ministering equally little to histrionics and to 
the tone of these resorts. Did the sanctity which 
to his imagination made it a burden to have to 
reckon with Miriam come from her being English ? 
Sherringham could remember cases in which 
that privilege operated as little as possible as a 
restriction. It came a great deal from Mrs. 
Rooth, in whom he apprehended depths of calcu 
lation as to what she might achieve for her 
daughter by "working" the idea of a blameless 
life. Her romantic turn of mind would not in 



 349 

the least prevent her from regarding that idea as 
a substantial capital, to be laid out to the best 
worldly advantage. Miriam s essential irreverence 
was capable, on a pretext, of making mince-meat 
of it that he was sure of ; for the only capital 
she recognized was the talent which some day 
managers and agents would outbid each other in 
paying for. But she was a good-natured creature ; 
she was fond of her mother, would do anything 
to oblige (that might work in all sorts of ways), 
and would probably like the loose slippers of 
blamelessness quite as well as the high standards 
of the opposite camp. 

Sherringham, I may add, had no desire that 
she should indulge a different preference : it was 
foreign to him to compute the probabilities of a 
young lady s misbehaving for his advantage (that 
seemed to him definitely base), and he would 
have thought himself a blackguard if, professing 
a tenderness for Miriam, he had not wished the 
thing that was best for her. The thing that was 
best for her would no doubt be to become the 
wife of the man to whose suit she should incline 
her ear. That this would be the best thing for 
the gentleman in question was, however, a very 
different matter, and Sherringham s final convic 
tion was that it would never do for him to act the 
part of that hypothetic personage. He asked for 
no removal and no extension of leave, and he 
proved to himself how well he knew what he 
was about by never addressing a line, during his 



35O  

absence, to the Hotel de la Garonne. He would 
simply go straight, and inflict as little injury upon 
Peter Sherringham as upon any one else. He 
remained away to the last hour of his privilege 
and continued to act lucidly in having nothing to 
do with the mother and daughter for several days 
after his return to Paris. 

It was when this discipline came to an end, 
one afternoon, after a week had passed, that he 
felt most the force of the reference that has just 
been made to Mrs. Rooth s private reckonings. 
He found her at home, alone, writing a letter 
under the lamp, and as soon as he came in she 
cried out that he was the very person to whom 
the letter was addressed. She could bear it no 
longer ; she had permitted herself to reproach 
him with his terrible silence to ask why he had 
quite forsaken them. It was an illustration of 
the way in which her visitor had come to regard 
her that he rather disbelieved than believed this 
description of the crumpled papers lying on the 
table. He was not sure even that he believed 
that Miriam had just gone out. He told her 
mother how busy he had been all the while he 
was away and how much time, in particular, he 
had had to give, in London, to seeing on her 
daughter s behalf the people connected with the 
theatres. 

" Ah, if you pity me, tell me that you ve got 
her an engagement ! " Mrs. Rooth cried, clasp 
ing her hands. 



 35 I 

" I took a great deal of trouble ; I wrote ever 
so many notes, sought introductions, talked with 
people such impossible people, some of them. 
In short I knocked at every door, I went into 
the question exhaustively." And he enumerated 
the things he had done, imparted some of the 
knowledge he had gathered. The difficulties were 
immense, and even with the influence he could 
command (such as it was) there was very little 
to be achieved in face of them. Still, he had 
gained ground : there were two or three fellows, 
men with small theatres, who had listened to him 
better than the others, and there was one in par 
ticular whom he had a hope he really might have 
interested. From him he had extracted certain 
benevolent assurances : he would see Miriam, he 
would listen to her, he would do for her what he 
could. The trouble was that no one would lift a 
finger for a girl unless she were known, and yet 
that she never could become known until in 
numerable fingers were lifted. You could n t go 
into the water unless you could swim, and you 
could n t swim until you had been in the water. 

" But new performers appear ; they get thea 
tres, they get audiences, they get notices in the 
newspapers," Mrs. Rooth objected. " I know of 
these things only what Miriam tells me. It s no 
knowledge that I was born to." 

" It s perfectly true ; it s all done with 
money." 

"And how do they come by money?" Mrs. 
Rooth asked, candidly. 



352  

" When they re women people give it to 
them." 

" Well, what people, now ? " 

" People who believe in them." 

" As you believe in Miriam ? " 

Sherringham was silent a moment. " No, rather 
differently. A poor man does n t believe anything 
in the same way that a rich man does." 

" Ah, don t call yourself poor ! " groaned Mrs. 
Rooth. 

" What good would it do me to be rich ? " 

" Why, you could take a theatre ; you could do 
it all yourself." 

" And what good would that do me ? " . 

"Why, don t you delight in her genius?" de 
manded Mrs. Rooth. 

" I delight in her mother. You think me more 
disinterested than I am," Sherringham added, 
with a certain soreness of irritation. 

" I know why you did n t write ! " Mrs. Rooth 
declared, archly. 

" You must go to London," Peter said, without 
heeding this remark. 

" Ah, if we could only get there it would be a 
relief. I should draw a long breath. There, at 
least, I know where I am, and what people are. 
But here one lives on hollow ground ! " 

"The sooner you get away the better," Sher 
ringham went on. 

" I know why you say that." 

"It s just what I m explaining." 



 353 

" I could n t have held out if I had n t been so 
sure of Miriam," said Mrs. Rooth. 

"Well, you need n t hold out any longer." 

" Don t you trust her ? " asked Sherringham s 
hostess. 

"Trust her?" 

" You don t trust yourself. That s why you 
were silent, why we might have thought you were 
dead, why we might have perished ourselves." 

" I don t think I understand you ; I don t know 
what you re talking about," Sherringham said. 
" But it does n t matter." 

" Does n t it ? Let yourself go ; why should 
you struggle ? " the old woman inquired. 

Her unexpected insistence annoyed her visitor, 
and he was silent again, looking at her, on the 
point of telling her that he did n t like her tone. 
But he had his tongue under such control that 
he was able presently to say, instead of this 
and it was a relief to him to give audible voice to 
the reflection : " It s a great mistake, either way, 
for a man to be in love with an actress. Either 
it means nothing serious, and what s the use of 
that ? or it means everything, and that s still 
more delusive." 

" Delusive ? " 

" Idle, unprofitable." 

" Surely, a pure affection is its own reward," 
Mrs. Rooth rejoined, with soft reasonableness. 

" In such a case how can it be pure ? " 

" I thought you were talking of an English 
gentleman," said Mrs. Rooth. 



354  

" Call the poor fellow whatever you like : a 
man with his life to lead, his way to make, his 
work, his duties, his career, to attend to. If it 
means nothing, as I say, the thing it means least 
of all is marriage." 

" Oh, my own Miriam ! " murmured Mrs. 
Rooth. 

"On the other hand, fancy the complication 
if such a man marries a woman who is on the 
stage." 

Mrs. Rooth looked as if she were trying to fol 
low. " Miriam is n t on the stage yet." 

" Go to London, and she soon will be." 

" Yes, and then you 11 have your excuse." 

" My excuse ? " 

" For deserting us altogether." 

Sherringham broke into laughter at this, the 
tone was so droll. Then he rejoined, " Show me 
some good acting and I won t desert you." 

" Good acting ? Ah, what is the best acting 
compared with the position of an English lady ? 
If you 11 take her as she is, you may have her," 
Mrs. Rooth suddenly added. 

"As she is, with all her ambitions unas- 
suaged ? " 

"To marry you might not that be an ambi 
tion ? " 

"A very paltry one. Don t answer for her, 
don t attempt that," said Sherringham. "You 
can do much better." 

" Do you think you can ? " smiled Mrs. Rooth. 



 355 

" I don t want to ; I only want to let it alone. 
She s an artist ; you must give her her head," 
Peter went on. " You must always give an artist 
his head." 

" But I have known great ladies who were 
artists. In English society there is always a 
field." 

" Don t talk to me of English society ! Thank 
heaven, in the first place, I don t live in it. Do 
you want her to give up her genius ? " 

" I thought you did n t care for it." 

" She d say, No, I thank you, dear mamma. " 

" My gifted child ! " Mrs. Rooth murmured. 

" Have you ever proposed it to her ? " 

" Proposed it ? " 

"That she should give up trying." 

Mrs. Rooth hesitated, looking down. " Not 
for the reason you mean. We don t talk about 
love," she simpered. 

" Then it s so much less time wasted. Don t 
stretch out your hand to the worse when it may 
some cay grasp the better," Sherringham pur 
sued. Mrs. Rooth raised her eyes at him, as if 
she recognized the force there might be in that, 
and he added : " Let her blaze out, let her look 
about her. Then you may talk to me if you 
like." 

" It s very puzzling," the old woman remarked, 
artlessly. 

Sherringham laughed again ; then he said, 
" Now don t tell me I m not a good friend." 



356  

"You are indeed you re a very noble gen 
tleman. That s just why a quiet life with 
you " 

"It wouldn t be quiet for me ! " Sherringham 
broke in. " And that s not what Miriam was 
made for." 

" Don t say that, for my precious one ! " Mrs. 
Rooth quavered. 

"Go to London go to London," her visitor 
repeated. 

Thoughtfully, after an instant, she extended 
her hand and took from the table the letter on 
the composition of which he had found her en 
gaged. Then, with a quick movement, she tore 
it up. " That s what Mr. Dashwood says." 

" Mr. Dashwood ? " 

" I forgot you don t know him. He s the 
brother of that lady we met the day you were so 
good as to receive us ; the one who was so kind 
to us Mrs. Lovick." 

" I never heard of him." 

".Don t you remember that she spoke of him, 
and Mr. Lovick did n t seem very kind about 
him ? She told us that if he were to meet us 
and she was so good as to insinuate that it would 
be a pleasure to him to do so he might give us, 
as she said, a tip." 

Sherringham indulged in a visible effort to rec 
ollect. " Yes, he comes back to me. He s an 
actor." 

" He s a gentleman too," said Mrs. Rooth. 



, 357 

" And you ve met him, and he has given you 
a tip ? " 

" As I say, he wants us to go to London." 

" I see, but even I can tell you that." 

" Oh, yes," said Mrs. Rooth ; " but he says he 
can help us." 

" Keep hold of him, then, if he s in the busi 
ness." 

" He s a perfect gentleman," said Mrs. Rooth. 
" He s immensely struck with Miriam." 

" Better and better. Keep hold of him." 

"Well, I m glad you don t object," Mrs. Rooth 
smiled. 

"Why should I object?" 

" You don t consider us as all your own ? " 

" My own ? Why, I regard you as the public s 
the world s." 

Mrs. Rooth gave a little shudder. " There s 
a sort of chill in that. It s grand, but it s cold. 
However, I needn t hesitate, then, to tell you 
that it s with Mr. Dashwood that Miriam has 
gone out." 

" Why hesitate, gracious heaven ? " But in 
the next breath Sherringham asked : " Where has 
she gone ? " 

"You don t like it! " laughed Mrs. Rooth. 

" Why should it be a thing to be enthusiastic 
about ? " 

"Well, he s charming, and /trust him." 

" So do I," said Sherringham. 

" They ve gone to see Madame Carre." 



358  

" She has come back, then ? " 

" She was expected back last week. Miriam 
wants to show her how she has improved." 

" And has she improved ? " 

" How can I tell with my mother s heart ? " 
asked Mrs. Rooth. "I don t judge; I only wait 
and pray. But Mr. Dashwood thinks she is won 
derful." 

" That s a blessing. And when did he turn 
up ? " 

" About a fortnight ago. We met Mrs. Lovick 
at the English church, and she was so good as 
to recognize us and speak to us. She said she 
had been away, with her children, or she would 
have come to see us. She had just returned to 
Paris." 

" Yes, I ve not yet seen her," said Sherring- 
ham. " I see Lovick, but he does n t talk of his 
brother-in-law." 

" I did n t, that day, like his tone about him," 
Mrs. Rooth observed. " We walked a little way 
with Mrs. Lovick, and she asked Miriam about 
her prospects and if she were working. Miriam 
said she had no prospects." 

" That was not very nice to me," Sherringham 
interrupted. 

" But when you had left us in black darkness, 
what were our prospects ? " 

" I see ; it s all right. Go on." 

" Then Mrs. Lovick said her brother was to be 
in Paris a few days and she would tell him to 



 359 

come and see us. He arrived, she told him, and 
he came. Voila!" said Mrs. Rooth. 

" So that now (so far as he is concerned) Miss 
Rooth has prospects ? " 

" He is n t a manager, unfortunately." 

" Where does he act ? " 

" He is n t acting just now ; he has been abroad. 
He has been to Italy, I believe, and he is just 
stopping here on his way to London." 

" I see ; he is a perfect gentleman," said Sher- 
ringham. 

" Ah, you re jealous of him." 

" No, but you re trying to make me so. The 
more competitors there are for the glory of bring 
ing her out, the better for her." 

" Mr. Dashwood wants to take a theatre," said 
Mrs. Rooth. 

" Then perhaps he s our man." 

" Oh, if you d help him ! " cried Mrs. Rooth. 

"Help him?" 

" Help him to help us." 

" We 11 all work together ; it will be very jolly," 
said Sherringham gayly. " It s a sacred cause, 
the love of art, and we shall be a happy band. 
Dashwood s his name ? " he added in a moment. 
" Mrs. Lovick wasn t a Dashwood." 

" It s his nom de theatre Basil Dashwood. 
Do you like it ? " Mrs. Rooth inquired. 

" You say that as Miriam might do : her talent 
is catching." 

" She s always practicing always saying 



360  

things over and over, to seize the tone. I have 
her voice in my ears. He wants her not to have 
any." 

" Not to have any ? " 

" Any nom de theatre. He wants her to use 
her own ; he likes it so much. He says it will do 
so well you can t better it." 

" He s a capital adviser," said Sherringham, 
getting up. " I 11 come back to-morrow." 

" I won t ask you to wait till they return, they 
may be so long," Mrs. Rooth replied. 

" Will he come back with her ? " Sherringham 
inquired, smoothing his hat. 

" I hope so, at this hour. With my child in 
the streets, I tremble. We don t live in cabs, as 
you may easily suppose." 

" Did they go on foot ? " Sherringham contin 
ued. 

" Oh, yes ; they started in high spirits." 

"And is Mr. Basil Dashwood acquainted with 
Madame Carre ? " 

" Oh, no, but he longed to be introduced to 
her ; he implored Miriam to take him. Natu 
rally she wishes to oblige him. She s very nice 
to him if he can do anything." 

" Quite right ; that s the way." 

" And she also wanted him to see what she can 
do for the great critic," Mrs. Rooth added. 

"The great critic ? " 

" I mean that terrible old woman in the red 
wig." 



 361 

" That s what I should like to see too," said 
Sherringham. 

" Oh, she has gone ahead ; she is pleased with 
herself. Work, work, work, said Madame 
Carre. Well, she has worked, worked, worked. 
That s what Mr. Dashwood is pleased with even 
more than with other things." 

" What do you mean by other things ? " 

" Oh, her genius and her fine appearance." 

" He approves of her fine appearance ? I ask 
because you think he knows what will take." 

" I know why you ask," said Mrs. Rooth. 
" He says it will be worth hundreds of thousands 
to her." 

"That s the sort of thing I like to hear," 
Sherringham rejoined. " I 11 come in to-mor 
row," he repeated. 

" And shall you mind if Mr. Dashwood s 
here?" 

" Does he come every day ? " 

" Oh, they re always at it." 

"Always at it?" 

"W T hy, she acts to him every sort of thing 
and he says if it will do." 

" How many days has he been here, then ? " 

Mrs. Rooth reflected. " Oh, I don t know. 
Since he turned up they ve passed so quickly." 

" So far from minding it, I m eager to see 
him," Sherringham declared ; " and I can imagine 
nothing better than what you describe if he 
isn t an ass." 



362  

" Dear me, if he is n t clever you must tell us : 
we can t afford to be deceived ! " Mrs. Rooth ex 
claimed, innocently and plaintively. " What do 
we know how can we judge ? " she added. 

Sherringham hesitated, with his hand on the 
latch. " Oh, I 11 tell you what I think of him ! " 



XIX. 

WHEN he got into the street he looked about 
him for a cab, but he was obliged to walk some 
distance before encountering one. In this little 
interval he saw no reason to modify the determi 
nation he had formed in descending the steep 
staircase of the Hotel de la Garonne ; indeed the 
desire which prompted it only quickened his pace. 
He had an hour to spare, and he too would go to 
see Madame Carre. If Miriam and her compan 
ion had proceeded to the Rue de Constantinople 
on foot, he would probably reach the house as 
soon as they. It was all quite logical : he was 
eager to see Miriam that was natural enough ; 
and he had admitted to Mrs. Rooth that he was 
keen on the subject of Mrs. Lovick s theatrical 
brother, in whom such effective aid might per 
haps reside. To catch Miriam really revealing 
herself to the old actress (since that was her er 
rand), with the jump she believed herself to have 
taken, would be a very happy stroke, the thought 
of which made her benefactor impatient. He 
presently found his cab, and, as he bounded in, 
bade the coachman drive fast. He learned from 
Madame Carre s portress that her illustrious loca- 
taire was at home and that a lady and a gentle 
man had gone up some time before. 



364  

In the little antechamber, after he was ad- 
mitted, he heard a high voice issue from the 
salon, and, stopping a moment to listen, perceived 
that Miriam was already launched in a recitation. 
He was able to make out the words, all the more 
that before he could prevent the movement the 
maid-servant who had let him in had already 
opened the door of the room (one of the wings of 
it, there being, as in most French doors, two 
pieces), before which, within, a heavy curtain was 
suspended. Miriam was in the act of rolling out 
some speech from the English poetic drama 

" For I am sick and capable of fears, 
Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears." 

He recognized one of the great tirades of Shake 
speare s Constance, and saw she had just begun 
the magnificent scene at the beginning of the 
third act of King John, in which the passionate, 
injured mother and widow sweeps in wild organ- 
tones up and down the scale of her irony and 
wrath. The curtain concealed him and he lurked 
there for three minutes after he had motioned to 
thefemme de chambre to retire on tiptoe. The 
trio in the salon, absorbed in the performance, 
had apparently not heard his entrance or the 
opening of the door, which was covered by the 
girl s splendid declamation. Sherringham lis 
tened intently, he was so arrested by the spirit 
with which she attacked her formidable verses. 
He had needed to hear her utter but half a dozen 
of them to comprehend the long stride she had 



 365 

taken in his absence ; they told him that she had 
leaped into possession of her means. He re 
mained where he was till she arrived at 

" Then speak again ; not all thy former tale, 
But this one word, whether thy tale be true." 

This apostrophe, being briefly responded to in 
another voice, gave him time quickly to raise the 
curtain and show himself, passing into the room 
with a " Go on, go on ! " and a gesture earnestly 
deprecating a stop. 

Miriam, in the full swing of her part, paused 
but for an instant and let herself ring out again, 
while Peter sank into the nearest chair and she 
fixed him with her illumined eyes, or rather with 
those of the raving Constance. Madame Carre, 
buried in a chair, kissed her hand to him, and a 
young man who stood near the girl, giving her 
the cue, stared at him over the top of a little 
book. " Admirable magnificent ; go on," Sher- 
ringham repeated "go on to the end of the 
scene do it all ! " Miriam flushed a little, but 
he immediately discovered that she had no per 
sonal en:;otion in seeing him again ; the cold pas 
sion of art had perched on her banner and she 
listened to herself with an ear as vigilant as if 
she had been a Paganini drawing a fiddle-bow. 
This effect deepened as she went on, rising and 
rising to the great occasion, moving with extraor 
dinary ease and in the largest, clearest style on 
the dizzy ridge of her idea. That she had an 
idea was visible enough, and that the whole thing 



366  

was very different from all that Sherringham had 
hitherto heard her attempt. It belonged quite to 
another class of effort ; she seemed now like the 
finished statue, lifted from the ground to its ped 
estal. It was as if the sun of her talent had 
risen above the hills and she knew that she was 
moving, that she would always move, in its guid 
ing light. This conviction was the one artless 
thing that glimmered, like a young joy, through 
the tragic mask of Constance, and Sherringham s 
heart beat faster as he caught it in her face. It 
only made her appear more intelligent ; and yet 
there had been a time when he had thought her 
stupid ! Intelligent was the whole spirit in which 
she carried the scene, making him cry to himself, 
from point to point, "How she feels it how 
she sees it how she creates it ! " 

He looked, at moments, at Madame Carre, and 
perceived that she had an open book in her lap, 
apparently a French prose version, brought by 
her visitors, of the play ; but she never either 
glanced at him or at the volume : she only sat 
screwing into the girl her hard bright eyes, pol 
ished by experience like fine old brasses. The 
young man uttering the lines of the other speak 
ers was attentive in another degree ; he followed 
Miriam, in his own copy of the play, to be sure 
not to miss the cue ; but he was elated and ex 
pressive, was evidently even surprised ; he col 
ored and smiled, and when he extended his hand 
to assist Constance to rise, after Miriam, acting 



 $6? 

out her text, had seated herself grandly on " the 
huge, firm earth," he bowed over her as obse 
quiously as if she had been his veritable sover 
eign. He was a very good looking young man, 
tall, well proportioned, straight-featured and fair, 
of whom, manifestly, the first thing to be said, on 
any occasion, was that he looked remarkably like 
a gentleman. He carried this appearance, which 
proved inveterate and importunate, to a point 
that was almost a negation of its spirit ; that is 
it might have been a question whether it could 
be in good taste to wear any character, even that 
particular one, so much on one s sleeve. It was 
literally on his sleeve that this young man partly 
wore his own ; for it resided considerably in his 
attire, and in especial in a certain close-fitting 
dark blue frock-coat (a miracle of a fit), which 
moulded his young form just enough, and not too 
much, and constituted (as Sherringham was des 
tined to perceive later) his perpetual uniform or 
badge. It was not till later that Sherringham 
began to feel exasperated by Basil Dashwood s 
" type " (the young stranger was of course Basil 
Dashwood), and even by his blue frock-coat, the 
recurrent, unvarying, imperturbable " good form " 
of his aspect. This unprofessional air ended by 
striking the observer as the profession that he 
had adopted, and was indeed (so far as had as yet 
been indicated) his theatrical capital, his main 
qualification for the stage. 

The powerful, ample manner in which Miriam 



368  

handled her scene produced its full impression, 
the art with which she surmounted its difficulties! 
the liberality with which she met its great de 
mand upon the voice, and the variety of expres 
sion that she threw into a torrent of objurgation. 
It was a real composition, studded with passages 
that called a suppressed " Bravo ! " to the lips 
and seeming to show that a talent capable of such 
an exhibition was capable of anything. 

" But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy, 
Nature and Fortune join d to make thee great : 
Of Nature s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast, 
And with the half-blown rose." 

As Miriam turned to her imagined child with 
this exquisite apostrophe (she addressed Mr. 
Dashwood as if he were playing Arthur, and he 
lowered his book, dropped his head and his eyes 
and looked handsome and ingenuous), she opened 
at a stroke, to Sherringham s vision, a prospect 
that they would yet see her express tenderness 
better even than anything else. Her voice was 
enchanting in these lines, and the beauty of her 
performance was that while she uttered the full 
fury of the part she missed none of its poetry. 

" Where did she get hold of that where did 
she get hold of that ? " Sherringham wondered 
while his whole sense vibrated. " She had n t 
got hold of it when I went away." And the as 
surance flowed over him again that she had found 
the key to her box of treasures. In the summer, 
during their weeks of frequent meeting, she had 



 369 

only fumbled with the lock. One October day, 
while he was away, the key had slipped in, had 
fitted, or her finger at last had touched the 
right spring, and the capricious casket had flown 
open. 

It was during the present solemnity that Sher- 
ringham, excited by the way she came out and 
with a hundred startled ideas about her wheeling 
through his mind, was for the first time and most 
vividly visited by a perception that ended by 
becoming frequent with him that of the per 
fect presence of mind, unconfused, unhurried by 
emotion, that any artistic performance requires 
and that all, whatever the instrument, require in 
exactly the same degree : the application, in 
other words, clear and calculated, crystal-firm as 
it were, of the idea conceived in the glow of ex 
perience, of suffering, of joy. Sherringham after 
wards often talked of this with Miriam, who, 
however, was not able to present him with a neat 
theory of the subject. She had no knowledge 
that ic was publicly discussed ; she was only, 
practically, on the side of those who hold that at 
the moment of production the artist cannot have 
his wits too much about him. When Peter told 
her there were people who maintained that in 
such a crisis he must lose himself in the flurry, 
she stared with surprise and then broke out, 
" Ah, the idiots ! " She eventually became, in her 
judgments, in impatience and the expression of 
contempt, very free and absolutely irreverent. 



3/0  

" What a splendid scolding ! " Sherringham ex 
claimed when, on the entrance of the Pope s leg 
ate, her companion closed the book upon the 
scene. Peter pressed his lips to Madame Carre s 
finger-tips ; the old actress got up and held out 
her arms to Miriam. The girl never took her 
eyes off Sherringham while she passed into Ma 
dame Carre s embrace and remained there. They 
were full of their usual sombre fire, and it was 
always the case that they expressed too much 
anything that they expressed at all ; but they 
were not defiant nor even triumphant now they 
were only deeply explicative ; they seemed to 
say, " That s the sort of thing I meant; that s 
what I had in mind when I asked you to try to 
do something for me." Madame Carre folded 
her pupil to her bosom, holding her there as the 
old marquise in a comedie de mceurs might, in the 
last scene, have held her god-daughter the in 
genue. 

" Have you got me an engagement ? " Miriam 
asked of Sherringham. " Yes, he has done some 
thing splendid for me," she went on to Madame 
Carre, resting her hand caressingly on one of the 
actress s while the old woman discoursed with 
Mr. Dashwood, who was telling her, in very 
pretty French, that he was tremendously excited 
about Miss Rooth. Madame Carre looked at him 
as if she wondered how he appeared when he was 
calm and how, as a dramatic artist, he expressed 
that condition.

"Yes, yes, something splendid, for a begin 
ning," Sherringham answered, radiantly, reck 
lessly ; feeling now only that he would say any 
thing, do anything, to please her. He spent, on 
the spot, in imagination, his last penny. 

" It s such a pity you could n t follow it ; you 
would have liked it so much better," Mr. Dash- 
wood observed to his hostess. 

" Could n t follow it ? Do you take me for 
une sotte ? " the celebrated artist cried. " I sus 
pect I followed it de plus prh que vous, mon 
sieur ! " 

"Ah, you see the language is so awfully fine," 
Basil Dashwood replied, looking at his shoes. 

"The language? Why, she rails like a fish 
wife. Is that what you call language ? Ours is 
another business." 

" If you understood if you understood you 
would see the greatness of it," Miriam declared. 
And then, in another tone : " Such delicious ex 
pressions ! " 

" On dit que c est tres-fort. But who can tell if 
you really say it ? " Madame Carre demanded. 

" Ah, par exemple, I can ! " Sherringham ex 
claimed. 

" Oh, you you re a Frenchman." 

" Could n t he tell if he were not ? " asked 
Basil Dashwood. 

The old woman shrugged her shoulders. " He 
would n t know." 

"That s flattering to me."

" Oh, you don t you pretend to complain," 
Madame Carre said. " I prefer our imprecations 
those of Camille," she went on. " They have 
the beauty des plus belles chases." 

" I can say them too," Miriam broke in. . 

" Insolente ! " smiled Madame Carre. " Ca 
mille does n t squat down on the floor in the 
middle of them." 

" For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop. 
To me and to the state of my great grief 
Let kings assemble," 

Miriam quickly declaimed. "Ah, if you don t 
feel the way she makes a throne of it ! " 

" It J s really tremendously fine, chere madame" 
Sherringham said. "There s nothing like it." 

"Vous etes insupportables," the old woman an 
swered. " Stay with us. I 11 teach you Phedre." 

" Ah, Phaedra Phaedra ! " Basil Dashwood 
vaguely ejaculated, looking more gentlemanly 
than ever. 

" You have learned all I have taught you, but 
where the devil have you learned what I have n t 
taught you ? " Madame Carre went on. 

" I Ve worked I have ; you d call it work 
all through the bright, late summer, all through 
the hot, dull, empty days. I Ve battered down 
the door I did hear it crash one day. But I m 
not so very good yet ; I m only in the right di 
rection." 

" Malicieuse ! " murmured Madame Carre. 

" Oh, I can beat that," the girl went on. 



 373 

" Did you wake up one morning and find you 
had grown a pair of wings ? " Sherringham asked. 
" Because that s what the difference amounts to 
you really soar. Moreover, you re an angel," 
he added, charmed with her unexpectedness, the 
good-nature of her forbearance to reproach him 
for not having written to her. And it seemed to 
him, privately, that she luas angelic when, in an 
swer to this, she said, ever so blandly : 

" You know you read King John with me be 
fore you went away. I thought over immensely 
what you said. I did n t understand it much at 
the time I was so stupid. But it all came to 
me later." 

" I wish you could see yourself," Sherringham 
answered. 

" My dear fellow, I do. What do you take me 
for ? I did n t rniss a vibration of my voice, a 
fold of my robe." 

"I didn t see you looking," Sherringham re 
turned. 

" No one ever will. Do you think I would 
show it ? " 

"Ars celare artem," Basil Dashwood jocosely 
dropped. 

"You must first have the art to hide," said 
Sherringham, wondering a little why Miriam 
did n t introduce her young friend to him. She 
was, however, both then and later, perfectly neg 
lectful of such cares, never thinking or heeding 
how other people got on together. When she 



374  

found they did n t get on she laughed at them : 
that was the nearest she came to arranging for 
them. Sherringham observed, from the moment 
she felt her strength, the immense increase of 
her good-humored inattention to detail all de 
tail save that of her work, to which she was ready 
to sacrifice holocausts of feelings, when the feel 
ings were other people s. This conferred on her a 
kind of profanity, an absence of ceremony in her 
social relations which was both amusing, because 
it suggested that she would take what she gave, 
and formidable, because it was inconvenient and 
you might not care to give what she would take. 

" If you have n t got any art, it s not quite the 
same as if you did n t hide it, is it ? " asked Basil 
Dashwood. 

" That s right say one of your clever things ! " 
murmured Miriam, sweetly, to the young man. 

"You re always acting," he answered, in Eng 
lish, with a laugh, while Sherringham remained 
struck with his expressing just what he himself 
had felt weeks before. 

" And when you have shown them your fish 
wife, to your public de-la-bas, what will you do 
next? " asked Madame Carre. 

" I 11 do Juliet I 11 do Cleopatra." 

"Rather a big bill, is n t it ?" Mr. Dashwood 
volunteered to Sherringham, in a friendly, dis 



criminating manner. 



"Constance and Juliet take care you don t 
mix them," said Sherringham. 



 375 

" I want to be various. You once told me I 
had a hundred characters," Miriam replied. 

"Ah, vous-en-etes Id?" cried the old actress. 
"You may have a hundred characters, but you 
have only three plays. I m told that s all there 
are in English." 

Miriam appealed to Sherringham. " What ar 
rangements have you made ? What do the people 
want ? " 

" The people at the theatre ? " 

" I m afraid they don t want King John, and 
I don t believe they hunger for Antony and Cle 
opatra," Basil Dashwood suggested. " Ships and 
sieges and armies and pyramids, you know : we 
mustn t be too heavy." 

" Oh, I hate scenery ! " sighed Miriam. 

" Elle est superbe," said Madame Carre. " You 
must put those pieces on the stage : how will you 
do it ? " 

" Oh, we know how to get up a play in Lon 
don, Madame Carre," Basil Dashwood responded, 
genially. "They put money on it, you know." 

" On it ? But what do they put in it ? Who 
will interpret them ? Who will manage a style 
like that the style of which the verses she just 
repeated are a specimen ? Whom have you got 
that one has ever heard of ? " 

" Oh, you 11 hear of a good deal when once 
she gets started," Basil Dashwood contended, 
cheerfully. 

Madame Carre looked at him a moment ; then, 



376  

" You 11 become very bad," she said to Miriam. 
"I m glad I sha n t see it." 

" People will do things for me I 11 make 
them," the girl declared. " I 11 stir them up so 
that they ll have ideas." 

" What people, pray ? " 

" Ah, terrible woman ! " Sherringham moaned, 
theatrically. 

" We translate your pieces there will be 
plenty of parts," Basil Dashwood said. 

" Why then go out of the door to come in at 
the window ? especially if you smash it ! An 
English arrangement of a French piece is a 
pretty woman with her back turned." 

" Do you really want to keep her ? " Sherring 
ham asked of Madame Carre, as if he were think 
ing for a moment that this after all might be pos 
sible. 

She bent her strange eyes on him. " No, you 
are all too queer together ; we could n t be both 
ered with you, and you re not worth it." 

" I m glad it s together ; we can console each 
other." 

" If you only would ; but you don t seem to ! 
In short, I don t understand you I give you 
up. But it does n t matter," said the old woman, 
wearily, " for the theatre is dead and even you, 
ma toute-belle, won t bring it to life. Everything 
is going from bad to worse, and I don t care what 
becomes of you. You would n t understand us 
here and they won t understand you there, and 



 377 

everything is impossible, and no one is a whit 
the wiser, and it s not of the least consequence. 
Only when you raise your arms, lift them just 
a little higher," Madame Carre added. 

" My mother will be happier chez nous" said 
Miriam, throwing her arms straight up, with a 
noble tragic movement. 

" You won t be in the least in the right path 
till your mother s in despair." 

" Well, perhaps we can bring that about even 
in London," Sherringham suggested, laughing. 

" Dear Mrs. Rooth she s great fun," Mr. 
Dashwood dropped. 

Miriam transferred the gloomy beauty of her 
gaze to him, as if she were practicing. " You 
won t upset her, at any rate." Then -she stood, 
with her fatal mask, before Madame Carre. " I 
want to do the modern too. I want to do le 
drame, with realistic effects." 

" And do you want to look like the portico of 
the Madeleine when it s draped for a funeral ? " 
her instructress mocked. " Never, never. I 
don t believe you re various : that s not the way 
I see you. You re pure tragedy, with de grands 
effets de voix, in the great style, or you re noth 
ing." 

" Be beautiful be only that," Sherringham 
urged. " Be only what you can be so well 
something that one may turn to for a glimpse of 
perfection, to lift one out of all the vulgarities of 
the day." 



378  

Thus apostrophized, the girl broke out with 
one of the speeches of Racine s Phaedra, hushing 
her companions on the instant " You 11 be the 
English Rachel," said Basil Dashwood when she 
stopped. 

" Acting in French ! " Madame Carre ex 
claimed. " I don t believe in an English Rachel." 

" I shall have to work it out, what I shall be," 
Miriam responded, with a rich, pensive effect. 

" You re in wonderfully good form to-day," 
Sherringham said to her ; his appreciation reveal 
ing a personal subjection which he was unable 
to conceal from his companions, much as he 
wished it. 

" I really mean to do everything." 

"Very well ; after all, Garrick did." 

"Well, I shall be the Garrick of my sex." 

" There s a very clever author doing something 
for me ; I should like you to see it," said Basil 
Dashwood, addressing himself equally to Miriam 
and to her diplomatic friend. 

" Ah, if you have very clever authors ! " And 
Madame Carre spun the sound to the finest satiric 
thread. 

" I shall be very happy to see it," said Sher 
ringham. 

This response was so benevolent that Basil 
Dashwood presently began : " May I ask you at 
what theatre you have made arrangements ? " 

Sherringham looked at him a moment. " Come 
and see. me at the Embassy and I 11 tell you." 



 379 

Then he added, " I know your sister, Mrs. Lov- 
ick." 

" So I supposed : that s why I took the liberty 
of asking such a question." 

" It s no liberty ; but Mr. Sherringham does n t 
appear to be able to tell you," said Miriam. 

" Well, you know, it s a very curious world, all 
those theatrical people over there," Sherringham 
said. 

"Ah, don t say anything against them, when 
I m one of them," Basil Dashwood laughed. 

" I might plead the absence of information, as 
Miss Rooth has neglected to make us acquainted." 

Miriam smiled : " I know you both so little." 
But she presented them, with a great stately air, 
to each other, and the two men shook hands while 
Madame Carre observed them. 

" Tieus ! you gentlemen meet here for the first 
time ? You do right to become friends that s 
the best thing. Live together in peace and mu 
tual confidence. C est de beaucoup le plus sage." 

" Certainly, for yoke-fellows," said Sherring 
ham. 

He began the next moment to repeat to his 
new acquaintance some of the things he had been 
told in London ; but their hostess stopped him 
off, waving the talk away with charming over 
done stage horror and the young hands of the 
heroines of Marivaux. " Ah, wait till you go, for 
that ! Do you suppose I care for news of your 
mountebanks booths ? " 



XX. 

As many people know, there are not, in the fa 
mous Theatre Fran9ais, more than a dozen good 
seats accessible to ladies. The stalls are forbid 
den them, the boxes are a quarter of a mile from 
the stage and the balcony is a delusion save for 
a few chairs at either end of its vast horseshoe. 
But there are two excellent baignoires d avant- 
sctne, which indeed are by no means always to 
be had. It was, however, into one of them that, 
immediately after his return to Paris, Sherring- 
ham ushered Mrs. Rooth and her daughter, with 
the further escort of Basil Dashwood. He had 
chosen the evening of the reappearance of the 
celebrated Mademoiselle Voisin (she had been 
enjoying a congt of three months), an actress 
whom Miriam had seen several times before and 
for whose method she professed a high though 
somewhat critical esteem. It was only for the 
return of this charming performer that Sherring- 
ham had been waiting to respond to Miriam s 
most ardent wish that of spending an hour in 
\hefoyer des artistes of the great theatre. She 
was the person whom he knew best in the house 
of Moliere ; he could count upon her to do them 
the honors, some night when she was in the 



 381 

" bill," and make the occasion sociable. Miriam 
bad been impatient for it she was so convinced 
that her eyes would be opened in the holy of 
holies ; but wishing particularly, as he did, to 
participate in her impression, he had made her 
promise that she would not taste of this experi 
ence without him not let Madame Carre, for 
instance, take her in his absence. There were 
questions the girl wished to put to Mademoiselle 
Voisin questions which, having admired her 
from the balcony, she felt she was exactly the 
person to answer. She was more " in it " now, 
after all, than Madame Carre, in spite of her 
slenderer talent : she was younger, fresher, more 
modern and (Miriam found the word) less aca 
demic. Sherringham perfectly foresaw the day 
when his young friend would make indulgent al 
lowances for poor Madame Carre, patronizing her 
as an old woman of good intentions. 

The play, to-night, was six months old, a large, 
serious, i;uccessful comedy, by the most distin 
guished of authors, with a thesis, a chorus, em 
bodied in one character, a seine a faire and a 
part full of opportunities for Mademoiselle Voisin. 
There were things to be said about this artist, 
strictures to be dropped as to the general quality 
of her art, and Miriam leaned back now, making 
her comments as if they cost her less ; but the 
actress had knowledge and distinction and pa 
thos, and our young lady repeated several times, 
" How quiet she is, how wonderfully quiet ! 



382  

Scarcely anything moves but her face and her 
voice. Le geste rare, but really expressive when 
it comes. I like that economy ; it s the only 
way to make the gesture significant." 

" I don t admire the way she holds her arms," 
Basil Dashwood said : " like a demoiselle de 
magasin trying on a jacket." 

" Well, she holds them, at any rate. I dare say 
it s more than you do with yours." 

"Oh, yes, she holds them ; there s no mistake 
about that. I hold them, I hope, hein ? she 
seems to say to all the house." The young Eng 
lish professional laughed good-humoredly, and 
Sherringham was struck with the pleasant fa 
miliarity he had established with their brave 
companion. He was knowing and ready and he 
said, in the first entracte (they were waiting for 
the second, to go behind), amusing, perceptive 
things. " They teach them to be ladylike, and 
Voisin is always trying to show that. See how 
I walk, see how I sit, see how quiet I am and how 
I have le geste rare. Now can you say I ain t a 
lady ? She does it all as if she had a class." 

" Well, to-night I m her class," said Miriam. 

"Oh, I don t mean of actresses, but of femmes 
du monde. She shows them how to act in so 
ciety." 

" You had better take a few lessons," Miriam 
retorted. 

" You should see Voisin in society," Sherring 
ham interposed. 



 383 

" Does she go into it ? " Mrs. Rooth demanded, 
with interest. 

Sherringham hesitated. " She receives a great 
many people." 

" Why should n t they, when they re nice ? " 
Mrs. Rooth continued. 

" When the people are nice ? " Miriam asked. 

" Now don t tell me she s not what one would 
wish," said Mrs. Rooth to Sherringham. 

" It depends upon what that is," he answered, 
smiling. 

" What I should wish if she were my daugh 
ter," the old woman rejoined, blandly. 

" Ah, wish your daughter to act as well as that 
and you 11 do the handsome thing for her ! " 

" Well, she seems to feel what she says," Mrs. 
Rooth murmured, piously. 

" She has some stiff things to say. I mean 
about her past," Basil Dashwood remarked. 
" The past the dreadful past on the stage ! " 

" Wait till the end, to see how she comes out. 
We must all be merciful ! " sighed Mrs. Rooth. 

" We ve seen it before ; you know what hap 
pens," Miriam observed to her mother. 

" I ve seen so many, I get them mixed." 

" Yes, they re all in queer predicaments. Poor 
old mother what we show you ! " laughed the 
girl. 

" Ah, it will be what you show me, something 
noble and wise ! " 

" I want to do this ; it s a magnificent part," 
said Miriam. 



384  

" You could n t put it on in London ; they 
would n t swallow it/ Basil Dashwood declared. 

" Are n t there things they do there, to get 
over the difficulties ? " 

" You can t get over what she did," the young 
man replied. 

" Yes, we must pay, we must expiate ! " Mrs. 
Rooth moaned, as the curtain rose again. 

When the second act was over our friends 
passed out of their baignoire into those corridors 
of tribulation where the bristling ouvrense, like a 
pawnbroker driving a roaring trade, mounts guard 
upon piles of heterogeneous clothing, and, gain 
ing the top of the fine staircase which forms the 
state entrance and connects the statued vestibule 
of the basement with the grand tier of boxes, 
opened an ambiguous door, composed of little 
mirrors, and found themselves in the society of 
the initiated. The janitors were courteous folk 
who greeted Sherringham as an acquaintance, 
and he had no difficulty in marshaling his little 
troop toward the foyer. They traversed a low, 
curving lobby, hung with pictures and furnished 
with velvet-covered benches, where several un 
recognized persons, of both sexes, looked at them 
without hostility, and arrived at an opening, on 
the right, from which, by a short flight of steps, 
there was a descent to one of the wings of the 
stage. Here Miriam paused, in silent excitement, 
like a young warrior arrested by a glimpse of the 
battlefield. Her vision was carried off, through 



 385 

a lane of light, to the point of vantage from 
which the actor held the house ; but there was a 
hushed guard over the place, and curiosity could 
only glance and pass. 

Then she came with her companions to a sort 
of parlor with a polished floor, not large and 
rather vacant, where her attention flew delight 
edly to a coat-tree, in a corner, from which three 
or four dresses were suspended dresses that 
she immediately perceived to be costumes in that 
night s play accompanied by a saucer of some 
thing and a much-worn powder-puff casually left 
upon a sofa. This was a familiar note in a gen 
eral impression (it had begun at the threshold) of 
high decorum a sense of majesty in the place. 
Miriam rushed at the powder-puff (there was no 
one in the room), snatched it up and gazed at it 
with droll veneration, then stood rapt a moment 
before the charming petticoats ("That s Dunoy- 
er s first underskirt," she said to her mother), 
while Sherringham explained that in this apart 
ment an actress traditionally changed her gown, 
when the transaction was simple enough, to save 
the long ascent to her loge. He felt like a cice 
rone showing a church to a party of provincials ; 
and indeed there was a grave hospitality in the 
air, mingled with something academic and impor 
tant, the tone of an institution, a temple, which 
made them all, out of respect and delicacy, hold 
their breath a little and tread the shining floors 
with discretion. 



386  

These precautions increased (Mrs. Rooth crept 
in like a friendly but undomesticated cat), after 
they entered the foyer itself, a square spacious 
saloon, covered with pictures and relics and 
draped in official green velvet, where the genius 
loci holds a reception every night in the year. 
The effect was freshly charming to Sherringham ; 
he was fond of the place, always saw it again 
with pleasure, enjoyed its honorable look and the 
way, among the portraits and scrolls, the records 
of a splendid history, the green velvet and the 
waxed floors, the genius loci seemed to be " at 
home " in the quiet lamplight. At the end of 
the room, in an ample chimney, blazed a fire of 
logs. Miriam said nothing ; they looked about, 
noting that most of the portraits and pictures 
were " old-fashioned," and Basil Dashwood ex 
pressed disappointment at the absence of all the 
people they wanted most to see. Three or four 
gentlemen, in evening dress, circulated slowly, 
looking, like themselves, at the pictures, and an 
other gentleman stood before a lady, with whom 
he was in conversation, seated against the wall. 
The foyer, in these conditions, resembled a ball 
room, cleared for the dance, before the guests or 
the music had arrived. 

" Oh, it s enough to see this ; it makes my 
heart beat," said Miriam. " It s full of the van 
ished past, it makes me cry. I feel them here, 
the great artists I shall never see. Think of 
Rachel (look at her grand portrait there !) and 



, 387 

how she stood on these very boards and trailed 
over them the robes of Hermione and Phedre ! " 
The girl broke out theatrically, as on the spot 
was right, not a bit afraid of her voice as soon as 
it rolled through the room ; appealing to her com 
panions as they stood under the chandelier and 
making the other persons present, who had al 
ready given her some attention, turn round to 
stare at so unusual a specimen of the English 
miss. She laughed, musically, when she noticed 
this, and her mother, scandalized, begged her to 
lower her tone. " It s all right. I produce an 
effect," said Miriam : " it sha n t be said that I 
too have n t had my little success in the maison 
de Moliere." And Sherringham repeated that it 
was all right the place was familiar with mirth 
and passion, there was often wonderful talk there, 
and it was only the setting that was still and sol 
emn, It happened that this evening there 
was no knowing in advance the scene was not 
characteristically brilliant ; but to confirm his as 
sertion, at the moment he spoke, Mademoiselle 
Dunoyer, who was also in the play, came into the 
room attended by a pair of gentlemen. 

She was the celebrated, the perpetual, the ne 
cessary ingtnuc, who with all her talent could not 
have represented a woman of her actual age. 
She had the gliding, hopping movement of a 
small bird, the same air of having nothing to do 
with time, and the clear, sure, piercing note, a 
miracle of exact vocalization. She chaffed her 



388  

companions, she chaffed the room ; she seemed 
to be a very clever little girl trying to personate 
a more innocent big one. She scattered her ami 
ability about (showing Miriam how much the 
children of Moliere took their ease), and it quickly 
placed her in the friendliest communication with 
Peter Sherringham, who already enjoyed her ac 
quaintance and who now extended it to his com 
panions, and in particular to the young lady sur 
le point d entrer au theatre. 

" You deserve a happier lot," said the actress, 
looking up at Miriam brightly, as if to a great 
height, and taking her in ; upon which Sherring 
ham left them together a little and led Mrs. 
Rooth and young Dashwood to consider further 
some of the pictures. 

" Most delightful, most curious," the old woman 
murmured, about everything ; while Basil Dash- 
wood exclaimed, in the presence of most of the 
portraits : " But their ugliness their ugliness : 
did you ever see such a collection of hideous 
people ? And those who were supposed to be 
good-looking the beauties of the past they 
are worse than the others. Ah, you may say 
what you will, nous sommes mieux que $a ! " 
Sherringham suspected him of irritation, of not 
liking the theatre of the great rival nation to be 
thrust down his throat. They returned to Mir 
iam and Mademoiselle Dunoyer, and Sherring 
ham asked the actress a question about one of 
the portraits, to which there was no name at- 



 389 

tached. She replied, like a child who had only 
played about the room, that she was toute honteuse 
not to be able to tell him the original : she had 
forgotten, she had never asked " Vous allez me 
trouver bien legere." She appealed to the other 
persons present, who formed a gallery for her, 
and laughed in delightful ripples at their sugges 
tions, which she covered with ridicule. She be 
stirred herself ; she declared she would ascertain, 
she should not be happy till she did, and swam 
out of the room, with the prettiest paddles, to 
obtain the information, leaving behind her a per 
fume of delicate kindness and gayety. She 
seemed above all things obliging, and Sherring- 
ham said that she was almost as natural off the 
stage as on. She did n t come back. 



XXI. 

WHETHER Sherringham had prearranged it is 
more than I can say, but Mademoiselle Voisin 
delayed so long to show herself that Mrs. Rooth, 
who wished to see the rest of the play, though 
she had sat it out on another occasion, expressed 
a returning relish for her corner of the baignoire 
and gave her conductor the best pretext he could 
have desired for asking Basil Dashwood to be so 
good as to escort her back. When the young 
actor, of whose personal preference Sherringham 
was quite aware, had led Mrs. Rooth away with 
an absence of moroseness which showed that his 
striking analogy with a gentleman was not kept 
for the footlights, the two others sat on a divan 
in the part of the room furthest from the entrance, 
so that it gave them a degree of privacy, and Mir 
iam watched the coming and going of their fel 
low-visitors and the indefinite people, attached to 
the theatre, hanging about, while her companion 
gave a name to some of the figures, Parisian 
celebrities. 

" Fancy poor Dashwood, cooped up there with 
mamma! " the girl exclaimed, whimsically. 

"You are awfully cruel to him ; but that s of 
course," said Sherringham. 



 39! 

" It seems to me I m as kind as you ; you sent 
him off." 

" That was for your mother ; she was tired." 

" Oh, gammon ! And why, if I were cruel, 
should it be of course ? " 

* Because you must destroy and torment and 
consume that s your nature. But you can t 
help your type, can you ? " 

" My type ? " the girl repeated. 

" It s bad, perverse, dangerous. It s essen 
tially insolent." 

" And pray what is yours, when you talk like 
that ? Would you say such things if you did n t 
know the depths of my good-nature ? " 

"Your good-nature all comes back to that," 
said Sherringham. " It s an abyss of ruin for 
others. You have no respect. I m speaking of 
the artistic character, in the direction and in the 
plenitude in which you have it. It s unscrupu 
lous, nervous, capricious, wanton." 

" I don t know about respect ; one can be 
good," Miriam reasoned. 

" It does n t matter, so long as one is power 
ful," answered Sherringham. " We can t have 
everything, and surely we ought to understand 
that we must pay for things. A splendid organi 
zation for a special end, like yours, is so rare and 
rich and fine that we ought n t to grudge it its 
conditions." 

" What do you call its conditions ? " Miriam 
demanded, turning and looking at him. 



39 2  

" Oh, the need to take its ease, to take up 
space, to make itself at home in the world, to 
square its elbows and knock others about. That s 
large and free; it s the good-nature you speak 
of. You must forage and ravage and leave a 
track behind you ; you must live upon the coun 
try you traverse. And you give such delight 
that, after all, you are welcome you are in 
finitely welcome ! " 

"I don t know what you mean. I only care 
for the idea," Miriam said. 

"That s exactly what I pretend ; and we must 
all help you to it. You use us, you push us 
about, you break us up. We are your tables and 
chairs, the simple furniture of your life." 
11 Whom do you mean by we ? " 
Sherringham gave a laugh. "Oh, don t be 
afraid there will be plenty of others." 

Miriam made no rejoinder to this, but after a 
moment she broke out again : " Poor Dashwood, 
immured with mamma he s like a lame chair 
that one has put into the corner." 

"Don t break him up before he has served. 
I really believe that something will come out of 
him," her companion went on. " However, you 11 
break me up first," he added, " and him probably 
never at all." 

"And why shall I honor you so much more?" 
" Because I m a better article, and you 11 feel 
that." 

You have the superiority of modesty I 



see. 



 393 

" I m better than a young mountebank I ve 
vanity enough to say that." 

She turned upon him with a flush in her cheek 
and a splendid dramatic face. " How you hate 
us ! Yes, at bottom, below your little taste, you 
hate us ! " she repeated. 

He colored too, met her eyes, looked into them 
a minute, seemed to accept the imputation, and 
then said, quickly, " Give it up : come away with 
me." 

" Come away with you ? " 

" Leave this place ; give it up." 

" You brought me here, you insisted it should 
be only you, and now you must stay," she de 
clared, with a head-shake and a laugh. " You 
should know what you want, dear Mr. Sherring- 
ham." 

"I do I know now. Come away, before she 
comes." 

" Before she comes ? " 

" She s success this wonderful Voisin 
she s triumph, she s full accomplishment : the 
hard, brilliant realization of what I want to avert 
for you." Miriam looked at him in silence, the 
angry light still in her face, and he repeated : 
" Give it up give it up." 

Her eyes softened after a moment ; she smiled, 
and then she said : " Yes, you re better than 
poor Dash wood." 

" Give it up, and we 11 live for ourselves, in our 
selves, in something that can have a sanctity." 



394  

" All the same, you do hate us," the girl went 
on. 

"I don t want to be conceited, but I mean 
that I m sufficiently fine and complicated to 
tempt you. I m an expensive modern watch, 
with a wonderful escapement therefore you 11 
smash me if you can." 

"Never never!" said the girl, getting up. 
" You tell me the hour too well." She quitted 
her companion and stood looking at Gerome s 
fine portrait of the pale Rachel, invested with the 
antique attributes of tragedy. The rise of the 
curtain had drawn away most of the company. 
Sherringham, from his bench, watched Miriam a 
little, turning his eye from her to the vivid image 
of the dead actress and thinking that his com 
panion suffered little by the juxtaposition. Pre 
sently he came over and joined her again, and she 
said to him, " I wonder if that is what your cousin 
had in his mind." 

" My cousin ? " 

" What was his name ? Mr. Dormer ; that first 
day at Madame Carre s. He offered to paint my 
portrait." 

"I remember. I put him up to it." 

" Was he thinking of this ? " 

" I don t think he has ever seen it. I dare say 
I was." 

" Well, when we go to London he must do it," 
said Miriam. 

" Oh, there s no hurry," Sherringham replied. 



^ 395 

" Don t you want my picture ? " asked the girl, 
with one of her successful touches. 

" I m not sure I want it from him. I don t 
know quite what he d make of you." 
^"He looked so clever I liked him. I saw 
him again at your party." 

" He s a dear fellow ; but what is one to say 
of a painter who goes for his inspiration to the 
House of Commons ? " 

" To the House of Commons ? " 

" He has lately got himself elected." 

" Dear me, what a pity ! I wanted to sit for 
him ; but perhaps he won t have me, as I m not 
a member of Parliament." 

"It s my sister, rather, who has got him in." 

" Your sister, who was at your house that day ? 
What has she to do with it ? " 

" Why, she s his cousin, just as I am. And 
in addition," Sherringham went on, " she s to be 
married to him." 

" Married really ? So he paints her, I sup 
pose ?" 

" Not much, probably. His talent in that line 
is n t what she esteems in him most." 

" It is n t great, then ? " 

"I haven t the least idea." 

" And in the political line ? " 

" I scarcely can tell. He s very clever." 

"He does paint, then?" 

" I dare say." i 

Miriam looked at Gerorne s picture again. 



396  

" Fancy his going into the House of Commons ! 
And your sister put him there ? " 

"She worked, she canvassed." 

" Ah, you re a queer family ! " the girl ex 
claimed, turning round at the sound of a step. . 

"We re lost here s Mademoiselle Voisin," 
said Sherringham. 

This celebrity presented herself smiling and 
addressing Miriam. "I acted for you to-night 
I did my best." 

"What a pleasure to speak to you, to thank 
you ! " the girl murmured, admiringly. She was 
startled and dazzled. 

" I couldn t come to you before, but now I ve 
got a rest for half an hour," the actress went 
on. Gracious and passive, as if she were a little 
tired, she let Sherringham, without looking at 
him, take her hand and raise it to his lips. " I m 
sorry I make you lose the others they are so 
good in this act," she added. 

"We have seen them before, and there s noth 
ing so good as you," Miriam replied. 

"I like my part," said Mademoiselle Voisin, 
gently, smiling still at our young lady with clear, 
charming eyes. " One is always better, in that 
case." 

" She s so bad sometimes, you know ! " Sher 
ringham jested, to Miriam ; leading the actress 
to glance at him kindly and vaguely, with a little 
silence which, with her, you could not call em 
barrassment, but which was still less affectation. 



 397 

" And it s so interesting to be here so inter 
esting ! " Miriam declared. 

"Ah, you like our old house? Yes, we are 
very proud of it." And Mademoiselle Voisin 
smiled again at Sherringham, good-humoredly, as 
if to say : u Well, here I am, and what do you 
want of me ? Don t ask me to invent it myself, 
but if you 11 tell me I 11 do it." Miriam admired 
the note of discreet interrogation in her voice - 
the slight suggestion of surprise at their " old 
house" being liked. The actress was already an 
astonishment to her, from her seeming still more 
perfect on a nearer view, which was not, she had 
an idea, what actresses usually did. This was 
very encouraging to her ; it widened the pro 
gramme of a young lady about to embrace the 
scenic career. To have so much to show before 
the footlights and yet to have so much left when 
you came off that was really wonderful. Ma 
demoiselle Voisin s eyes, as one looked into them, 
were still more agreeable than the distant spec 
tator would have supposed ; and there was in her 
appearance an extreme finish which instantly 
suggested to Miriam that she herself, in compar 
ison, was big and rough and coarse. 

" You re lovely to-night you re particularly 
lovely," said Sherringham, very frankly, trans 
lating Miriam s own impression and at the same 
time giving her an illustration of the way that, 
in Paris at least, gentlemen expressed themselves 
to the stars of the drama. She thought she 



398  

knew her companion very well, and had been 
witness of the degree to which, under these cir 
cumstances, his familiarity could increase ; but 
his address to the slim, distinguished, harmonious 
woman before them had a different quality, the 
note of a special usage. If Miriam had had any 
apprehension that such directness might be 
taken as excessive, it was removed by the man 
ner in which Mademoiselle Voisin return-ed 

" Oh, one is always well enough when one is 
made up ; one is always exactly the same." That 
served as an example of the good taste with 
which a star of the drama could receive homage 
that was wanting in originality. Miriam deter 
mined, on the spot, that this should be the way 
she would receive it. The grace of her new ac 
quaintance was the greater as the becoming 
bloom which she alluded to as artificial was the 
result of a science so consummate that it had 
none of the grossness of a mask. The percep 
tion of all this was exciting to our young aspi 
rant, and her excitement relieved itself in the 
inquiry, which struck her as rude as soon as she 
had uttered it 

" You acted for me ? How did you know ? 
What am I to you ? " 

" Monsieur Sherringham has told me about 
you. He says we are nothing beside you ; that 
you are to be the great star of the future. I m 
proud that you ve seen- me." 

" That of course is what I tell every one," 



 399 

Sherringham said, a trifle awkwardly, to Mir 
iam. 

" I can believe it when I see you. Je vous ai 
bien observee," the actress continued in her 
sweet, conciliatory tone. 

Miriam looked from one of her interlocutors to 
the other, as if there was a joy to her in this 
report of Sherringham s remarks, accompanied, 
however, and partly mitigated, by a quicker vision 
of what might have passed between a secretary 
of embassy and a creature so exquisite as Made 
moiselle Voisin. 

"Ah, you re wonderful people a most inter 
esting impression ! " she sighed. 

" I was looking for you ; he had prepared me. 
We are such old friends ! " said the actress, in a 
tone courteously exempt from intention : upon 
which Sherringham again took her hand and 
raised it to his lips, with a tenderness which her 
whole appearance seemed to bespeak for her, a 
sort of practical consideration and carefulness of 
touch, as if she were an object precious and frail, 
an instrument for producing rare sounds, to be 
handled, like a legendary violin, with a recogni 
tion of its value. 

"Your dressing-room is so pretty show her 
your dressing-room," said Sherringham. 

"Willingly, if she ll come up. Vous savez 
c est une montee." 

"It s a shame to inflict it onj^/," Miriam ob 
jected. 






40Q  

" Comment done ? If it will interest you in 
the least ! " They exchanged civilities, almost 
caresses, trying which could have the nicest man 
ner to the other. It was the actress s manner 
that struck Miriam most ; it denoted such a 
training, so much taste, expressed such a ripe 
conception of urbanity. 

" No wonder she acts well when she has that 
tact feels, perceives, is so remarkable, won 
Dieu, mon Dieu ! " Miriam said to herself as they 
followed their conductress into another corridor 
and up a wide, plain staircase. The staircase 
was spacious and long, and this part of the estab 
lishment was sombre and still, with the gravity 
of a college or a convent. They reached another 
passage, lined with little doors, on each of which 
the name of a comedian w r as painted ; and here 
the aspect became still more monastic, like that 
of a row of solitary cells. Mademoiselle Voisin led 
the way to her own door, obligingly, as if she 
wished to be hospitable, dropping little subdued, 
friendly attempts at explanation on the way. At 
her threshold the monasticism stopped. Miriam 
found herself in a wonderfully upholstered nook, 
a nest of lamplight and delicate cretonne. Save 
for its pair of long glasses it looked like a tiny 
boudoir, with a water-color drawing of value in 
each panel of stretched stuff, its crackling fire, 
its charming order. It was intensely bright and 
extremely hot, singularly pretty and exempt from 
litter. Nothing was lying about, but a small 



 40 1 

draped doorway led into an inner sanctuary. To 
Miriam it seemed royal ; it immediately made the 
art of the comedian the most distinguished thing 
in the world. It was just such a place as they 
should have, in the intervals, if they were ex 
pected to be great artists. It was a result of the 
same evolution as Mademoiselle Voisin herself 
not that our young lady found this particular 
term to her hand, to express her idea. But her 
mind was flooded with an impression of style, of 
refinement, of the long continuity of a tradition. 
The actress said, " Voila c est tout !" as if it wero 
little enough and there were even something 
clumsy in her having brought them so far for 
nothing, and in their all sitting there waiting and 
looking at each other till it was time for her to 
change her dress. But to Miriam it was occu 
pation enough to note what she did and said : 
these things and her whole person and carriage 
struck her as exquisite in their adaptation to the 
particular occasion. She had had an idea that 
foreign actresses were rather of the cabotin or 
der ; but her hostess suggested to her much more 
a princess than a cabotine. She would do things 
as she liked, and straight off : Miriam could n t 
fancy her in the gropings and humiliations of re 
hearsal. Everything in her had been sifted and 
formed, her tone was perfect, her amiability com 
plete, and she might have been the charming 
young wife of a secretary of state receiving a 
pair of strangers of distinction. Miriam observed 



402  

all her movements. And then, as Sherringham 
had said, she was particularly lovely. 

Suddenly she told Sherringham that she must 
put him a la porte she wanted to change her 
dress. He retired and returned to the foyer, 
where Miriam was to rejoin him after remaining 
the few minutes more with Mademoiselle Voisin 
and coming down with her. He waited for his 
companion, walking up and down and making up 
his mind ; and when she presently came in he 
said to her : 

" Please don t go back for the rest of the play. 
Stay here." They now had the foyer virtually 
to themselves. 

" I want to stay here. I like it better." She 
moved back to the chimney-piece, from above 
which the cold portrait of Rachel looked down, 
and as he accompanied her he said : 

" I meant what I said just now." 

" What you said to Voisin ? " 

" No, no ; to you. Give it up and live with 
me." 

" Give it up ? " And she turned her stage face 
upon him. 

" Give it up, and I 11 marry you to-morrow." 

" This is a happy time to ask it ! " she mocked. 
"And this is a good place." 

"Very good indeed, and that s why I speak: 
it s a place to make one choose it puts it all 
before one." 

" To make you choose, you mean. I m much 



 403 

obliged, but that s not my choice," laughed 
Miriam. 

" You shall be anything you like, except this." 

" Except what I most want to be ? I am much 
obliged." 

" Don t you care for me ? Have n t you any 
gratitude ? " Sherringham asked. 

" Gratitude for kindly removing the blessed 
cup from my lips ? I want to be what she is 
I want it more than ever." 

" Ah, what she is ! " he replied impatiently. 

" Do you mean I can t? We 11 see if I can t. 
Tell me more about her tell me everything.- 

" Have n t you seen for yourself, and can t you 
judge?" 

" She s strange, she s mysterious," Miriam 
declared, looking at the fire. " She showed us 
nothing nothing of her real self." 

"So much the better, all things considered." 

"Are there all sorts of other things in her life ? 
That s what I believe," Miriam went on, raising 
her eyes to him. 

" I can t tell you what there is in the life of 
such a woman." 

" Imagine when she s so perfect ! " the girl 
exclaimed, thoughtfully. " Ah, she kept me off 
she kept me off ! Her charming manner is in 
itself a kind of contempt. It s an abyss it s 
the wall of China. She has a hard polish, an in 
imitable surface, like some wonderful porcelain 
that costs more than you d think." 



404  

" Do you want to become like that ? " Sher- 
ringham asked. 

" If I could I should be enchanted. One can 
always try." 

" You must act better than she," said Sher- 
ringham. 

" Better? I thought you wanted me to give it 
up." 

" Ah, I don t know what I want, and you tor 
ment me and turn me inside out ! What I want 
is you yourself." 

" Oh, don t worry," said Miriam, kindly. Then 
she added that Mademoiselle Voisin had asked 
her to come to see her ; to which Sherringham 
replied, with a certain dryness, that she would 
probably not find that necessary. This made 
Miriam stare, and she asked : " Do you mean it 
won t do, on account of mamma s prejudices ? " 

" Say, this time, on account of mine." 

" Do you mean because she has lovers ? " 

" Her lovers are none of our business." 

" None of mine, I see. So you have been one 
of them ? " 

" No such luck." 

"What a pity!* I should have liked to see 
that. One must see everything, to be able to do 
everything." And as he inquired what she had 
wished to see she replied : " The way a woman 
like that receives one of the old ones." 

Sherringham gave a groan at this, which was 
at the same time partly a laugh, and, turning 






 405 

away and dropping upon a bench, ejaculated : 
"You ll do you ll do!" 

He sat there some minutes, with his elbows on 
his knees and his face in his hands. Miriam re 
mained looking at the portrait of Rachel ; after 
which she demanded: " Does n t such a woman 
as that receive receive every one ? " 

" Every one who goes to see her, no doubt." 

" And who goes ? " 

" Lots of men clever men, eminent men." 

" Ah, what a charming life ! Then does n t 
she go out ? " 

" Not what we Philistines mean by that not 
into society, never. She never enters a lady s 
drawing-room." 

"How strange, when one s as distinguished 
as that ; except that she must escape a lot of stu 
pidities and corvees. Then where does she learn 
such manners ? " 

" She teaches manners, d ses heures : she 
does n t need to learn them." 

" Oh, she has given me ideas ! But in London 
actresses go into society," Miriam continued. 

" Oh, in London nous melons les genres ! " 

" And sha n t I go I mean if I want ? " 

"You ll have every facility to bore yourself. 
Don t doubt of it." 

" And does n t she feel excluded ? " Miriam 
asked. 

" Excluded from what ? She has the fullest 
life." 



406  

" The fullest ? " 

" An intense artistic life. The cleverest men 
in Paris talk over her work with her ; the prin 
cipal authors of plays discuss with her subjects 
and characters and questions of treatment. She 
lives in the world of art." 

" Ah, the world of art how I envy her ! 
And you offer me Dashwood ! " 

Sherringham rose in his emotion. " I offer 
you ? " 

Miriam burst out laughing. " You look so 
droll ! You offer me yourself then, instead of all 
these things." 

" My child, I also am a very clever man," he 
said, smiling, though conscious that for a moment 
he had stood gaping. 

" You are you are ; I delight in you. No 
ladies at all no femmes comme ilfaut ? " Mir 
iam began again. 

" Ah, what do they matter ? Your business is 
the artistic life ! " he broke out, with inconse 
quence and with a little irritation at hearing her 
sound that trivial note again. 

"You re a dear your charming good sense 
comes back to you ! What do you want of me, 
then ? " 

" I want you for myself not for others ; and 
now, in time, before anything s done." 

" Why then did you bring me here ? Every 
thing s done ; I feel it to-night." 

"I know the way you should look at it 



 407 

if you do look at it at all," Sherringham con 
ceded. 

" That s so easy ! I thought you liked the 
stage so," Miriam said, artfully. 

" Don t you want me to be a great swell ? " 

" And don t you want me to be ? " 

" You will be you 11 share my glory." 

"So will you share mine." 

"The husband of an actress? Yes, I m 
that ! " Sherringham cried, with a frank ring of 
disgust. 

" It s a silly position, no doubt. But if you re 
too good for it why talk about it ? Don t you 
think I m important ? " Miriam inquired. Her 
companion stood looking at her, and she suddenly 
said, in a different tone : " Ah, why should we 
quarrel, when you have been so kind, so gener 
ous ? Can t we always befriends the solidest 
friends ? " 

Her voice sank to the sweetest cadence and 
her eyes were grateful and good as they rested on 
him. She sometimes said things with such per 
fection that they seemed dishonest, but in this 
case Sherringham was stirred to an expressive 
response. Just as he was making it, however, he 
was moved to utter other words " Take care, 
here s Dashwood ! " Mrs. Rooth s companion 
was in the doorway. He had come back to say 
that they really must relieve him. 



XXII. 

MRS. DALLOW came up to London soon after the 
meeting of Parliament ; she made no secret of 
the fact that she was fond of the place, and natu 
rally, in present conditions, it would not have be 
come less attractive to her. But she prepared to 
withdraw from it again for the Easter vacation, 
not to return to Harsh, but to pay a couple of 
country visits. She did not, however, leave town 
with the crowd she never did anything with 
the crowd but waited till the Monday after 
Parliament rose ; facing with composure, in Great 
Stanhope Street, the horrors, as she had been 
taught to consider them, of a Sunday out of the 
session. She had done what she could to miti 
gate them by asking a handful of " stray men " to 
dine with her that evening. Several members of 
this disconsolate class sought comfort in Great 
Stanhope Street in the afternoon, and them, for 
the most part, she also invited to come back at 
eight o clock. There were, therefore, almost too 
many people at dinner there were even a 
couple of wives. Nick Dormer came to dinner, 
but he was not present in the afternoon. Each 
of the persons who were had said on coming in, 
" So you ve not gone I m awfully glad." Mrs. 



 409 

Dallow had replied, " No, I ve not gone," but she 
had in no case added that she was glad, nor had 
she offered an explanation. She never offered 
explanations : she always assumed that no one 
could invent them so well as those who had the 
florid taste to desire them. 

And in this case she was right, for it is prob 
able that few of her visitors failed to say to them 
selves that her not having gone would have had 
something to do with Dormer. That could pass 
for an explanation with many of Mrs. Dallow s 
visitors, who, as a general thing, were not mor 
bidly analytic ; especially with those who met 
Nick as a matter of course at the dinner. His 
being present at this lady s entertainments, being 
in her house whenever, as the phrase was, a 
candle was lighted, was taken as a sign that 
there was something rather particular between 
them. Nick had said to her, more than once, 
that people would wonder why they did n t marry ; 
but he was wrong in this, inasmuch as there were 
many of their friends to whom it would not have 
occurred that his position could be improved by 
it. That they were cousins was a fact not so 
evident to others as to themselves, in consequence 
of which they appeared remarkably intimate. 
The person seeing clearest in the matter was 
Mrs. Gresham, who lived so much in the world 
that being alone had become her idea of true so 
ciability. She knew very well that if she had 
been privately engaged to a young man as amia- 



410  

ble as Nick Dormer she would have managed 
that publicity should not play such a part in their 
intercourse ; and she had her secret scorn for the 
stupidity of people whose conception of Nick s 
relation to Julia Dallow rested on the fact that he 
was always included in her parties. " If he never 
was there they might talk," she said to herself. 
But Mrs. Gresham was supersubtle. To her it 
would have appeared natural that Julia should 
celebrate the parliamentary recess by going down 
to Harsh and securing Nick s company there for 
a fortnight ; she recognized Mrs. Dallow s actual 
plan as a comparatively poor substitute the 
project of spending the holidays in other people s 
houses, to which Nick had also promised to come. 
Mrs. Gresham was romantic ; she wondered what 
was the good of mere snippets and snatches, the 
chances that any one might have, when large, 
still days a deux were open to you chances of 
which half the sanctity was in what they excluded. 
However, there were more unsettled matters be 
tween Mrs. Dallow and her queer kinsman than 
even Mrs. Gresham s fine insight could embrace. 
She was not present, on the Sunday before Easter, 
at the dinner in Great Stanhope Street ; but if 
she had been Julia s singular indifference to ob 
servation would have stopped short of encourag 
ing her to remain in the drawing-room, with Nick, 
after the others had gone. I may add that Mrs. 
Gresham s extreme curiosity would have embold 
ened her as little to do so. She would have taken 



 411 

for granted that the pair wished to be alone to 
gether, though she would have regarded this only 
as a snippet. 

The guests stayed late and it was nearly twelve 
o clock when Nick, standing before the fire in the 
room they had quitted, broke out to his compan 
ion : 

" See here, Julia, how long do you really ex 
pect me to endure this kind of thing ? " Mrs. 
Dallow made hina no answer ; she only leaned 
back in her chair with her eyes upon his. He 
met her gaze for a moment ; then he turned round 
to the fire and for another moment looked into it. 
After this he faced Mrs. Dallow again, with the 
exclamation, " It s so foolish it s so damnably 
foolish ! " 

She still said nothing, but at the end of a min 
ute she spoke without answering him. " I shall 
expect you on Tuesday, and I hope you 11 come 
by a decent train." 

" What do you mean by a decent train ?" 

" I mean I hope you 11 not leave it till the last 
thing before dinner, so that we can have a little 
walk, or something." 

"What s a little walk, or something? Why, 
if you make such a point of my coming to Griffin, 
do you want me to come at all ? " 

Mrs. Dallow hesitated an instant ; then she ex 
claimed : " I knew you hated it ! " 

" You provoke me so," said Nick. " You try 
to, I think." 



4 12  

" And Severals still worse. You 11 get out of 
that if you can," Mrs. Dallow went on. 
" If I can ? What s to prevent me ? " 
" You promised Lady Whiteroy. But of course 
that s nothing." 

"I don t care a straw for Lady Whiteroy." 
" And you promised me. But that s less 
still." 

"It is foolish it s quite idiotic," said Nick, 
with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the 
ceiling. 

There was another silence, at the end of which 
Mrs. Dallow remarked: "You might have an 
swered Mr. Macgeorge when he spoke to you." 

" Mr. Macgeorge what has he to do with 
it ? " 

" He has to do with your getting on a little. 
If you think that s the way ! " 

Nick broke into a laugh. I like lessons in 
getting on in other words, I suppose you mean 
in urbanity from you, Julia ! " 

"Why not from me?" 

" Because you can do nothing base. You re 
incapable of putting on a flattering manner, to 
get something by it : therefore, why should you 
expect me to ? You re unflattering that is, 
you re austere in proportion as there may be 
something to be got." 

Mrs. Dallow sprang up from her chair, coming 
towards him. There is only one thing I want 
in the world you know very well." 



 413 

" Yes, you want it so much that you won t 
even take it when it s pressed upon you. How 
long do you seriously expect me to bear it ? " 
Nick repeated. 

" I never asked you to do anything base," she 
said, standing in front of him. " If I m not 
clever about throwing myself into things, it s 
all the more reason you should be." 

" If you re not clever, my dear Julia ? " Nick, 
standing close to her, placed his hands on her 
shoulders and shook her a little, with a mix 
ture of tenderness and passion. " You re clever 
enough to make me furious, sometimes ! " 

She opened and closed her fan, looking down 
at it while she submitted to this attenuated vio 
lence. " All I want is that when a man like Mr. 
Macgeorge talks to you, you should n t appear 
to be bored to death. You used to be so charm 
ing, in that sort of way. And now you appear 
to take no interest in anything. At dinner, to 
night, you scarcely opened your lips ; you treated 
them all as if you only wished they d go." 

" I did wish they d go. Have n t I told you a 
hundred times what I think of your salon ? " 

" How then do you want me to live?" Mrs. 
Dallow asked. " Am I not to have a creature in 
the house ? " 

" As many creatures as you like. Your free 
dom is complete, and as far as I am concerned 
always will be. Only when you challenge me 
and overhaul me -- not justly, I think I must 



414 THE TRAGIC to TSE. 

confess the simple truth, that there are many of 
your friends I don t delight in." 

"Q\\,yotir idea of pleasant people!" Julia ex 
claimed. "I should like once for all to know 
what it really is." 

" I can tell you what it really is n t : it is n t 
Mr. Macgeorge. He s a being almost grotesquely 
limited." 

" He 11 be where you 11 never be unless you 
change." 

" To be where Mr. Macgeorge is not would be 
very much my desire. Therefore, why should I 
change ? " Nick demanded. " However, I had n t 
the least intention of being rude to him, and I 
don t think I was," he went on. "To the best 
of my ability I assume a virtue if I have it not ; 
but apparently I m not enough of a comedian." 

" If you have it not ? It s when you say things 
like that that you re so dreadfully tiresome. As 
if there were anything that you have n t or 
might n t have ! " 

Nick turned away from his hostess ; he took a 
few impatient steps in the room, looking at the 
carpet, with his hands in his pockets again. 
Then he came back to the fire with the observa 
tion, " It s rather hard to be found so wanting 
when one has tried to play one s part so beauti 
fully." He paused, with his eyes on Mrs. Dai- 
low s ; then continued, with a vibration in his 
voice : " I ve imperiled my immortal soul, or at 
least I ve bemuddled my intelligence, by all the 



, 415 

things I don t care for that I ve tried to do, and 
all the things I detest that I Ve tried to be, and 
all the things I never can be that I ve tried to 
look as if I were all the appearances and imita 
tions, the pretenses and hypocrisies in which I ve 
steeped myself to the eyes ; and at the end of it 
(it serves me right !) my reward is simply to 
learn that I m still not half humbug enough ! " 

Mrs. Dallow looked away from him as soon as 
he had spoken these words ; she attached her 
eyes to the clock which stood behind him, and 
observed irrelevantly : 

" I m very sorry, but I think you had better 
go. I don t like you to stay after midnight." 

"Ah, what you like and what you don t like, 
and where one begins and the other ends all 
that is an impenetrable mystery ! " - the young 
man declared. But he took no further notice of 
her allusion to his departure, adding, in a dif 
ferent tone : " A man like Mr. Macgeorge ! 
When you say a thing of that sort, in a certain 
particular way, I should rather like to suffer you 
to perish." 

Mrs. Dallow stared ; it might have seemed for 
an instant that she was trying to look stupid. 
" How can I help it if a few years hence he is 
certain to be at the head of any Liberal govern 
ment ?" 

" We can t help it, of course, but we can help 
talking about it," Nick smiled. "If we don t 
mention it, it may not be noticed." 



41 6  

" You re trying to make me angry. You re 
in one of your vicious moods," observed Mrs. 
Dallow, blowing out, on the chimney - piece, a 
guttering candle. 

" That I am exasperated I have already had 
the honor very positively to inform you. All the 
same I maintain that I was irreproachable at 
dinner. I don t want you to think I shall always 
be so good as that." 

"You looked so out of it ; you were as gloomy 
as if every earthly hope had left you, and you 
did n t make a single contribution to any discus 
sion that took place. Don t you think I observe 
you ? " Mrs. Dallow asked, with an irony tem 
pered by a tenderness that was unsuccessfully 
concealed. 

"Ah, my -darling, what you observe!" Nick 
exclaimed, laughing, and stopping. But he added 
the next moment, more seriously, as if his tone 
had been disrespectful : " You probe me to the 
bottom, no doubt." 

" You need n t come either to Griffin or to 
Severals if you don t want to." 

" Give them up yourself ; stay here with me ! " 

She colored quickly, as he said this, and broke 
out : " Lord ! how you hate political houses ! " 

" How can you say that, when from February 
to August I spend every blessed night in one ? " 

"Yes, and hate that worst of all." 

"So do half the people who are in it. You 
must have so many things, so many people, so 



 417 

much mise-en-sc&ue "a.\\& such a perpetual spectacle 
to live," Nick went on. " Perpetual motion, per 
petual visits, perpetual crowds ! If you go into 
the country you 11 see forty people every day and 
be mixed up with them all day. The idea of a 
quiet fortnight in town, when by a happy if idi 
otic superstition everybody goes out of it, dis 
concerts and frightens you. It s the very time, 
it s the very place, to do a little work and possess 
one s soul." 

This vehement allocution found Mrs. Dallow 
evidently somewhat unprepared ; but she was 
sagacious enough, instead of attempting for the 
moment a general rejoinder, to seize on a single 
phrase and say : " Work ? What work can you 
do in London at such a moment as this ? " 

Nick hesitated a little. " I might tell you that 
I wanted to get up a lot of subjects, to sit at 
home and read bluebooks ; but that would n t be 
quite what I mean." 

" Do you mean you want to paint ? " 

"Yes, that s it, since you drag it out of me." 

" Why do you make such a mystery about it ? 
You re at perfect liberty," said Mrs. Dallow. 

She extended her hand to rest it on the man 
tel-shelf, but her companion took it, on the way, 
and held it in both his own. " You are delight 
ful, Julia, when you speak in that tone then I 
know why it is I love you ; but I can t do any 
thing if I go to Griffin, if I go to Severals." 

" I see I see," said Julia, reflectively and 
kindly. 



41 8  

" I ve scarcely been inside of my studio for 
months, and I feel quite homesick for it. The 
idea of putting in a few quiet days there has 
taken hold of me : I rather cling to it." 

" It seems so odd, your having a studio ! " Julia 
dropped, speaking so quickly that the words were 
almost incomprehensible. 

" Does n t it sound absurd, for all the good it 
does me, or I do in it ? Of course one can pro 
duce nothing but rubbish on such terms with 
out continuity or persistence, with just a few 
days here and there. I ought to be ashamed of 
myself, no doubt ; but even my rubbish interests 
me. Guenille si Ton vent, ma guerrilla m est 
chere. But I 11 go down to Harsh with you, in 
a moment, Julia," Nick pursued : " that would do 
as well, if we could be quiet there, without peo 
ple, without a creature ; and I should really be 
perfectly content. You d sit for me ; it would 
be the occasion we ve so often wanted and never 
found." 

Mrs. Dallow shook her head slowly, with a 
smile that had a meaning for Nick. "Thank 
you, my dear ; nothing would induce me to go to 
Harsh with you." 

The young man looked at her. " What s the 
matter, whenever it s a question of anything of 
that sort ? Are you afraid of me ? " She pulled 
her hand quickly out of his, turning away from 
him ; but he went on : " Stay with me here, then, 
when everything is so right for it. We shall do 



 419 

beautifully have the whole place, have the 
whole day to ourselves. Hang your engage 
ments ! Telegraph you won t come. We 11 live 
at the studio you 11 sit to me every day. Now 
or never is our chance when shall we have so 
good a one ? Think how charming it will be ! 
I 11 make you wish awfully that I shall do some 
thing." 

" I can t get out of Griffin it s impossible," 
returned Mrs. Dallow, moving further away, with 
her back presented to him. 

" Then you are afraid of me simply ! " 

She turned quickly round, very pale. " Of 
course I am ; you are welcome to know it." 

He went toward her, and for a moment she 
seemed to make another slight movement of re 
treat. This, however, was scarcely perceptible, 
and there was nothing to alarm in the tone of 
reasonable entreaty in which Nick said to her, 
as he went toward her: " Put an end, Julia, to 
our absurd situation it really can t go on : you 
have no right to expect a man to be happy or 
comfortable in so false a position. We re talked 
of odiously of that we may be sure; and yet 
what good have we of it ? " 

" Talked of ? Do I care for that ? " 

" Do you mean you re indifferent because there 
are no grounds ? That s just why I hate it." 

" I don t know what you re talking about ! " 
exclaimed Mrs. Dallow, with quick disdain. 

" Be my wife to-morrow be my wife next 



420  

week. Let us have done with this fantastic pro 
bation and be happy." . 

" Leave me now come back to-morrow. I 11 
write to you." She had the air of pleading with 
him at present as he pleaded with her. 

"You can t resign yourself to the idea of one s 
looking * out of it ! " laughed Nick. 

"Come to-morrow, before lunch," Mrs. Dallow 
continued. 

" To be told I must wait six months more and 
then be sent about my business ? Ah, Julia, 
Julia ! " murmured the young man. 

Something in this simple exclamation it 
sounded natural and perfectly unstudied evi 
dently, on the instant, made a great impression 
on his companion. 

"You shall wait no longer," she said, after a 
short silence. 

" What do you mean by no longer ? " 

" Give me about five weeks say till the 
Whitsuntide recess." 

" Five weeks are a great deal," smiled Nick. 

" There are things to be done you ought to 
understand." 

" I only understand how I love you." 

" Dearest Nick ! " said Mrs. Dallow ; upon 
which he caught her in his arms. 

"I have your promise, then, for five weeks 
hence, to a day ? " he demanded, as she released 
herself. 

" We 11 settle that the exact day : there are 



 421 

things to consider and to arrange. Come to lun 
cheon, to-morrow." 

"I ll come early I ll come at one," Nick 
said ; and for a moment they stood smiling at 
each other. 

" Do you think I want to wait, any more than 
you ? " Mrs. Dallow asked. 

" I don t feel so much out of it now ! " he ex 
claimed, by way of answer. "You ll stay, of 
course, now you 11 give up your visits ? " 

She had hold of the lappet of his coat ; she 
had kept it in her hand even while she detached 
herself from his embrace. There was a white 
flower in his buttonhole which she looked at and 
played with a moment before she said : " I have a 
better idea you need n t come to Griffin. Stay 
in your studio do as you like paint dozens 
of pictures." 

" Dozens ? You barbarian ! " Nick ejaculated. 

The epithet apparently had an endearing sug 
gestion to Mrs. Dallow ; at any rate it led her to 
allow him to kiss her on her forehead led her 
to say, " What on earth do I want but that you 
should do absolutely as you please and be as 
happy as you can ? " 

Nick kissed her again, in another place, at this ; 
but he inquired : " What dreadful proposition is 
coming now ? " 

" I 11 go off and do up my visits and come 
back." 

" And leave me alone ? " 



422.  

" Don t be affected ! " said Mrs. Dallow. " You 
know you 11 work much better without me. 
You 11 live in your studio I shall be well out 
of the way." 

" That s not what one wants of a sitter. How 
can I paint you ? " 

" You can paint me all the rest of your life. I 
shall be a perpetual sitter." 

" I believe I could paint you without looking 
at you," said Nick, smiling down at her. " You 
do excuse me, then, from those dreary places ? " 

"How can I insist, after what you said about 
the pleasure of keeping these days ? " Mrs. Dal 
low asked sweetly. 

" You re the best woman on earth ; though it 
does seem odd you should rush away as soon as 
our little business is settled." 

" We shall make it up. I know what I m 
about. And now go ! " Mrs. Dallow terminated, 
almost pushing her visitor out of the room. 




IT was certainly singular, under the circum 
stances, that on sitting down in his studio, after 
Julia had left town, Nick Dormer should not, as 
regards the effort to reproduce some beautiful 
form, have felt more chilled by the absence of a 
friend who was such an embodiment of beauty. 
She was away, and he longed for her, and yet 
without her the place was more filled with what 
he wanted to find in it. He turned into it with 
confused feelings, the most definite of which was 
a sense of release and recreation. It looked 
blighted and lonely and dusty, and his old studies, 
as he rummaged them out, struck him as even 
clumsier than the last time he had ventured to 
drop his eyes upon them. But amid this neg 
lected litter, in the colorless and obstructed light 
of a high north window which needed washing, 
he tasted more sharply the possibility of pos 
itive happiness : it appeared to him that, as he 
had said to Julia, he was more in possession 
of his soul. It Was frivolity and folly, it was 





424  

puerility to spend valuable hours pottering over 
the vain implements of an art he had relin 
quished ; and a certain shame that he had felt in 
presenting his plea to Julia Dallow that Sunday 
night arose from the sense not of what he clung 
to, but of what he had given up. He had turned 
his back upon serious work, so that pottering was 
now all he could aspire to. It could n t be fruit 
ful, it could n t be anything but ridiculous, almost 
ignoble ; but it soothed his nerves, it was in the 
nature of a secret dissipation. He had never 
suspected that he should ever have, on his own 
part, nerves to count with ; but this possibility 
had been revealed to him on the day it became 
clear that he was letting something precious go. 
He was glad he had not to justify himself to the 
critical, for this might have been a delicate busi 
ness. The critical were mostly absent ; and be 
sides, shut up all day in his studio, how should 
he ever meet them ? It was the place in the 
world where he felt furthest away from his con 
stituents. That was a part of the pleasure the 
consciousness that for the hour the coast was 
clear and his mind was free. His mother and his 
sister had gone to Broadwood : Lady Agnes (the 
phrase sounds brutal, but it represents his state 
of mind) was well out of the way. He had writ 
ten to her as soon as Julia left town he had 
apprised her of the fact that his wedding-day was 
fixed : a relief, for poor Lady Agnes, to a period 
of intolerable mystification, of taciturn wondering 



 

and watching. She had said her say the day of 
the poll at Harsh ; she was too proud to ask and 
too discreet to " nag ; " so she could only wait 
for something that did n t arrive. The uncondi 
tioned loan of Broadwood had of course been 
something of a bribe to patience : she had at first 
felt that on the day she should take possession 
of that capital house Julia would indeed seem to 
have come into the family. But the gift had con 
firmed expectations just enough to make disap 
pointment more bitter ; and the discomfort was 
greater in proportion as Lady Agnes failed to 
discover what was the matter. Her daughter 
Grace was much occupied with this question, and 
brought it up in conversation, in a manner irri 
tating to her ladyship, who had a high theory of 
being silent about it, but who, however, in the 
long run, was more unhappy when, in conse 
quence of a reprimand, the girl suggested no 
reasons at all than when she suggested stupid 
ones. It eased Lady Agnes a little to discuss 
the mystery, when she could have the air of not 
having begun. 

The letter Nick received from her the first day 
of Passion Week, in reply to his important com 
munication, was the only one he read at that 
moment ; not counting, of course, several notes 
that Mrs. Dallow addressed to him from Griffin. 
There were letters piled up, as he knew, in Cal 
cutta Gardens, which his servant had strict orders 
not to bring to the studio. Nick slept now in the 



426  

bedroom attached to this retreat ; got things, as 
he wanted them, from Calcutta Gardens ; and 
dined at his club, where a stray surviving friend 
or two, seeing him prowl about the library in the 
evening, was free to suppose that such eccen 
tricity had a subtly political basis. When he 
thought of his neglected letters he remembered 
Mr. Carteret s convictions on the subject of not 
"getting behind ;" they made him laugh, in the 
slightly sonorous painting-room, as he bent over 
one of the old canvases that he had ventured to 
turn to the light. He was fully determined, how 
ever, to master his correspondence before going 
down, the last thing before Parliament should 
reassemble, to spend another day at Beauclere. 
Mastering his correspondence meant, in Nick s 
mind, breaking open envelopes ; writing answers 
was scarcely involved in the idea. But Mr. Car- 
teret would never guess that. Nick was not 
moved even to write to him that the affair with 
Mrs. Dallow was on the point of taking the form 
he had been so good as to desire : he reserved the 
pleasure of this announcement for a personal in 
terview. 

The day before Good Friday, in the morning, 
his stillness was broken by a rat-tat-tat on the 
outer door of his studio, administered apparently 
by the knob of a walking-stick. His servant was 
out, and he went to the door, wondering who his 
visitor could be, at such a time, especially of the 
familiar class. The class was indicated by the 



 427 

visitor s failure to look for the bell ; for there was 
a bell, though it required a little research. In a 
moment the mystery was solved : the gentleman 
who stood smiling at him from the threshold 
could only be Gabriel Nash. Dormer had not 
seen this whimsical personage for several months, 
and had had no news of him beyond the general 
intimation that he was abroad. His old friend 
had sufficiently prepared him, at the time of their 
reunion in Paris, for the idea of the fitful in in 
tercourse ; and he had not been ignorant, on his 
return from Paris, that he should have had an 
opportunity to miss him if he had not been too 
busy to take advantage of it. In London, after 
the episode at Harsh, Gabriel had not reap 
peared : he had redeemed none of the pledges 
given the night they walked together to Notre 
Dame and conversed on important matters. He 
was to have interposed in Nick s destiny, but he 
had not interposed ; he was to have dragged him 
in the opposite sense from Mrs. Dallow, but there 
had been no dragging ; he was to have saved him, 
as he called it, and yet Nick was lost. This cir 
cumstance, indeed, constituted his excuse : the 
member for Harsh had rushed so to perdition. 
Nick had, for the hour, seriously wished to keep 
hold of him : he valued him as a salutary in 
fluence. Yet when he came to his senses, after 
his election, our young man had recognized that 
Nash might very well have reflected on the thank- 
lessness of such a slippery subject mi^ht have 



428  

considered that he was released from his vows. 
Of course it had been particularly in the event 
of a Liberal triumph that he had threatened to 
make himself felt ; the effect of a brand plucked 
from the burning would be so much greater 
if the flames were already high. Yet Nick had 
not held him to the letter of this pledge, and 
had so fully admitted the right of a properly con 
stituted aesthete to lose patience with him that 
he was now far from greeting his visitor with a 
reproach. He felt much more thrown on his de 
fense. 

Gabriel did not attack him, however. He 
brought in only blandness and benevolence and 
a great content at having obeyed the mystic 
vo i ce it was really a remarkable case of second 
sight which had whispered to him that the 
recreant comrade of his prime was in town. He 
had just come back from Sicily, after a southern 
winter, according to a custom frequent with him, 
and had been moved by a miraculous prescience, 
unfavorable as the moment might seem, to go 
and ask for Nick in Calcutta Gardens, where he 
had extracted from his friend s servant an ad 
dress not known to all the world. He showed 
Nick what a mistake it had been to fear a re 
proach from Gabriel Nash, and how he habitually 
ignored all lapses and kept up the standard only 
by taking a hundred fine things for granted. He 
also abounded more than ever in his own sense, 
reminding his friend how no recollection of him, 



 429 

no evocation of him in absence, could do him jus 
tice. You could n t recall him without seeming 
to exaggerate him, and then recognized, when 
you saw him, that your exaggeration had fallen 
short. He emerged out of vagueness (his Sicily 
might have been the Sicily of " A Winter s 
Tale "), and would evidently be reabsorbed in 
it ; but his presence was positive and pervasive 
enough. He was very lively while he lasted. 
His connections were with beauty, urbanity and 
conversation, as usual, but it was a circle you 
could n t find in the Court Guide. Nick had a 
sense that he knew " a lot of aesthetic people," 
but he dealt in ideas much more than in names 
and addresses. He was genial and jocose, sun 
burnt and romantically allusive. Nick gathered 
that he had been living for many days in a Sara 
cenic tower, where his principal occupation was 
to watch for the flushing of the west. He had 
retained all the serenity of his opinions, and 
made light, with a candor of which the only de 
fect was apparently that it was not quite enough 
a conscious virtue, of many of the objects of com 
mon esteem. When Nick asked him what he had 
been doing he replied, " Oh, living, you know ; " 
and the tone of the words seemed to offer them 
as a record of magnificent success. He made a 
long visit, staying to luncheon and after luncheon, 
so that the little studio heard, all at once, more 
conversation, and of a wider scope, than in the 
several previous years of its history. With much 



430  

of our story left to tell, it is a pity that so little 
of this rich colloquy may be transcribed here ; 
because, as affairs took their course, it marked 
really (if it be a question of noting the exact 
point) a turn of the tide in Nick Dormer s per 
sonal situation. He was destined to remember 
the accent with which Nash exclaimed, on his 
drawing forth sundry specimens of amateurish 
earnestness, " I say I say I say ! " 

Nick glanced round, with a heightened color. 
" They are pretty bad, eh ? " 

" Oh, you re a deep one," Nash went on. 

"What s the matter?" 

" Do you call your conduct that of a man of 
honor?" 

" Scarcely, perhaps. But when no one has 
seen them ! " 

"That s your villainy. C est de 1 exquis, du 
pur exquis. Come, my dear fellow, this is very 
serious it s a bad business," said Gabriel Nash. 
Then he added, almost with austerity: "You ll 
be so good as to place before me every patch of 
paint, every sketch and scrap, that this room con 
tains." 

Nick complied, in great good-humor. He 
turned out his boxes and drawers, shoveled forth 
the contents of bulging portfolios, mounted on 
chairs to unhook old canvases that had been 
severely " skied." He was modest and docile 
and patient and amused, and above all quite 
thrilled thrilled with the idea of eliciting a 



 431 

note of appreciation so late in the day. It was 
the oddest thing how, at present, in fact, he 
found himself attributing value to Gabriel Nash 
attributing to him, among attributions more 
confused, the dignity of judgment, the authority 
of intelligence. Nash was an ambiguous being, 
but he was an excellent touchstone. The two 
said very little for a while, and they had almost 
half an hour s silence, during which, after Nick 
had hastily improvised a little exhibition, there 
was only a puffing of cigarettes. The visitor 
walked about, looking at this and that, taking up 
rough studies and laying them down, asking a 
question of fact, fishing with his umbrella, on the 
floor, amid a pile of unarranged sketches. Nick 
accepted, jocosely, the attitude of suspense, but 
there was even more of it in his heart than in his 
face. So few people had seen his young work 
almost no one who really counted. He had been 
ashamed of it, never showing it, to bring on a 
conclusion, inasmuch as it was precisely of a con 
clusion that he was afraid. He whistled now 
while he let his companion take time. He 
rubbed old panels with his sleeve and dabbed 
wet sponges on surfaces that had sunk. It was a 
long time since he had felt so gay, strange as such 
an assertion sounds in regard to a young man 
whose bridal-day had, at his urgent solicitation, 
lately been fixed. He had stayed in town to be 
alone with his imagination, and suddenly, para 
doxically, the sense of that result had arrived 
with Gabriel Nash. 



432  

" Nicholas Dormer," this personage remarked 
at last, " for grossness of immorality I think I 
have never seen your equal." 

"That sounds so well that I hesitate to risk 
spoiling it by wishing it explained." 

" Don t you recognize in any degree the ele 
vated idea of duty ? " 

" If I don t grasp it with a certain firmness I 
am a great failure, for I was quite brought up in 
it," Nick said. 

" Then you are the wretchedest failure I know. 
Life is ugly, after all." 

" Do I gather that you yourself recognize obli 
gations of the order you allude to ? " asked Nick. 

"Do you gather ?" Nash stared. " Why, 
are n t they the very flame of my faith, the bur 
den of my song ? " 

" My dear fellow, duty is doing, and I inferred 
that you think rather poorly of doing that it 
spoils one s style." 

"Doing wrong, assuredly." 

" But what do you call right ? What s your 
canon of certainty there ? " 

" The conscience that s in us that charming, 
conversible, infinite thing, the intensest thing 
we know. But you must treat the oracle civ 
illy if you wish to make it speak. You must n t 
stride into the temple in muddy jack-boots, with 
your hat on your head, as the Puritan troopers 
tramped into the dear old abbeys. One must do 
one s best to find out the right, and your crimi- 



 433 

nality appears to be that you have not taken 
common trouble." 

" I had n t you to ask," smiled Nick. " But 
duty strikes me as doing something. If you are 
too afraid it may be the wrong thing, you may let 
everything go." 

" Being is doing, and if doing is duty, being is 
duty. Do you follow ? " 

" At a great distance." 

" To be what one may be, really and effica 
ciously," Nash went on, " to feel it and under 
stand it, to accept it, adopt it, embrace it that s 
conduct, that s life." 

" And suppose one s a brute or an ass, where s 
the efficacy ? " 

" In one s very want of intelligence. In such 
cases one is out of it the question does n t ex 
ist ; one simply becomes a part of the duty of 
others. The brute, the ass, neither feels, nor 
understands, nor accepts, nor adopts. Those fine 
processes in themselves classify us. They edu 
cate, they exalt, they preserve ; so that, to profit 
by them, we must be as perceptive as we can. 
We must recognize our particular form, the in 
strument that each of us each of us who carries 
anything carries in his being. Mastering this 
instrument, learning to play it in perfection - 
that s what I call duty, what I call conduct, what 
I call success." 

Nick listened with friendly attention, and the 
air of general assent was in ais face as he said : 
" Every one has it, then, this individual pipe ? " 



434  

" Every one, my dear fellow, is too much to 
say, for the world is full of the crudest remplis- 
sage. The book of life is padded, ah but padded 
a deplorable want of editing. I speak of every 
one that is any one. Of course there are pipes 
and pipes little quavering flutes for the con 
certed movements and big cornets-a-piston for the 
great solos." 

" I see, I see. And what might your instru 
ment be ? " 

Nash hesitated not a moment ; his answer was 
radiantly ready. "To speak to people just as I 
am speaking to you. To prevent, for instance, 
a great wrong being done." 

"A great wrong ? " 

" Yes to the human race. I talk I talk ; 
I say the things that other people don t, that they 
can t, that they won t," Gabriel continued, with 
his inimitable candor. 

" If it s a question of mastery and perfection, 
you certainly have them," his companion replied. 

" And you have n t, alas ; that s the pity of it, 
that s the scandal. That s the wrong I want to 
set right, before it becomes too public a shame. 
I called you just now grossly immoral, on account 
of the spectacle you present a spectacle to be 
hidden from the eye of ingenuous youth : that 
of a man neglecting his own fiddle to blunder 
away on that of one of his fellows. We can t 
afford such mistakes, we can t tolerate such li 
cense." 



 435 

" You think, then, I have a fiddle ? " asked 
Nick. 

" A regular Stradivarius ! All these things 
you have shown me are singularly interesting. 
You have a talent of a wonderfully pure strain." 

" I say I say I say ! " Nick exclaimed, 
standing in front of his visitor with his hands in 
his pockets and a blush on his smiling face, and 
repeating, with a change of accent, Nash s excla 
mation of half an hour before. 

" I like it, your talent ; I measure it, I appre 
ciate it, I insist upon it," Nash went on, between 
the whiffs of his cigarette. " I have to be accom 
plished to do so, but fortunately I am. In such 
a case that s my duty. I shall make you my 
business for a while. Therefore," Nash added, 
piously, " don t say I m unconscious of the moral 
law." 

"A Stradivarius? " said Nick, interrogatively, 
with his eyes wide open, and the thought in his 
mind of how different this was from having gone 
to Griffin. 



XXIV. 

GABRIEL NASH had plenty of further opportu 
nity to elucidate this and other figurative remarks, 
for he not only spent several of the middle hours 
of the day with his friend, but came back with 
him in the evening (they dined together at a lit 
tle foreign pothouse in Soho, revealed to Nick 
on this occasion) and discussed the great ques 
tion .far into the night. The great question was 
whether, on the showing of those examples of 
his ability with which the room in which they 
sat was now densely bestrewn, Nick Dormer 
would be justified in "really going in" for the 
practice of pictorial art. This may strike many 
of my readers as a limited and even trivial in 
quiry, with little of the heroic or the romantic 
in it ; but it was none the less carried to a very 
fine point by our clever young men. Nick sus 
pected Nash of exaggerating his encouragement 
in order to play a malign trick on the political 
world, at whose expense it was his fancy to di 
vert himself (without making that organization 
bankrupt assuredly), and reminded him that his 
present accusation of immorality was strangely 
inconsistent with the wanton hope expressed 
by him in Paris the hope that the Liberal 



 437 

candidate at Harsh would be returned. Nash 
replied, first, " Oh, I had n t been in this place 
then ! " but he defended himself more effectually 
in saying that it was not of Nick s having got 
elected that he complained : it was of his visible 
hesitancy to throw up his seat. Nick requested 
that he would n t speak of this, and his gallantry 
failed to render him incapable of saying, " The 
fact is I have n t the nerve for it." They talked 
then for a while of what he could do, not of what 
he could n t ; of the mysteries and miracles of 
reproduction and representation ; of the strong, 
sane joys of the artistic life. Nick made afresh, 
with more fullness, his great confession, that his 
private ideal of happiness was the life of a great 
painter of portraits. He uttered his thought 
about this so copiously and lucidly that Nash s 
own abundance was stilled, and he listened al 
most as if he had been listening to something 
new, difficult as it was to suppose that there could 
be a point of view in relation to such a matter 
with which he was unacquainted. 

" There it is," said Nick at last " there s 
the naked, preposterous truth : that if I were to 
do exactly as I liked I should spend my years 
copying the more or less vacuous countenances 
of my fellow-mortals. I should find peace and 
pleasure and wisdom and worth, I should find fas 
cination and a measure of success in it out of 
the din and the dust and the scramble, the world 
of party labels, party cries, party bargains and 



438  

party treacheries of humbuggery, hypocrisy and 
cant. The cleanness and quietness of it, the in 
dependent effort to do something, to leave some 
thing which shall give joy to man long after the 
howling has died away to the last ghost of an 
echo such a vision solicits me at certain hours 
with an almost irresistible force." 

As he dropped these remarks Nick lolled on 
a big divan, with one of his long legs folded up ; 
and his visitor stopped in front of him, after mov 
ing about the room vaguely and softly, almost on 
tiptoe, not to interrupt him. " You speak with 
the eloquence that rises to a man s lips on a 
very particular occasion : when he has, practi 
cally, what ever his theory may be, renounced 
the right and dropped, hideously, into the wrong. 
Then his regret for the right, a certain exquisite 
appreciation of it, takes on an accent which I 
know well how to recognize." 

Nick looked up at him a moment. " You Ve hit 
it, if you mean by that that I have n t resigned 
my seat and that I don t intend to." 

" I thought you took it only to give it up. 
Don t you remember our talk in Paris ? " 

"I like to be a part of the spectacle that 
amuses you, but I could scarcely have taken so 
much trouble as that for it." 

" But is n t it an absurd comedy, the life you 
lead ? " 

" Comedy or tragedy I don t know which ; 
whatever it is, I appear to be capable of it to 
please two or three people." 



 439 

" Then you can take trouble ? " said Nash. 

"Yes, for the woman I m to marry." 

" Ah, you re to marry ? " 

" That s what has come on since we met in 
Paris, and it makes just the difference." 

" Ah, my poor friend," smiled Gabriel, stand 
ing there, "no wonder you have an eloquence, 
an accent ! " 

" It s a pity I have them in the wrong place. 
I m expected to have them in the House of Com 
mons." 

" You will when you make your farewell speech 
there to announce that you chuck it up. And 
may I venture to ask who s to be your wife ? " 
Gabriel went on. 

" Mrs. Dallow has kindly consented. I think 
you saw her in Paris." 

" Ah, yes : you spoke of her to me, and I re 
member asking you if you were in love with her." 

"I wasn t then." 

Nash hesitated a moment. " And are you 
now ? " 

"Oh, dear, yes," said Nick. 

" That would be better, if it was n t worse." 

" Nothing could be better ; it s the best thing 
that can happen to me." 

"Well," said Nash, "you must let me very 
respectfully approach her. You must let me 
bring her round." 

" Bring her round ? " 

"Talk her over." 



440  

"Over to what? " Nick repeated his compan 
ion s words, a little as if it were to gain time, re 
membering the effect Gabriel Nash had produced 
upon Julia an effect which scantily ministered 
to the idea of another meeting. Julia had had 
no occasion to allude again to Nick s imperturb 
able friend ; he had passed out of her life at once 
and forever ; but there flickered up a vivid recol 
lection of the contempt he had led her to ex 
press, together with a sense of how odd she 
would think it that her intended should have 
thrown over two pleasant visits to cultivate such 
company. 

" Over to a proper pride in what you may do 
what you may do above all if she will help 
you." 

" I scarcely see how she can help me," said 
Nick, with an air of thinking. 

" She s extremely handsome, as I remember 
her : you could do great things with her." 

"Ah, there s the rub," Nick went on. "I 
wanted her to sit for me, this week, but she 
would n t." 

" Elle a bien tort. You should do some fine 
strong type. Is Mrs. Dallow in London ? " Nash 
inquired. 

" For what do you take her ? She s paying 
visits." 

" Then I have a model for you." 

" Then you have ? " Nick stared. " What 
has that to do with Mrs. Dallow s being away ? " 



 441 

" Does n t it give you more time ? " 

" Oh, the time flies ! " sighed Nick, in a manner 
that caused his companion to break into a laugh 
a laugh in which, for a moment, he himself 
joined, blushing a little. 

" Does she like you to paint ? " Nash contin 
ued, with one of his candid intonations. 

" So she says." 

"Well, do something fine to show her." 

" I d rather show it to you," Nick confessed. 

" My dear fellow, I see it from here, if you do 
your duty. Do you remember the Tragic Muse ? " 
Nash pursued, explicative!/. 

" The Tragic Muse ? " 

u That girl in Paris, whom we heard at the old 
actress s, and whom we afterwards met at the 
charming entertainment given by your cousin 
(is n t he ?) the secretary of embassy." 

" Oh, Peter s girl : of course I remember her." 

"Don t call her Peter s ; call her rather mine," 
Nash said, with good-humored dissuasiveness. 
"I invented her, I introduced her, I revealed 
her." 

" I thought, on the contrary, you ridiculed and 
repudiated her." 

As an individual, surely not; I- seem to my 
self to have been all the while rendering her ser 
vices. I said I disliked tea-party ranters, and so 
I do ; but if my estimate of her powers was below 
the mark she has more than punished me." 

" What has she done ? " asked Nick. 



442  

" She has become interesting, as I suppose you 
know." 

" How should I know ?" 

" You must see her, you must paint her," said 
Nash. "She tells me that something was said 
about it that clay at Madame Carre s." 

" Oh, I remember said by Peter." 

" Then it will please Mr. Sherringham you 11 
be glad to do that. I suppose you know all he 
has done for Miriam ? " 

" Not a bit. I know nothing about Peter s af 
fairs, unless it be, in general, that he goes in for 
mountebanks and mimes and that it occurs to me 
I have heard one of my sisters mention the 
rumor had come to her that he has been back 
ing Miss Rooth." 

" Miss Rooth delights to talk of his kindness ; 
she is charming when she speaks of it. It s to 
his good offices that she owes her appearance 
here." 

" Here ? Is she in London ? " Nick inquired. 

" D ou tombez-vous ? I thought you people 
read the papers." 

" What should I read, when I sit (sometimes !) 
through the stuff they put into them ? " 

" Of course I see that that your engagement 
at your own theatre keeps you from going to the 
others. Learn then," said Gabriel Nash, "that 
you have a great competitor, and that you are 
distinctly not, much as you may suppose it, the 
rising comedian. The Tragic Muse is the great 



THE TRAGIC MUSh. 443 

modern personage. Have n t you heard people 
speak of her, haven t you been taken to see 
her ? " 

" I dare say I ve heard of her ; but with a good 
many other things on my mind I had forgotten 
it." 

" Certainly I can imagine what has been on 
your mind. She remembers you, at any rate ; 
she repays neglect with sympathy. She wants to 
come and see you." 

"To see me?" 

" To be seen by you it comes to the same 
thing. She s worth seeing : you must let me 
bring her ; you 11 find her very suggestive. That 
idea that you should paint her she appears to 
consider it a sort of bargain." 

" A bargain ? What will she give me ? " Nick 
asked. 

"A splendid model. She is splendid." 

" Oh, then bring her," said Nick. 



XXV. 

NASH brought her, the great modern personage, 
as he had described her, the very next day, and 
it took Nick Dormer but a short time to appre 
ciate his declaration that Miriam Rooth was 
splendid. She had made an impression upon 
him ten months before, but it had haunted him 
only for a day, immediately overlaid with other 
images. Yet after Nash had spoken of her a few 
moments he evoked her again ; some of her atti 
tudes, some of her tones, began to hover before 
him. He was pleased in advance with the idea 
of painting her. When she stood there in fact, 
however, it seemed to him that he had remem 
bered her wrong : the brilliant young lady who 
instantly filled his studio with a presence that 
it had never known was exempt from the curi 
ous clumsiness which had interfused his former 
admiration of her with a certain pity. Miriam 
Rooth was light and bright and straight to-day 
straight without being stiff and bright without 
being garish. To Nick s perhaps inadequately 
sophisticated mind the model, the actress, were 
figures with a vulgar setting ; but it would have 
been impossible to show that taint less than his 
present extremely natural yet extremely distin- 



 445 

guished visitor. She was more natural even than 
Gabriel Nash (" nature " was still Nick s formula 
for his old friend), and beside her he appeared 
almost commonplace. 

Nash recognized her superiority with a frank 
ness that was honorable to both of them, testify 
ing in this manner to his sense that they were all 
three serious beings, worthy to deal with reali 
ties. She attracted crowds to her theatre, but to 
his appreciation of such a fact as that, important 
doubtless in its way, there were limits which he 
had already expressed. What he now felt bound 
in all integrity to express was his perception that 
she had, in general and quite apart from the 
question of the box-office, a remarkable, a very 
remarkable, artistic nature. He confessed that 
she had surprised him there ; knowing of her in 
other days mainly that she was hungry to adopt 
an overrated profession, he had not imputed to 
her the normal measure of intelligence. Now he 
saw he had had some talks with her that she 
was intelligent ; so much so that he was sorry 
for the embarrassment it would be to her. Nick 
could imagine the discomfort of having that sort 
of commodity to dispose of in such conditions. 
" She s a distinguished woman really a distin 
guished woman," Nash explained, kindly and 
lucidly, almost paternally ; "and the head you can 
see for yourself." 

Miriam, smiling, as she sat on an old Venetian 
chair, held aloft, with the noblest effect, that por- 



446  

tion of her person to which this patronage was 
extended, and remarked to Nick that, strange as 
it might appear, she had got quite to like poor 
Mr. Nash ; she could make him go about with 
her ; it was a relief to her mother. 

" When I take him she has perfect peace," the 
girl said ; " then she can stay at home and see 
the interviewers. She delights in that and I hate 
it, so our friend here is a great comfort. Of 
course ^.fcmme de theatre is supposed to be able 
to go out alone, but there s a kind of appearance, 
an added chic, in having some one. People think 
he s my companion ; I m sure they fancy I pay 
him. I would pay him rather than give him up, 
for it does n t matter that he s not a lady. He 
is one in tact and sympathy, as you see. And 
base as he thinks the sort of thing I do, he can t 
keep away from the theatre. When you re cele 
brated, people will look at you who, before, could 
never find out for themselves why they should." 

" When you re celebrated you become hand 
somer ; at least that s what has happened to you, 
though you were pretty, too, of old," Gabriel ar 
gued. " I go to the theatre to look at your head ; 
it gives me the greatest pleasure. I take up any 
thing of that sort as soon as I find it ; one never 
knows how long it may last." 

" Are you speaking of my appearance ? " Mir 
iam asked. 

" Dear no, of my own pleasure, the first fresh 
ness," Nash went on. "Dormer, at least, let me 



 447 

tell you in justice to him, has n t waited till you 
were celebrated to want to see you again (he 
stands there open-eyed) ; for the simple reason 
that he had n t the least idea of your renown. I 
had to announce it to him." 

"Haven t you seen me act?" Miriam asked, 
without reproach, of her host. 

" I 11 go to-night," said Nick. 

" You have your Parliament, have n t you ? 
What do they call it the demands of public 
life ? " Miriam continued : to which Gabriel Nash 
rejoined that he had the demands of private as 
well, inasmuch as he was in love he was on the 
point of being married. Miriam listened to this 
with participation ; then she said : "Ah, then, do 
bring your what do they call her in English? 
I m always afraid of saying something improper 
your future. I ll send you a box, under the 
circumstances ; you 11 like that better." She 
added that if he were to paint her he would have 
to see her often on the stage, would n t he ? to 
profit by the optique de la schie (what did they 
call that in English?), studying her and fixing his 
impression. Before he had time to respond to 
this proposition she asked him if it disgusted him 
to hear her speak like that, as if she were always 
posing and thinking about herself, living only to 
be looked at, thrusting forward her person. She 
often got sick of doing so, already ; but a la 
guerre comme a la guerre. 

"That s the fine artistic nature, you see a 



448  

sort of divine disgust breaking but in her," Nash 
expounded. 

" If you want to paint me at all, of course. 
I m struck with the way I m taking that for 
granted," Miriam continued. "When Mr. Nash 
spoke of it to me I jumped at the idea. I re 
membered our meeting in Paris and the kind 
things you said to me. But no doubt one 
ought n t to jump at ideas when they represent 
serious sacrifices on the part of others." 

" Does n t she speak well ? " Nash exclaimed 
to Nick. "Oh, she ll go far! " 

" It s a great privilege to me to paint you : 
what title in the world have I to pretend to such 
a model ? " Nick replied to Miriam. " The sac 
rifice is yours a sacrifice of time and good 
nature and credulity. You come, in your beauty 
and your genius, to this shabby place where I ve 
nothing to show, not a guarantee to offer you ; 
and I wonder what I ve done to deserve such a 
gift of the gods." 

" Does n t he speak well ? " Nash demanded, 
smiling, of Miriam. 

She took no notice of him, but she repeated to 
Nick that she had n t forgotten his friendly at 
titude in Paris : and when he answered that he 
surely had done very little she broke out, first 
resting her eyes on him a moment with a deep, 
reasonable smile and then springing up quickly : 
" Ah, well, if I must justify myself, I liked you ! " 

" Fancy my appearing to challenge you ! " 



 449 

laughed Nick. " To see you again is to want 
tremendously to try something ; but you must 
have an infinite patience, because I m an awful 
duffer." . 

Miriam looked round the walls. " I see what 
you have done bien des choses" 

" She understands she understands," Gabriel 
dropped. And he added to Miriam : " Imagine, 
when he might do something, his choosing a life 
of shams ! At bottom he s like you a wonder 
ful artistic nature." 

" I 11 have patience," said the girl, smiling at 
Nick. 

" Then, my children, I leave you the peace 
of the Lord be with you." With these words 
Nash took his departure. 

The others chose a position for Miriam s sit 
ting, after she had placed herself in many differ 
ent attitudes and different lights ; but an hour 
had elapsed before Nick got to work began, on 
a large canvas, to "knock her in," as he called it. 
He was hindered a little even by a certain ner 
vousness, the emotion of finding himself, out of 
a clear sky, confronted with such a sitter and 
launched in such a task. The situation was in 
congruous, just after he had formally renounced 
all manner of " art " the renunciation taking 
effect not a bit the less from the whim that he 
had consciously treated himself to as a whim (the 
last he should ever indulge), the freak of re 
lapsing for a fortnight into a fingering of old 



450  

sketches, for the purpose, as he might have said, 
of burning them up, of clearing out his studio 
and terminating his lease. There were both 
embarrassment and inspiration in the strange 
chance of snatching back, for an hour, a relin 
quished joy : the jump with which he found he 
could still rise to such an occasion took away his 
breath a little, at the same time that the idea - 
the idea of what one might make of such mate 
rial touched him with an irresistible wand. On 
the spot, to his inner vision, Miriam became a 
magnificent result, drawing a hundred formative 
instincts out of their troubled sleep, defying him 
where he privately felt strongest and imposing 
herself triumphantly in her own strength. He 
had the good fortune to see her, as a subject, 
without striking matches, in a vivid light, and 
his quick attempt was as exciting as a sudden 
gallop it was almost the sense of riding a run 
away horse. 

She was, in her way, so fine that he could only 
think how to " do " her : that hard calculation 
soon flattened out the consciousness, lively in 
him at first, that she was a beautiful woman who 
had sought him out in his retirement. At the 
end of their first sitting her having sought him 
out appeared the most natural thing in the 
world : he had a perfect right to entertain her 
there explanations and complications were en 
gulfed in the productive mood. The business of 
"knocking her in " held up a lamp to her beauty, 



 451 

showed him how much there was of it and that 
she was infinitely interesting. He did n t want 
to fall in love with her (that would be a sell ! as 
he said to himself), and she promptly became 
much too interesting for that. Nick might have 
reflected, for simplification s sake, as his cousin 
Peter had done, but with more validity, that he 
was engaged with Miss Rooth in an undertaking 
that did n t in the least refer to themselves, that 
they were working together seriously and that 
work was a suspension of sensibility. But after 
her first sitting (she came, poor girl, but twice), 
the need of such exorcisms passed from his 
spirit: he had so thoroughly, practically taken her 
up. As to whether Miriam had the same bright, 
still sense of cooperation to a definite end, the 
sense of the distinctively technical nature of the 
answer to every question to which the occasion 
might give birth, that mystery would be cleared 
up only if it were open to us to regard this young 
lady through some other medium than the mind 
of her friends. We have chosen, as it happens, 
for some of the advantages it carries with it, the 
indirect vision ; and it fails as yet to tell us (what 
Nick of course wondered about before he ceased 
to care, as indeed he intimated to his visitor) why 
a young person crowned with success should 
have taken it into her head that there was some 
thing for her in so blighted a spot. She should 
have gone to one of the regular people, the great 
people : they would have welcomed her with open 



452  

arms. When Nick asked her if some of the R. 
A. s had n t expressed a desire to have a crack at 
her, she said : " Oh, dear, no, only the tiresome 
photographers ; and fancy them, in the future. 
If mamma could only do that for me!" And 
she added, with the charming fellowship for 
which she was conspicuous on this occasion : 
" You know I don t think any one yet has been 
quite so much struck with me as you." 

" Not even Peter Sherringham ? " asked Nick, 
laughing and stepping back to judge of the effect 
of a line. 

" Oh, Mr. Sherringham s different. You re 
an artist." 

" For Heaven s sake, don t say that ! " cried 
Nick. "And as regards your art, I thought 
Peter knew more than any one." 

" Ah, you re severe," said Miriam. 

" Severe ? " 

" Because that s what he thinks. But he does 
know a lot he has been a providence to me." 

" And why has n t he come here to see you 
act ? " 

Miriam hesitated a moment. " How do you 
know hie has n t come ? " 

" Because I take for granted he would have 
called on me if he had." 

" Does he like you very much ? " asked Miriam. 

"I don t know. I like him." 

" He s a gentleman pour cela" said Miriam. 

" Oh, yes, for that ! " Nick went on absently, 
sketching hard. 



7 HE TRAGIC MUSE. 453 

" Bat he s afraid of me afraid to see me." 

" Does n t he think you re good enough ? " 

" On the contrary he believes I shall carry 
him away and he s in a terror of my doing it." 

" He ought to like that," said Nick. 

" That s what I mean when I say he s not an 
artist. However, he declares he does like it, only 
it appears it is not the right thing for him. Oh, 
the right thing he s bent upon getting that. 
But it s not for me to blame him, for I am too. 
He s coming, some night, however : he shall have 
a dose ! " 

" Poor Peter ! " Nick exclaimed, with a compas 
sion none the less real because it was mirthful : 
the girl s tone was so expressive of good-humored, 
unscrupulous power. 

"He s such a curious mixture," Miriam went 
on ; " sometimes I lose patience with him. It 
is n t exactly trying to serve both God and Mam 
mon, but it s muddling up the. stage and the 
world. The world be hanged ; the stage, or any 
thing of that sort (I mean one s faith), comes 
first." 

" Brava, brava ! you do me good," Nick mur 
mured, still hilarious and at his work. " But it s 
very kind of you, when I was in this absurd state 
of ignorance, to attribute to me the honor of 
having been more struck with you than any one 
else," he continued, after a moment. 

" Yes, I confess I don t quite see when the 
shops were full of my photographs." 



454  

" Oh, I m so poor I don t go into shops," 
returned Nick. 

" Are you very poor ? " 

" I live on alms." 

"And don t they pay you the government, 
the ministry ?" 

" Dear young lady, for vrtiat ? for shutting 
myself up with beautiful women ? " 

" Ah, you have others, then ? " asked Miriam. 

"They are not so kind as you, I confess." 

" I 11 buy it from you what you re doing : 
I 11 pay you well, when it s done," said the girl. 
" I ve got money now ; I make it, you know a 
good lot of it. It s too delightful, after scraping 
and starving. Try it and you 11 see. Give up 
the base, bad world." 

" But is n t it supposed to be the base, bad 
world that pays ? " 

" Precisely ; make it pay, without mercy 
squeeze it dry. That s what it s meant for to 
pay for art. Ah, if it was n t for that ! I 11 bring 
you a quantity of photographs, to-morrow you 
must let me come back to-morrow : it s so amus 
ing to have them, by the hundred, all for nothing, 
to give away. That s what takes mamma most : 
she can t get over it. That s luxury and glory ; 
even at Castle Nugent they did n t do that. 
People used to sketch me, but not so much as 
mamma vent bien le dire ; and in all my life I 
never had but one poor little cartc-de-visite&gt; when 
I was sixteen, in a plaid frock, with the banks of 
a river, at three francs the dozen." 



XXVI. 

IT was success, Nick felt, that had made Mir 
iam finer the full possession of her talent and 
the sense of the recognition of it. There was an 
intimation in her presence (if he had given his 
mind to it) that for him too the same cause would 
produce the same effect that is, would show him 
that there is nothing like being launched in the 
practice of an art to learn what it may do for one. 
Nick felt clumsy beside a person who manifestly, 
now, had such an extraordinary familiarity with 
the point of view. He remembered, too, the 
clumsiness that had been in his visitor some 
thing clumsy and shabby, of quite another quality 
from her actual smartness, as London people 
would call it, her well-appointedness and her evi 
dent command of more than one manner. Hand 
some as she had been the year before, she had 
suggested provincial lodgings, bread and butter, 
heavy tragedy and tears ; and if then she was an 
ill-dressed girl with thick hair, who wanted to be 
an actress, she was already, in a few weeks, an 
actress who could act even at not acting. She 
showed what a light hand she could have, forbore 
to startle and looked as well, for unprofessional 
life, as Julia : which was only the perfection of 
her professional character. 



 

This function came out much in her talk, for 
there were many little bursts of confidence as 
well as many familiar pauses as she sat there ; 
and she was ready to tell Nick the whole history 
of her Mia thQ chance that had suddenly 
turned up and that she had caught, with a jump, 
as it passed. He missed some of the details, in 
his attention to his own task, and some of them 
he failed to understand, attached as they were to 
the name of Mr. Basil Dashwood, which he heard 
for the first time. It was through Mr. Dash- 
wood s extraordinary exertions that a hearing - 
a morning performance at a London theatre - 
had been obtained for her. That had been the 
great step, for it had led to the putting on at 
night of the play, at the same theatre, in place of 
a wretched thing they were trying (it was no use) 
to keep on its feet, and to her engagement for the 
principal part. She had made a hit in it (she 
could n t pretend not to know that) ; but she was 
already tired of it, there were so many other 
things she wanted to do ; and when she thought 
it would probably run a month or two more she 
was in the humor to curse the odious conditions 
of artistic production in such an age. The play 
was a simplified version of a new French piece, 
a thing that had taken in Paris, at a third-rate 
theatre, and had now, in London, proved itself 
good enough for houses mainly made up of ten- 
shilling stalls. It was Dashwood who had said 
it would go, if they could get the rights and a 



 



fellow to make some changes : he had discovered 
it at a nasty little theatre she had never been to, 
over the Seine. They had got the rights, and the 
fellow who had made the changes was practically 
Dashwood himself; there was another man, in 
London, Mr. Gushmore Miriam didn t know 
whether Nick would ever have heard of him 
(Nick had n t) who had done some of it. It had 
been awfully chopped down, to a mere bone, with 
the meat all gone ; but that was what people in 
London seemed to like. They were very inno 
cent, like little dogs amusing themselves with a 
bone. At any rate, she had made something, she 
had made a figure, of the woman (a dreadful idiot, 
really, especially in what Dashwood had muddled 
her into) ; and Miriam added, in the complacency 
of her young expansion : " Oh, give me fifty words, 
any time, and the ghost of a situation, and I 11 
set you up a figure. Besides, I mustn t abuse 
poor Yolande she has saved us," she said. 
" Yolande ? " 

" Our ridiculous play. That s the name of the 
impossible woman. She has put bread into our 
mouths and she s a loaf on the shelf for the fu 
ture. The rights are mine." 

" You re lucky to have them," said Nick a little 
vaguely, troubled about his sitter s nose, which 
was, somehow, Jewish without the convex arch. 

" Indeed I am. He gave them to me. Was n t 
it charming ? " 

" He gave them Mr. Dashwood? " 



45 8  

" Dear me, no ; where should poor Dashwood 
have got them ? He has n t a penny in the world. 
Besides, if he had got them he would have kept 
them. I mean your blessed cousin." 

" I see they re a present from Peter." 

" Like many other things. Isn t he a dear? 
If it had n t been for him the shelf would have 
remained bare. He bought the play for this 
country and America for four hundred pounds, and 
on the chance : fancy ! There was no rush for it, 
and how could he tell ? And then he gracefully 
handed it to me. So I have my little capital. 
Isn t he a duck ? You have nice cousins." 

Nick assented to the proposition, only putting 
in an amendment to the effect that surely Peter 
had nice cousins also, and making, as he went on 
with his work, a tacit preoccupied reflection or 
two ; such as that it must be pleasant to render 
little services like that to youth, beauty and gen 
ius (he rather wondered how Peter could afford 
them), and that, " duck " as he was, Miss Rooth s 
benefactor was rather taken for granted. Sic vos 
11011 vobis faintly murmured itself in Nick s brain. 
This community of interests, or at least of rela 
tions, quickened the flight of time, so that he was 
still fresh when the sitting came to an end. It 
was settled that Miriam should come back on the 
morrow, to enable her portrayer to make the 
most of the few days of the parliamentary recess ; 
and just before she left him she asked 

" Then you will come to-night ? " 



 459 

" Without fail. I hate to lose an hour of you." 

"Then I 11 place you. It will be my affair." 

"You re very kind," he responded. "Isn t it 
a simple matter for me to take a stall ? This 
week, I suppose, they re to be had." 

" I 11 send you a box," said Miriam. "You 
shall do it well. There are plenty now." 

" Why should I be lost, all alone, in the gran 
deur of a box ? " 

" Can t you bring your friend ? " 

" My friend ? " 

" The lady you are engaged to." 

" Unfortunately she is out of town." 

Miriam looked at him with a grand profundity. 
" Does she leave you alone like that ? " 

"She thought I should like it I should be 
more free to paint. You see I am." 

" Yes, perhaps it s good for me. Have you 
got her portrait ? " Miriam asked. 

" She does n t like me to paint her." 

"Really? Perhaps, then, she won t like you 
to paint me." 

"That s why I want to be quick," laughed 
Nick. 

" Before she knows it ? " 

" She 11 know it to-morrow. I shall write to 
her." 

Miriam gave him another of her special looks ; 
then she said, " I see you re afraid of her." And 
she added, " Mention my name ; they 11 give you 
the box at the theatre." 



460  

Whether or no Nick were afraid of Mrs. Dal- 
low, he still protested against receiving this 
bounty from the hands of Miss Rooth repeated 
that he would rather take a stall, according to his 
wont, and pay for it. This led her to declare 
with a sudden flicker of passion that if he did n t 
do as she wished she would never sit to him 
again. 

" Ah, then you have me," returned Nick. 
" Only I dorit see why you should give me so 
many things." 

" What in the world have I given you ? " 

" Why, an idea." And Nick looked at his pic 
ture a little ruefully. " I don t mean to say I 
have n t let it fall and smashed it." 

" Ah, an idea that is a great thing for people 
in our line. But you 11 see me much better from 
the box, and I 11 send you Gabriel Nash," Miriam 
added, getting into the hansom which her host s 
servant had fetched for her. As Nick turned 
back into his studio after watching her drive 
away, he laughed at the conception that they 
were in the same " line." 

Nick shared his box at the theatre with Ga 
briel Nash, who talked during the entr actes, not 
in the least about the performance or the per 
former, but about the possible greatness of the 
art of the portraitist its reach, its range, its 
fascination, the magnificent examples it had left 
us in the past : windows open into history, into 
psychology, things that were among the most 



 4 6j 

precious possessions of the human race. He 
insisted, above all, on the interest, the richness 
arising from this great peculiarity of it ; that, un 
like most other forms, it was a revelation of two 
realities, the man whom it was the artist s con 
scious effort to reveal and the man (the inter 
preter) expressed in the very quality and temper 
of that effort. It offered a double vision, the 
strongest dose of life that art could give, the 
strongest dose of art that life could give. Nick 
Dormer had already become aware that he had 
two states of mind in listening to Gabriel Nash : 
one of them in which he laughed, doubted, some- 
times even reprobated, and at any rate failed to 
follow or to accept ; the other in which this con- 
templative genius seemed to take the words out 
of his mouth, to utter for him, better and more 
completely, the very things he was on the point 
of saying. Nash s saying them, at such moments, 
appeared to make them true, to set them up in 
the world, and to-night he said a good many, es 
pecially as to the happiness of cultivating one s 
own garden ; growing there, in stillness and free 
dom, certain strong, pure flowers that would 
bloom forever, long after the rank weeds of the 
hour were withered and blown away. 

It was to keep Miriam Rooth in his eye, for 
his object, that Nick had come to the play ; and 
she dwelt there all the evening, being constantly 
on the stage. He was so occupied in watching 
her face (for he now saw pretty clearly what he 



462  

should attempt to make of it) that he was con 
scious only in a secondary degree of the story she 
illustrated, and in regard to her acting, in partic 
ular, had mainly a surprised sense that she was 
extraordinarily quiet. He remembered her loud- 
ness, her violence in Paris, at Peter Sherringham s, 
her wild wails, the first time, at Madame Carre s ; 
compared with which her present manner was 
eminently temperate and modern. Nick Dor 
mer was not critical at the theatre ; he believed 
what he saw and had a pleasant sense of the in 
evitable ; therefore he would not have guessed 
what Gabriel Nash had to tell him that for 
Miriam, with her tragic cast and her peculiar at 
tributes, her present performance, full of actual 
ity, of light, fine indications and, in parts, of 
pointed touches of comedy, was a rare tour de 
force. It went on altogether in a register that he 
had not supposed her to possess ; in which, as he 
said, she did n t touch her capital, doing it wholly 
with her little savings. It gave him the idea that 
she was capable of almost anything. 

In one of the intervals they went round to. see 
her ; but for Nick this purpose was partly de 
feated by the wonderful amiability with which he 
was challenged by Mrs. Rooth, whom they found 
sitting with her daughter and who attacked him 
with a hundred questions about his dear mother 
and his charming sisters. She maintained that 
that day in Paris they had shown her a kindness 
she should never forget. She abounded also in 



 463 

gracious expressions in regard to the portrait he 
had so cleverly begun, declaring that she was so 
eager to see it, however little he might as yet 
have accomplished, that she should do herself the 
honor to wait upon him in the morning, when 
Miriam came to sit. 

"I m acting for you to-night," the girl said to 
Nick, before he returned to his place. 

" No, that s exactly what you are not doing," 
Nash interposed, with one of his intellectual su 
periorities. " You have stopped acting, you have 
reduced it to the least that will do, you simply 
are you are just the visible image, the picture 
on the wall. It keeps you wonderfully in focus. 
I have never seen you so beautiful." 

Miriam stared at this ; then it could be seen 
that she colored. " What a luxury in life to have 
everything explained ! He s the great explainer," 
she said, turning to Nick. 

He shook hands with her for good -night. 
"Well, then, we must give him lots to do." 

She came to his studio in the morning, but un 
accompanied by her mother; in allusion to whom 
she simply said, "Mamma wished to come, but 
I would n t let her." They proceeded promptly 
to business. The girl divested herself of her hat 
and coat, taking the position already established 
for her. After they had worked for more than 
an hour with much less talk than the day before, 
Nick being extremely absorbed and Miriam wear 
ing, in silence, the kindest, most religious air of 



464  

consideration for the sharp tension she imposed 
upon him at the end of this period of patience, 
pervaded by a holy calm, our young lady sud 
denly got up and exclaimed, " I say, I must see 
it ! " with which, quickly, she stepped down from 
her place and came round to the canvas. She 
had, at Nick s request, not looked at his work 
the day before. He fell back, glad to rest, and 
put down his palette and brushes. 

11 Ah, bien, c est tape!" Miriam cried, as she 
stood before the easel Nick was pleased with 
her ejaculation, he was even pleased with what 
he had done ; he had had a long, happy spurt and 
felt excited and sanctioned. Miriam, retreating 
also a little, sank into a high-backed, old-fash 
ioned chair that stood two or three yards from 
the picture ar.d reclined in it, with her head on 
one side, looking at the rough resemblance. She 
made a remark or two about it, to which Nick 
replied, standing behind her and after a moment 
leaning on the top of the chair. He was away 
from his work, and his eyes searched it with a 
kind of fondness of hope. They rose, however, 
as he presently became conscious that the door 
of the large room opposite to him had opened 
without making a sound and that some one stood 
upon the threshold. The person on the thresh 
old was Julia Dallow. 

As soon as he perceived her Nick wished he 
had posted a letter to her the night before. He 
had written only that morning. Nevertheless 



 465 

there was genuine joy in the words with which 
he bounded toward her " Ah, my dear Julia, 
what a jolly surprise ! " for her unannounced 
descent spoke to him above all of an irresistible 
desire to see him again sooner than they had ar 
ranged. She had taken a step forward, but she 
had done no more, stopping short at the sight of 
the strange woman, so divested of visiting-gear 
that she looked half undressed, who lounged fa 
miliarly in the middle of the room and over 
whom Nick had been still more familiarly hang 
ing. Julia s eyes rested on this embodied unex 
pectedness, and as they did so she grew pale 
so pale that Nick, observing it, instinctively 
looked back to see what Miriam had done to 
produce such an effect. She had done nothing 
at all, which was precisely what was embar 
rassing ; only staring at the intruder, motionless 
and superb. She seemed, somehow, in indolent 
possession of the place, and even in that instant 
Nick noted how handsome she looked ; so that 
he exclaimed somewhere, inaudibly, in a region 
beneath his other emotions, "How I should like 
to paint her that way ! " Mrs. Dallow transferred 
her eyes for a single moment to Nick s ; then 
they turned away away from Miriam, ranging 
over the room. 

" I ve got a sitter, but you must n t mind that ; 
we re taking a rest. I m delighted to see you," 
said Nick. He closed the door of the studio 
behind her ; his servant was still at the outer 



466  

door, which was open and through which he saw 
Julia s carriage drawn up. This made her ad 
vance a little further, but still she said nothing ; 
she dropped no answer even when Nick went on, 
with a sense of awkwardness : " When did you 
come back? I hope nothing has gone wrong. 
You come at a very interesting moment," he con 
tinued, thinking, as soon as he had spoken, that 
they were such words as might have made her 
laugh. She was far from laughing : she only 
managed to look neither at him nor at Miriam 
and to say, after a little, when he had repeated 
his question about her return : 

" I came back this morning I came straight 
here." 

"And nothing s wrong, I hope ? " 

" Oh, no everything s all right," she replied 
very quickly and without expression. She vouch 
safed no explanation of her premature return and 
took no notice of the seat Nick offered her; 
neither did she appear to hear him when he 
begged her not to look yet at the work on the 
easel it was in such a dreadful state. He was 
conscious, as he phrased it, that this request 
gave to Miriam s position, directly in front of his 
canvas, an air of privilege which her neglect to 
recognize in any way Mrs. Dallow s entrance or 
her importance did nothing to correct. But that 
mattered less if the appeal failed to reach Julia s 
intelligence, as he judged, seeing presently how 
deeply she was agitated. Nothing mattered, in 



 467 

face of the sense of danger which took possession 
of him after she had been in the room a few mo 
ments. He wanted to say, " What s the diffi 
culty ? Has anything happened ? " but he felt 
that she would not like him to utter words so in 
timate in presence of the person she had been 
rudely startled to find between them. He pro 
nounced Miriam s name to Mrs. Dallow and Mrs. 
Dallow s to Miriam, but Julia s recognition of 
the ceremony was so slight as to be scarcely per 
ceptible. Miriam had the air of waiting for some 
thing more before she herself made a sign ; and 
as nothing more came she continued to be silent 
and not to budge. Nick added a remark to the 
effect that Mrs. Dallow would remember to have 
had the pleasure of meeting Miss Rooth the year 
before in Paris, that day, at her brother Pe 
ter s ; to which Mrs. Dallow rejoined, " Ah, 
yes," without any qualification, while she looked 
down at some rather rusty studies, on panels, 
which were ranged along the floor, resting against 
the base of the wall. Her agitation was evidently 
a pain to herself ; she had had a shock of ex 
treme violence, and Nick saw that as Miriam 
showed no symptom of offering to give up her 
sitting her stay would be of the briefest. He 
wished Miriam would do something say she 
would go, get up, move about ; as it was she had 
the appearance of watching, from her point of 
vantage, Mrs. Dallow s discomfiture. He made 
a series of inquiries about Julia s doings in the 



468  

country, to two or three of which she gave an 
swers monosyllabic and scarcely comprehensible, 
while she turned her eyes round and round the 
room as if she were looking for something she 
could n t find for an escape, for something that 
was not Miriam. At last she said it was at 
the end of a very few minutes : 

" I did n t come to stay when you re so 
busy. I only looked in to see if you were here. 
Good-by." 

" It s charming of you to have come. I m so 
glad you Ve seen for yourself how well I m oc 
cupied," Nick replied, not unaware that he was 
very red. This made Mrs. Dallow look at him, 
while Miriam considered them both. Julia s eyes 
had something in them that he had never seen 
before a flash of fright by which he was him 
self frightened. "Of course I ll see you later," 
he added, laughing awkwardly, while she reached 
the door, which she opened herself and got out, 
without a good-day to Miriam. " I wrote to you 
this morning you ve missed my letter," he re 
peated behind her, having already given her this 
information. The door of the studio was very 
near that of the house, but before Mrs. Dallow 
had reached the street the visitors bell was set 
ringing. The passage was narrow and she kept 
in advance of Nick, anticipating his motion to 
open the street-door. The bell was tinkling still 
when, by the action of her own hand, a gentle 
man on the step stood revealed. 



 469 

" Ah, my dear, don t go ! " Nick heard pro 
nounced in quick, soft dissuasion and in the now 
familiar accents of Gabriel Nash. The rectifica 
tion followed more quickly still, if that were a 
rectification which scarcely improved the matter : 
" I beg a thousand pardons. I thought you were 
Miriam." 

Gabriel gave way, and Mrs. Dallow dashed out 
of the house. Her carriage, a victoria with a 
pair of horses who had got hot, had taken a turn 
up the street, but the coachman had already per 
ceived his mistress and was rapidly coming back. 
He drew dear.; not so fast, however, but that 
Gabriel Nash had time to accompany Mrs. Dallow 
to the edge of the pavement with an apology for 
the freedom into which he had blundered. Nick 
was at her other hand, waiting to put her into 
her carriage and freshly disconcerted by the en 
counter with Nash, who somehow, as he stood 
making Julia an explanation that she didn t listen 
to, looked less eminent than usual, though not 
more conscious of difficulties. Nick colored 
deeper and watched the footman spring down as 
the victoria drove up ; he heard Nash say some 
thing about the honor of having met Mrs. Dal 
low in Paris. Nick wanted him to go into the 
house ; he damned inwardly his want of delicacy. 
He desired a word with Julia alone as much 
alone as the two inconvenient servants would al 
low. But Nash was not too much discouraged 
to say : " You came for a glimpse of the great 



470  

model ? Does rit she sit ? That s what I wanted 
too, this morning just a look, for a blessing on 
the day. Ah, but ^2*, madam " 

Julia had sprung into the carriage while he 
was still speaking and had flashed out to the 
coachman a " Home ! " which of itself set the 
vehicle in motion. The carriage went a few 
yards, but while Gabriel, with a magnificent bow, 
turned away, Nick Dormer, with his hand on the 
edge of the hood, moved with it. 

" You don t like it, but I 11 explain," he said, 
laughing and in a low tone. 

" Explain what ? " Mrs. Dallow asked, still very 
pale and grave, but showing nothing in her voice. 
She was thinking of the servants. She could 
think of them even then. 

"Oh, it s all right. I ll come in at five," 
Nick returned, gallantly jocular, while the car 
riage rolled away. 

Gabriel had gone into the studio and Nick 
found him standing in admiration before Miriam, 
who had resumed the position in which she was 
sitting. 

" Lord, she s good to-day ! Is n t she good 
to-day ? " Nash broke out, seizing Nick by the 
arm to give him a certain view. Miriam looked 
indeed still handsomer than before, and she had 
taken up her attitude again with a splendid 
sphinx-like air of being capable of keeping it for 
ever. Nick said nothing, but he went back to 
work with a tingle of confusion, which proved, 



 47! 

in fact, when he resumed his palette, to be a 
sharp and, after a moment, a delightful stimulus. 
Miriam spoke never a word, but she was doubly 
grand, and for more than an hour, till Nick, ex 
hausted, declared he must stop, the industrious 
silence was broken only by the desultory dis 
course of Gabriel Nash. 



XXVII. 

NICK DORMER went to Great Stanhope Street 
at five o clock and learned, rather to his surprise, 
that Mrs. Dallovv was not at home to his sur 
prise because he had told her he would come at 
that hour, and he attributed to her, with a cer 
tain simplicity, an eager state of mind in regard 
to his explanation. Apparently she was not 
eager ; the eagerness was his own he was 
eager to explain. He recognized, not without a 
certain consciousness of magnanimity in doing 
so, that there had been some reason for her 
quick withdrawal from his studio, or at any rate 
for her extreme discomposure there. He had, a 
few days before, put in a plea for a snatch of 
worship in that sanctuary, and she had accepted 
and approved it ; but the worship, when the cur 
tain happened to blow back, proved to be that of 
a magnificent young woman, an actress with dis 
ordered hair, who wore in a singular degree the 
aspect of a person arrived to spend the day. The 
explanation was easy : it resided in the circum 
stance that when one was painting, even very 
badly and only for a moment, one had to have 
models. Nick was impatient to give it, with 
frank, affectionate lips and a full, jocose admis- 



 473 

sion that it was natural Julia should have been 
startled ; and he was the .12 ore impatient that, 
though he would not in the least have expected 
her to like finding a strange woman domesti 
cated, for the hour, under his roof, she had dis 
liked it even more than would have seemed prob 
able. That was because, not having heard from 
him about the matter, the impression was, for the 
moment, irresistible with her that a trick had 
been played her. But three minutes with him 
alone would make the difference. 

They would indeed have a considerable differ 
ence to make, Nick reflected, as minutes much 
more numerous elapsed without bringing Mrs. 
Dallovv home. For he had said to the butler that 
he would come in and wait (though it was odd 
she should not have left a message for him) : she 
would doubtless return from one moment to the 
other. Nick had of course full license to wait, 
anywhere he preferred ; and he was ushered into 
Julia s particular sitting-room and supplied with 
tea and the evening papers. After a quarter of 
an hour, however, he gave little attention to these 
beguilements, owing to the increase of his idea 
that it was odd that when she definitely knew he 
was coming she should not have taken more pains 
to be at home. He walked up and down and 
looked out of the window, took up her books and 
dropped them again, and then, as half an hour 
had elapsed, began to feel rather angry. What 
could she be about when, at a moment when Lon- 



474  

don was utterly empty, she could not be paying 
visits ? A footman came in to attend to the fire ; 
whereupon Nick questioned him as to the man 
ner in which Mrs. Dallow was probably engaged. 
The man revealed the fact that his mistress had 
gone out only a quarter of an hour before Nick 
arrived, and, as if he appreciated the opportunity 
for a little decorous conversation, gave him still 
more information than he asked for. From this 
it appeared that, as Nick knew, or could surmise, 
she had the evening before, from the country, 
telegraphed for the victoria to meet her in the 
morning at Paddington and had gone straight 
from the station to the studio, while her maid, 
with her luggage, proceeded in a cab to Great 
Stanhope Street. On leaving the studio, how 
ever, she had not come directly home ; she had 
chosen this unusual season for an hour s drive in 
the Park. She had finally reentered her house, 
but had remained up-stairs all day, seeing no one 
and not coming down to luncheon. At four 
o clock she had ordered the brougham for four 
forty-five, and had got into it punctually, saying 
" To the Park ! " as she did so. 

Nick, after the footman had left him, felt him 
self much mystified by Julia s sudden passion for 
the banks of the Serpentine, forsaken and foggy 
now, inasmuch as the afternoon had come on 
gray and the light was waning. She usually 
hated the Park and she hated a closed carriage. 
He had a discomfortable vision of her, shrunken 



 475 

into a corner of her brougham and veiled as if 
she had been crying, revolving round the solitude 
of the Drive. She had of course been deeply 
disconcerted, and she was nervous and upset : the 
motion of the carriage soothed her a-nd made her 
fidget less. Nick remembered that in the morn 
ing, at his door, she had appeared to be going 
home ; so she had turned into the Park on second 
thoughts, as she passed. He lingered another 
half hour, walked up and down the room many 
times and thought of many things. Had she 
misunderstood him when he said he would come 
at five ? Could n t she be sure, even if she had, 
that he would come early rather than late, and 
might she not have left a message for him, on the 
chance? Going out, that way, a few minutes be 
fore he was to come had even a little the air of a 
thing done on purpose to offend him ; as if she 
had been so displeased that she had taken the 
nearest occasion of giving him a sign that she 
meant to break. But were these the things that 
Julia did and was that the way she did them 
his fine, proud, delicate, generous Julia? 

When six o clock came poor Nick felt dis 
tinctly resentful ; but he stayed ten minutes 
longer, on the possibility that Mrs. Dallow would, 
in the morning, have understood him to mention 
that hour. The April dusk began to gather and 
the unsociability of her behavior, especially if she 
were still rumbling about the Park, became ab 
surd. Anecdotes came back to Nick, vaguely 



 

remembered, heard he could n t have said when 
or where, of poor artists for whom life had been 
rendered difficult by wives who wouldn t allow 
them the use of the living female model and who 
made scenes if, on the staircase, they encoun 
tered such sources of inspiration. These ladies 
struck him as vulgar and odious persons, with 
whom it seemed grotesque that Julia should have 
anything in common. Of course she was not his 
wife yet, and of course, if she were, he should 
have washed his hands of every form of activity 
requiring the services of the sitter; but even 
these qualifications left him with a capacity to 
shudder at the way Julia just escaped ranking 
herself with the Philistines. 

At a quarter past six he rang a bell and told 
the servant who answered it that he was going 
and that Mrs. Dallow was to be informed as soon 
as she came in that he had expected to find her 
and had waited an hour and a quarter for her. 
But he had just reached the doorstep, on his de 
parture, when her brougham, emerging from the 
evening mist, stopped in front of the house. 
Nick stood at the door, hanging back till she got 
out, allowing the servants to help her. She saw 
him she was not veiled, like his mental image 
of her ; but this did not prevent her from pausing 
to give an order to the coachman, a matter ap 
parently requiring some discussion. When she 
came to the door Nick remarked to her that he 
had been waiting an. eternity for her; to which 



 477 

she replied that he must not make a grievance to 
her of that she was too unwell to do justice to 
it. He immediately professed regret and sym 
pathy, adding, however, that in that case she had 
much better not have gone out. She made no 
answer to this there were three servants in the 
hall who looked as if they might understand at 
least what was not said to them ; only when he 
followed her in she asked if his idea had been to 
stay longer. 

" Certainly, if you re not too ill to see me." 

" Come in, then," Julia said, turning back after 
having gone to the foot of the stairs. 

This struck him immediately as a further re 
striction of his visit : she would not readmit him 
to the drawing-room or to her boudoir ; she would 
receive him in an impersonal apartment down 
stairs, in which she saw people on business. 
What did she want to do to him ? He was pre 
pared, by this time, for a scene of jealousy; for 
he was sure he had learned to read her character 
justly in feeling that if she had the appearance 
of a cold woman she had also on certain occasions 
a liability to extreme emotion. She was very 
still, but every now and then she would fire off a 
pistol. As scJon as Nick had closed the door she 
said, without sitting down : 

" I dare say you saw I did n t like that at 
all." 

" My having a sitter, that way ? I was very 
much annoyed at it myself," Nick answered. 



 

" Why were you annoyed ? She s very hand 
some," said Mrs. Dallow, perversely. 

" I did n t know you looked at her ! " Nick 
laughed. 

Julia hesitated a moment. " Was I very rude ? " 

" Oh, it was all right ; it was only awkward for 
me, because you did n t know," Nick replied. 

" I did know ; that s why I came." 

" How do you mean ? My letter could n t have 
reached you." 

" I don t know anything about your letter," 
said Mrs. Dallow, casting about her for a chair, 
and then seating herself on the edge of a sofa, 
with her eyes on the floor. 

" She sat to me yesterday ; she was there all 
the morning ; but I did n t write to tell you. I 
went at her with great energy and, absurd as it 
may seem to you, found myself very tired after 
wards. Besides, in the evening I went to see 
her act." 

" Does she act ? " asked Mrs. Dallow. 

" She s an actress : it s her profession. Don t 
you remember her that day, at Peter s, in Paris ? 
She s already a celebrity ; she has great talent ; 
she s engaged at a theatre here and is mak 
ing a sensation. As I tell you, 1* saw her last 
night." 

"You needn t tell me," Mrs. Dallow replied, 
looking up at him with a face of which the intense, 
the tragic sadness startled him. 

He had been standing before her, but at this 



 47 g 

he instantly sat down beside her, taking her pas 
sive hand. " I want to, please ; otherwise it must 
seem so odd to you. I knew she was coming 
when I wrote to you the day before yesterday. 
But I did n t tell you then, because I did n t know 
how it would turn out and I did n t want to exult, 
in advance, over a poor little attempt that might 
come to nothing. Moreover, it was no use speak 
ing of the matter at all unless I told you exactly 
how it came about," Nick went on, explaining 
kindly, copiously. " It was the result of a visit 
unexpectedly paid me by Gabriel Nash." 

That man the man who spoke to me ? " 
Julia asked, startled into a shuddering memory. 

"He did what he thought would please you, 
but I dare say it didn t. You met him in Paris 
and did n t like him ; so I thought it best to hold 
my tongue about him." 
"Do^tf// like him?" 
"Very much." 

" Great heaven ! " Julia ejaculated, almost un 
der her breath. 

"The reason I was annoyed was because, 
somehow, when you came in, I suddenly had the 
air of having got out of those visits and shut my 
self up in town to do something that I had kept 
from you. And I have been very unhappy till I 
could explain." 

"You don t explain you can t explain," Mrs. 
Dallow^ declared, turning on her companion eyes 
which, in spite of her studied stillness, expressed 



4 g  

deep excitement. "I knew it I knew every 
thing ; that s why I came." 

"It was a sort of second sight what they 
call a brain-wave," Nick smiled. 

" I felt uneasy, I felt a kind of call ; it came 
suddenly, yesterday. It was irresistible ; nothing 
could have kept me this morning." 

"That s very serious, but it s still more de 
lightful. You must n t go away again," said Nick. 
" We must stick together forever and ever." 

He put his arm round her, but she detached 
herself as soon as she felt its pressure. She rose 
quickly, moving away, while, mystified, he sat 
looking up at her as she had looked a few mo 
ments before at him. 

"I ve thought it all over ; I ve been thinking 
of it all day," she began. " That s why I did n t 
come in." 

"Don t think of it too much; it isn t worth 

it." 

"You like it more than anything else. You 
do you can t deny it," she went on. 

" My dear child, what are you talking about ? " 
Nick asked, gently. 

" That s what you like doing what you were 
this morning; with women lolling, with their 
things off, to be painted, and people like that 
man." 

Nick slowly got up, hesitating. "My clear 
Julia, apart from the surprise, this morning, do 
you object to the living model ? " 



 48 r 

"Not a bit, for you." 

" What s the inconvenience, then, since, in my 
studio, they are only for me ? " 

"You love it, you revel in it ; that s what you 
want, and that s the only thing you want ! " Julia 
broke out. 

"To have models, lolling women, do you 
mean ? " 

" That s what I felt, what I knew, what came 
over me and haunted me yesterday, so that I 
could n t throw it off. It seemed to me that if I 
could see it with my eyes and have the perfect 
proof I should feel better, I should be quiet. 
And now I am after a struggle of some hours, 
I confess. I have seen ; the whole thing s clear 
and I m satisfied." 

"I m not, and to me the whole thing isn t 
clear. What, exactly, are you talking about ? " 
Nick demanded. 

"About what you were doing this morning. 
That s your innermost preference, that s your 
secret passion." 

" A little go at something serious ? Yes, it 
was almost serious," said Nick. " But it was 
an accident, this morning and yesterday : I got 
on better than I intended." 

"I m sure you have immense talent," Mrs. 
Dallow remarked, with a joylessness that was al 
most droll. 

" No, no, I might have had. I Ve plucked it 
up : it s too late for it to flower. My dear Julia, 



4 82  

I m perfectly incompetent and perfectly re 
signed." 

&lt;k Yes, you looked so this morning, when you 
hung over her. Oh, she 11 bring back your 
talent ! " 

"She s an obliging and even an intelligent 
creature, and I ve no doubt she would if she 
could. But I ve received from you all the help 
that any woman is destined to give me. No one 
can do for me again what you have done." 

" I should n t try it again ; I acted in ignorance. 
Oh, I ve thought it all out ! " Julia declared. 
Then, with a strange face of anguish resting on 
his, she said, "Before it s too late before it s 
too late ! " 

"Too late for what?" 

" For you to be free for you to be free. 
And for me for me to be free too. You hate 
everything I like!" she exclaimed, with a trem 
bling voice. " Don t pretend, don t pretend ! " 
she went on, as a sound of protest broke from 
him. 

"I thought you wanted me to paint," protested 
Nick, flushed and staring. 

" I do I do. That s why you must be free, 
why we must part." 

" Why we must part ? " 

" Oh, I ve turned it over. I ve faced the 
truth. It would n t do at all," said Mrs. Dallow. 

" I like the way you talk of it, as if it were a 
trimming for your dress ! " Nick rejoined, with 



 483 

bitterness. " Won t it do for you to be loved 
and cherished as well as any woman in En-- 
land ? " 

Mrs. Dallow turned away from him, closing 
her eyes as if not to see something that would be 
dangerous to her. " You must n t give anything 
up for me. I should feel it all the while, and I 
should hate it. I m not afraid of the truth, but 
you are." 

" The truth, dear Julia ? I only want to know 
it," said Nick. " It seems to me I ve got hold of 
it. When two persons are united by the tender- 
est affection and are sane and generous and 
just, no difficulties that occur in the union their 
life makes for them are insurmountable, no prob 
lems are insoluble." 

Mrs. Dallow appeared for a moment to reflect 
upon this : it was spoken in a tone that might 
have touched her. At any rate, at the end of 
the moment, lifting her eyes, she announced : 
" I hate art, as you call it. I thought I did, I 
knew I did ; but till this morning I did n t know 
how much." 

"Bless your soul, that wasn t art," pleaded 
Nick. "The real thing will be a thousand miles 
away from us ; it will never come into the house, 
soyez tranqttille. Why then should you worry ? " 
" Because I want to understand, I want ^o 
know what I m doing. You re an artist : you 
are, you are ! " Mrs. Dallow cried, accusing him 
passionately. 



484  

" My poor Julia, it isn t so easy as that, nor a 
character one can take on from one day to the 
other. There are all sorts of things ; one must 
be caught young, and put through the mill and 
see things as they are. There would be sacrifices 
I never can make." 

" Well then, there are sacrifices for both of us, 
and I can t make them, either. I dare say it s 
all right for you, but for me it would be a terrible 
mistake. When I think I m doing something I 
must n t do just the opposite," Julia went on, as if 
she wished to explain and be clear. " There are 
things I ve thought of, the things I like best ; 
and they are not what you mean. It would be a 
great deception, and it s not the way I see my 
life, and it would be misery if we don t under 
stand." 

Nick looked at her in hard perplexity, for she 
did not succeed in explaining as well as she 
wished. " If we don t understand what ? " 

" That we are awfully different that you are 
doing it all for me." 

"And is that an objection to me what I do 
for you ? " asked Nick. 

" You do too much. You re awfully good, 
you re generous, you re a dear fellow ; but I 
don t believe in it. I did n t, at bottom, from the 
first that s why I made you wait, why I gave 
you your freedom. Oh, I ve suspected you. I 
had my ideas. It s all right for you, but it won t 
do for me : I m different altogether. Why should 



 485 

it always be put upon me, when I hate it ? What 
have I done ? I was drenched with it, before." 
These last words, as they broke forth, were ac 
companied, even as the speaker uttered them, 
with a quick blush ; so that Nick could as quickly 
discern in them the uncalculated betrayal of an 
old irritation, an old shame almost her late 
husband s flat, inglorious taste for pretty things, 
his indifference to every chance to play a public 
part This had been the mortification of her 
youth, and it was indeed a perversity of fate that 
a new alliance should contain for her even an 
oblique demand for the same spirit of accommo 
dation, impose on her the secret bitterness of the 
same concessions. As Nick stood there before 
her, struggling sincerely with the force that he 
now felt to be strong in her, the intense resolu 
tion to break with him, a force matured in a few 
hours, he read a riddle that hitherto had baffled 
him, saw a great mystery become simple. A 
personal passion for him had all but thrown her 
into his arms (the sort of thing that even a vain 
man and Nick was not especially vain might 
hesitate to recognize the strength of) ; held in 
check with a tension of the cord, at moments, of 
which he could still feel the vibration, by her 
deep, her rare ambition and arrested, at the last, 
only just in time to save her calculations. His 
present glimpse of the immense extent of these 
calculations did not make him think her cold or 
poor ; there was in fact a positive strange heat 



4 86  

in them and they struck him rather as grand and 
hi-h. The fact that she could drop him even 
while she longed for him drop him because it 
was now fixed in her mind that he would not af 
ter all serve her determination to be associated, 
so far as a woman could, with great affairs ; that 
she could postpone, and postpone to an uncer 
tainty, the satisfaction of a gnawing tenderness 
and judge for the long run this exhibition of 
will and courage, of the large plan that possessed 
her, commanded his admiration on the spot. He 
paid the heavy penalty of being a man of imagina 
tion ; he was capable of far excursions of the 
spirit, disloyalties to habit and even to faith, and 
open to wondrous communications. He ached, 
for the moment, to convince her that he would 
achieve what he would n t, for the vision of his 
future that she had tried to entertain shone be 
fore him as a bribe and a challenge. It seemed 
to him there was nothing he couldn t fancy 
enough, to be so fancied by her. Presently he 
said : 

" You want to be sure the man you marry will 
be prime minister of England. But how can you 
be sure, with any one ? " 

"I can be sure some men won t," Mrs. Dallow 
replied. 

"The only safe thing, perhaps, would be to 
marry Mr. Macgeorge," Nick suggested. 

" Possibly not even him." 

"You re a prime minister yourself," Nick 



 487 

answered. "To hold fast to you as I hold, to 
be determined to be of your party isn t that 
political enough, since you are the incarnation 
of politics ? " 

" Ah, how you hate them ! " Julia moaned. 
" I saw that when I saw you this morning. The 
whole place reeked of it." 

" My dear child, the greatest statesmen have 
had their distractions. What do you make of my 
hereditary talent ? That s a tremendous force." 

" It would n t carry you far." Then Mrs. Dai- 
low added, " You must be a great artist." Nick 
gave a laugh at the involuntary contempt of this, 
but she went on : " It s beautiful of you to want 
to give up anything, and I like you for it. I shall 
always like you. We shall be friends, and I shall 
always take an interest " 

He stopped her at this, made a movement 
which interrupted her phrase, and she suffered 
him to hold her hand as if she were not afraid of 
him now. " It is n t only for you," he argued, 
gently; "you re a great deal, but you re not 
everything. Innumerable vows and pledges re 
pose upon my head. I m inextricably committed 
and dedicated. I was brought up in the temple ; 
my father was a high priest, and I m a child 
of the Lord. And then the life itself when 
yon speak of it I feel stirred to my depths ; it s 
like a herald s trumpet. Fight with me, Julia 
not against me ! Be on my side, and we shall 
do everything. It is fascinating, to be a great 



488  

man before the people to be loved by them, to 
be followed by them. An artist is n t never, 
never. Why should he be ? Don t forget how 
clever I am." 

" Oh, if it was n t for that ! " she rejoined, 
flushed with the effort to resist his tone. She 
asked abruptly, " Do you pretend that if I were 
to die to-morrow you would stay in the House ? " 

"If you were to die ? God knows ! But you 
do singularly little justice to my incentives," Nick 
continued. " My political career is everything 
to my mother." 

Julia hesitated a moment ; then she inquired : 
" Are you afraid of your mother ? " 

" Yes, particularly ; for she represents infinite 
possibilities of disappointment and distress. She 
represents all my father s as well as all her own ; 
and in them my father tragically lives again. On 
the other hand, I see him in bliss, as I see my 
mother, over our marriage and our life of com 
mon aspirations ; though of course that s not a 
consideration that I can expect to have power 
with you." 

Mrs. Dallow shook her head slowly, even smil 
ing a little, with an air of recovered calmness and 
lucidity. " You 11 never huld high office." 

" But why not take me as I am ? " 

" Because I m abominably keen about that 
sort of thing; I must recognize it. I must face 
the ugly truth. I Ve been through the worst ; 
it s all settled." 



 489 

"The worst, I suppose, was when you found 
me this morning." 

" Oh, that was all right for you." 

" You re magnanimous, Julia ; but evidently 
what s good enough for me is n t good enough 
for you." Nick spoke with bitterness. 

" I don t like you enough that s the obsta 
cle," said Mrs. Dallow, bravely. 

" You did a year ago ; you confessed to it." 

" Well, a year ago was a year ago. Things are 
changed to-day." 

" You re very fortunate to be able to throw 
away a devotion," Nick replied. 

Julia had her pocket handkerchief in her hand, 
and at this she quickly pressed it to her lips, as 
if to check an exclamation. Then, for an in 
stant, she appeared to be listening as if for a 
sound from outside. Nick interpreted her move 
ment as an honorable impulse to repress the 
words, " Do you mean the devotion that I was 
witness of this morning ? " But immediately 
afterwards she said something very different : 
" I thought I heard a ring. I ve telegraphed for 
Mrs. Gresham." 

" Why did you do that ? " asked Nick. 

" Oh, I want her." 

He walked to the window, where the curtains 
had not been drawn, and saw in the dusk a cab 
at the door. When he turned back he said : 
" Why won t you trust me to make you like me, 
as you call it, better? If I make you like me 



490  

as well as I like you, it will be about enough, I 

think." 

" Oh, I like you enough, for your happiness. 
And I don t throw away a devotion," Mrs. Dallow 
continued. " I shall be constantly kind to you. 
I shall be beautiful to you." 

"You ll make me lose a fortune," declared 

Nick. 

Julia stared, then she colored. " Ah, you may 
have all the money you want." 

" I don t mean yours," he answered, flushing 
in his turn. He had determined, on the instant, 
since it might serve, to tell her what he had never 
spoken of to her before. " Mr. Carteret last year 
promised me a pot of money on the day I should 
stand up with you. He has set his heart on our 
marriage." 

" I m sorry to disappoint Mr. Carteret," said 
Julia. " I 11 go and see him. I 11 make it all 
right," she went on. Besides, you ll make a 
fortune by your portraits. The great men get a 
thousand, just for a head." 

" I m only joking," Nick returned, with som 
bre eyes that contradicted this profession. " But 
what things you deserve I should do ! " 
" Do you mean striking likenesses ? " 
" You do hate it ! Pushed to that point, it s 
curious," the young man audibly mused 

" Do you mean you re joking about Mr. Car- 
teret s promise ? " 

" No, the promise is real ; but I don t seriously 
offer it as a reason." 



 49 j 

" I shall go to Beauclere," said Mrs. Dallow. 
"You re an hour late," she added in a different 
tone ; for at that moment the door of the room 
was thrown open and Mrs. Gresham, the butler 
pronouncing her name, was ushered in. 

"Ah, don t impugn my punctuality ; it s my 
character ! " the useful lady exclaimed, putting a 
sixpence from the cabman into her purse. Nick 
went off, at this, with a simplified farewell- went 
off foreseeing exactly what he found the next day, 
that Mrs. Gresham would have received orders 
not to budge from her hostess s side. He called 
on the morrow, late in the afternoon, and Julia 
saw him, liberally, in pursuance of her assertion 
that she would be " beautiful " to him, that she 
had not thrown away his devotion ; but Mrs. 
Gresham remained, immutably, a spectator of 
her liberality. Julia looked at him kindly, but 
her companion was more benignant still ; so that 
what Nick did with his own eyes was not to 
appeal to Mrs. Dallow to see him for a moment 
alone, but to solicit, in the name of this luxury, 
the second occupant of the drawing-room. Mrs. 
Gresham seemed to say, while Julia said very 
little : " I understand, my poor friend, I know 
everything (she has toM me only her side, but 
I m so competent that I know yours too), and I 
enter into the whole thing deeply. But it would 
be as much as my place is worth to accommodate 
you." Still, she did not go so far as to give him 
an inkling of what he learned on the third day 



492  

and what he had not gone so far as to suspect - 
that the two ladies had made rapid arrangements 
for a scheme of foreign travel. These arrange- 
ments had already been carried out when, at the 
door of the house in Great Stanhope Street, the 
fact was imparted to Nick that Mrs. Dallow and 
her friend had started that morning for Pans. 



XXVIII. 

ON their way to Florence, Julia Dallow and 
Mrs. Gresham spent three days in Paris, where 
Peter Sherringham had as much conversation 
with his sister as it often befell one member of 
that family to have with another. That is, on 
two different occasions he enjoyed half an hour s 
gossip with her in her sitting-room at the hotel. 
On one of these occasions he took the liberty of 
asking her whether or no, definitely, she meant 
to marry Nick Dormer. Julia expressed to him 
that she was much obliged for his interest, but 
that Nick and she were nothing more than re 
lations and good friends. " He wants to marry 
you, tremendously," Peter remarked ; to which 
Mrs. Dallow simply made answer, " Well, then, 
he may want." 

After this they sat silent for some moments, 
as if the subject had been quite threshed out be 
tween them. Peter felt no impulse to penetrate 
further, for it was not a habit of the Sherringhams 
to talk with each other of their love-affairs ; and 
he was conscious of the particular deterrent that 
he and Julia had, in general, so different a way 
of feeling that they could never go far together 
in discussion. He liked her and was sorry for 



494  

her, thought her life lonely and wondered she 
did n t make a "great " marriage. Moreover, he 
pitied her for being without the interests and 
consolations that he had found substantial : those 
of the intellectual, the studious order he con 
sidered these to be, not knowing how much she 
supposed that she reflected and studied or what 
an education she had found in her political as 
pirations, regarded by him as scarcely more a 
personal part of her than the livery of her ser 
vants or the jewels George Dallow s money had 
bought. Her relations with Nick were unfath 
omable to him ; but they were not his affair. No 
affair of Julia s was sufficiently his to justify him 
in an attempt to understand it. That there 
should have been any question of her marrying 
Nick was the anomaly to him, rather than that 
the question should have been dropped. He 
liked his clever cousin very well as he was 
enough to have a vague sense that he might be 
spoiled by being altered into a brother-in-law. 
Moreover, though he was not perhaps distinctly 
conscious of this, Peter pressed lightly on Julia s 
doings, from a tacit understanding that in this 
case she would let him off as easily. He could 
not have said exactly what it was that he judged 
it pertinent to be let off from : perhaps from 
irritating inquiry as to whether he had given any 
more tea-parties for young ladies connected with 
the theatre. 

Peter s forbearance, however, did not bring 



 495 

him all the security he prefigured. After an in 
terval he indeed went so far as to ask Julia if 
Nick had been wanting in respect to her ; but 
this was a question intended for sympathy, not 
for control. She answered, " Dear, no though 
he s very provoking." Thus Peter guessed that 
they had had a quarrel, in which it did n t con 
cern him to interpose : he added the epithet and 
her flight from England together, and they made 
up, to his perception, one of the little magnified 
embroilments which do duty for the real in super 
ficial lives. It was worse to provoke Julia than 
not, and Peter thought Nick s doing so not par 
ticularly characteristic of his versatility for good. 
He might wonder why she did n t marry the 
member for Harsh, if the subject had come up ; 
but he wondered still more why Nick did n t 
marry her. Julia said nothing, again, as if to 
give him a chance to make some inquiry which 
would save her from gushing ; but as his idea 
appeared to be to change the subject, and as he 
changed it only by silence, she was reduced to 
resuming presently : 

" I should have thought you would have come 
over to see your friend the actress." 

"Which of my friends? I know so many ac 
tresses," Peter rejoined. 

"The woman you inflicted on us in this place 
a year ago the one who is in London now." 

" Oh, Miriam Rooth ? I should have liked to 
come over, but I have been tied fast. Have you 
seen her ? " 



496 , 

"Yes, I ve seen her." 

" Do you like her ? " 

"Not at all." 

" She has a lovely voice," Peter hazarded, after 
a moment. 

" I don t know anything about her voice 
I have n t heard it." 

" But she does n t act in pantomime, does 
she ? " 

" I don t know anything about her acting. I 
saw her in private in Nick Dormer s studio." 

" In Nick Dormer s studio ? What was she 
doing there ? " 

"She was sprawling over the room and staring 
at me." 

If Mrs. Dallow had wished to "draw" her 
brother, it is probable that at this point she sus 
pected she had succeeded, in spite of the care he 
took to divest his tone of everything like emotion 
in uttering the words : " Why, does he know 
her so well ? I did n t know." 

" She is sitting to him for her portrait ; at least 
she was then." 

" Oh, yes, I remember : I put him up to that. 
I m greatly interested. Is the portrait good ? " 

" I have n t the least idea I did n t look at it. 
I dare say it s clever," Julia added. 

" How in the world does Nick find time to 
paint?" 

" I don t know. That horrid man brought 
her." 



 497 

" What horrid man ?" Peter demanded. 
" The one Nick thinks so clever the vulgar 
little man who was at your place that day and 
tried to talk to me. I remember he abused 
theatrical people to me as if I cared anything 
about them. But he has, apparently, something 
to do with this girl." 

" Oh, I recollect him I had a discussion with 
him," Peter said. 

" How could you ? I must go and dress," 
Julia went on. 

" He was clever, remarkably. Miss Rooth and 
her mother were old friends of his, and he was 
the first person to speak of them to me." 

" What a distinction ! 1 thought him disgust 
ing ! " exclaimed Mrs. Dallow, who was pressed 
for time and who had now got up. 

"Oh, you re severe," said Peter; but as they 
separated she had given him something to think 
of. 

That Nick was painting a beautiful actress was, 
no doubt, in part at least, the reason why he was 
provoking and why his most intimate female friend 
had come abroad. The fact did not render him 
provoking to Peter Sherringham : on the con 
trary, Peter had been quite sincere when he 
qualified it as interesting. It became, indeed, 
on reflection, so interesting that it had perhaps 
almost as much to do with Sherringham s rush 
over to London as it had to do with Julia s com 
ing away. Reflection taught Peter, further, that 



498  

the matter was altogether a delicate one, and 
suggested that it was odd he should be mixed up 
with it in fact, when, as Julia s business, he had 
wished only to keep out of it. It was his own 
business a little too : there was somehow a still 
more pointed implication of that in his sister s 
saying to him the next day that she wished im 
mensely he would take a fancy to Biddy Dormer. 
She said more : she said there had been a time 
when she believed he had done so believed too 
that the poor child herself had believed the same. 
Biddy was far away the nicest girl she knew 
the dearest, sweetest, cleverest, best, and one of 
the prettiest creatures in England, which never 
spoiled anything. She would make as charming 
a wife as ever a man had, suited to any position, 
however high, and (Julia did n t mind mentioning 
it, since Peter would believe it whether she men 
tioned it or no) was so predisposed in his favor 
that he would have no trouble at all. In short, 
she herself would see him through she would 
answer for it that he would only have to speak. 
Biddy s life at home was horrid ; she was very 
sorry for her the child was worthy of a better 
fate. Peter wondered what constituted the hor- 
ridness of Biddy s life, and perceived that it 
mainly arose from the fact that Julia disliked 
Lady Agnes and Grace ; profiting comfortably 
by the freedom to do so conferred upon her by 
her having given them a house of which she had 
perhaps not felt the want till they were in pos- 



 499 

ses&on of it. He knew she had always liked 
Biddy, but he asked himself (this was the rest of 
his wonder) why she had taken to liking her so 
extraordinarily just now. He liked her himself 
-he even liked to be talked to about her and 
he could believe everything Julia said : the only 
thing that mystified him was her motive for sud 
denly saying it. He assured her that he was in 
finitely indebted to her for her expenditure of im 
agination on his behalf, but that he was sorry if 
he had put it into any one s head (most of all 
into the girl s own) that he had looked at Biddy 
with a covetous eye. He knew not whether she 
would make a good wife, but he liked her quite 
too much to wish to put such a ticklish matter to 
the test. She was surely not intended for cruel 
experiments. As it happened, he was not think- 
ing of marrying any one he had ever so many 
reasons against it. Of course one was never safe 
against accidents, but one could at least take pre 
cautions, and he didn t mind telling her that 
there were several he had taken. 

" I don t know what you mean, but it seems to 
me quite the best precaution would be to care for 
a charming, steady girl like Biddy," Mrs. Dallow 
replied. " Then you would be quite in shelter, 
you would know the worst that can happen to 
you, and it would n t be bad." The objection 
Peter had made to this argument is not impor 
tant, especially as it was not remarkably candid ; 
it need only be mentioned that before he and 



500  

Julia parted she said to him, still in reference to 
Bridget Dormer : " Do go and see her and be 
nice to her : she 11 save you disappointments." 

These last words reverberated in Sherring- 
ham s mind ; there was a shade of the portentous 
in them and they seemed to proceed from a larger 
knowledge of the subject than he himself as yet 
possessed. They were not absent from his 
memory when, in the beginning of May, avail 
ing himself, to save time, of the night-service, he 
crossed from Paris to London. He arrived be 
fore the breakfast hour and went to his sister s 
house in Great Stanhope Street, where he always 
found quarters, whether she were in town or not. 
If she were at home she welcomed him, and if 
she were not the relaxed servants hailed him for 
the chance he gave them to recover their "form." 
In either case his allowance of space was large 
and his independence complete. He had ob 
tained permission this year to take in fractions 
instead of as a single draught the leave of absence 
to which he was entitled ; and there was, more 
over, a question of his being transferred to an 
other embassy, in which event he believed that 
he might count upon a month or two in England 
before proceeding to his new post. 

He waited, after breakfast, but a very few min 
utes before jumping into a hansom and rattling 
away to the north. A part of his waiting indeed 
consisted of a fidgety walk up Bond Street, dur 
ing which he looked at his watch three or four 



 501 

times while he paused at shop windows for fear 
of being a little early. In the cab, as he rolled 
along, after having given an address, Balaklava 
Place, St. John s Wood, the fear that he should 
be too early took, curiously, at moments, the form 
of a fear that he should be too late : a symbol of 
the inconsistencies of which his spirit at present 
was full. Peter Sherringham was nervous, too 
nervous for a diplomatist, and haunted with in 
clinations, and indeed with purposes, which con 
tradicted each other. He wanted to be out of it 
and yet he dreaded not to be in it, and on this 
particular occasion the sense of exclusion made 
him sore. At the same time he was not uncon 
scious of the impulse to stop his cab and make it 
turn round and drive due south. He saw himself 
launched in the breezy fact while, morally speak 
ing, he was hauled up on the hot sand of the 
principle, and he had the intelligence to perceive 
how little these two faces of the same idea had 
in common. However, as the sense of movement 
encouraged him to reflect, a principle was a poor 
affair if it remained mere inaction. Yet from 
the moment it turned to action it manifestly could 
only be the particular action in which he was en 
gaged ; so that he was in the absurd position of 
thinking his behavior more consummate for the 
reason that it was directly opposed to his inten 
tions. 

He had kept away from London ever since 
Miriam Rooth came over ; resisting curiosity, 



502  

sympathy, importunate haunting passion, and 
considering that his resistance, founded, to be 
salutary, on a general scheme of life, was the 
greatest success he had yet achieved. He was 
deeply occupied with plucking up the feeling 
that attached him to her, and he had already, by 
various little ingenuities, loosened some of its 
roots. He suffered her to make her first appear 
ance on any stage without the comfort of his 
voice or the applause of his hand ; saying to him 
self that the man who could do the more could 
do the less and that such an act of fortitude was 
a proof he should keep straight. It was not ex 
actly keeping straight to run over to London three 
months later and, the hour he arrived, scramble 
off to Balaklava Place ; but after all he pretended 
only to be human and aimed, in behavior, only at 
the heroic, not at the monstrous. The highest 
heroism was three parts tact. He had not writ 
ten to Miriam that he was coming to England 
and would call upon her at eleven o clock in the 
morning, because it was his secret pride that he 
had ceased to correspond with her. Sherringham 
took his prudence where he could find it, and in 
doing so was rather like a drunkard who should 
flatter himself that he had forsworn liquor be 
cause he did n t touch lemonade. 

It is an example of how much he was drawn in 
different directions at once that when, on reach 
ing Balaklava Place and alighting at the door of 
a small much-ivied house which resembled a gate- 



 503 

lodge bereft of its park, he learned that Miss 
Rooth had only a quarter of an hour before 
quitted the spot with her mother (they had gone 
to the theatre, to rehearsal, said the maid who 
answered the bell he had set tinkling behind a 
dingy plastered wall) : when at the end of his pil 
grimage he was greeted by a disappointment he 
suddenly found himself relieved and, for the mo 
ment, even saved. Providence was after all tak 
ing care of him and he submitted to Providence. 
He would still be watched over doubtless, even 
if he should follow the two ladies to the theatre, 
send in his card and obtain admission to the his 
trionic workshop. All his old technical interest 
in the girl s development flamed up again, and 
he wondered what she was rehearsing, what she 
was to do next. He got back into his hansom 
and drove down the Edgware Road. By the time 
he reached the Marble Arch he had changed his 
mind again he had determined to let Miriam 
alone for that day. The day would be over at 
eight o clock in the evening (he hardly played 
fair), and then he should consider himself free. 
Instead of going to the theatre he drove to a 
shop in Bond Street, to take a place for the play. 
On first coming out he had tried, at one of those 
establishments strangely denominated "libraries," 
to get a stall, but the people to whom he applied 
were unable to accommodate him they had not 
a single seat left. His second attempt, at another 
"library," was more successful : he was unable to 



504  

obtain a stall, but by a miracle he might have a 
box. There was a certain wantonness in paying 
for a box to see a play on which he had already 
expended four hundred pounds; but while he was 
mentally measuring this abyss an idea came into 
his head which flushed the extravagance with a 
slight rose-tint. 

Peter came out of the shop with the voucher 
for the box in his pocket, turned into Piccadilly, 
noted that the day was growing warm and fine, 
felt glad that this time he had no business, unless 
it were business to leave a card or two on official 
people, and asked himself where he should go if 
he did n t go after Miriam. Then it was that it 
struck him as most acutely desirable, and even 
most important, that he should see Nick Dor 
mer s portrait of her. He wondered which would 
be the natural place at that hour of the day to 
look for the artist. The House of Commons was 
perhaps the nearest one, but Nick, incongruous 
as his proceedings certainly were, probably didn t 
keep the picture there ; and moreover it was not 
generally characteristic of him to be in the nat 
ural place. The end of Peter s debate was that 
he again entered a hansom and drove to Calcutta 
Gardens. The hour was early for calling, but 
cousins with whom one s intercourse was mainly 
a conversational scuffle would accept it as a prac 
tical illustration of that method. And if Julia 
wanted him to be nice to Biddy (which was ex 
actly, though with a different view, what he 



 505 

wanted himself), what could be nicer than to pay 
his visit to Lady Agnes (he would have in de 
cency to go to see her some time), at a friendly, 
fraternizing hour, when they would all be likely 
to be at home ? 

Unfortunately, as it turned out, they were 
not at home, so that Peter had to fall back on 
neutrality and the butler, who was, however, 
more luckily, an old friend. Her ladyship and 
Miss Dormer were absent from town, paying a 
visit ; and Mr. Dormer was also away, or was 
on the point of going away for the day. Miss 
Bridget was in London, but was out : Peter s in- 
formant mentioned with earnest vagueness that 
he thought she had gone somewhere to take a 
lesson. On Peter s asking what sort of lesson 
he meant, he replied, " Oh, I think a the 
a-sculpture, you know, sir." Peter knew, but Bid 
dy s lesson in "a-sculpture" (it sounded, on the 
butler s lips, like a fashionable new art) struck 
him a little as a mockery of the benevolent spirit 
in which he had come to look her up. The man 
had an air of participating respectfully in his dis 
appointment and, to make up for it, added that he 
might perhaps find Mr. Dormer at his other ad 
dress. He had gone out early and had directed 
his servant to come to Rosedale Road in an hour 
or two with a portmanteau : he was going down 
to Beauclere in the course of the day, Mr. Car- 
teret being ill perhaps Mr. Sherringham did n t 
know it. Perhaps, too, Mr. Sherringham would 



506  

catch him in Rosedale Road before he took his 
train he was to have been busy there for an 
hour. This was worth trying, and Peter imme 
diately drove to Rosedale Road ; where, in answer 
to his ring, the door was opened to him by Biddy 
Dormer. 



XXIX. 

WHEN Biddy saw him her cheek exhibited the 
prettiest pleased, surprised red that he had ever 
observed there, though he was not unacquainted 
with its fluctuations, and she stood still, smiling 
at him with the outer dazzle in her eyes, making 
no motion for him to enter. She only said, " Oh, 
. Peter ! " And then, " I m all alone." 

" So much the better, clear Biddy. Is that any 
reason I shouldn t come in ?" 

" Dear, no do come in. You ve just missed 
Nick ; he has gone to the country half an hour 
ago." She had on a large apron, and in her hand 
she carried a small stick, besmeared, as his quick 
eye saw, with modeling-clay. She dropped the 
door and fled back before him into the studio, 
where, when he followed her, she was in the act 
of flinging a cloth over a rough head, in clay, 
which, in the middle of the room, was supported 
on a high wooden stand. The effort to hide what 
she had been doing before he caught a glimpse 
of it made her redder still and led to her smiling 
more, to her laughing with a charming confusion 
of shyness and gladness. She rubbed her hands 
on her apron, she pulled it off, she looked delight 
fully awkward, not meeting Peter s eye, and she 



508  

said: "I m just scraping here a little you 
must n t mind me. What I do is awful, you know. 
Peter, please don t look. I ve been coming here , 
lately to make my little mess, because mamma 
does n t particularly like it at home. I ve had a 
lesson from a lady who exhibits ; but you would n t 
suppose it, to see what I do. Nick s so kind ; 
he lets me come here ; he uses the studio so little ; 
I do what I please. What a pity he s gone he 
would have been so glad. I m really alone I 
hope you don t mind. Peter, please don t look." 

Peter was not bent upon looking ; his eyes had 
occupation enough in Biddy s own agreeable as 
pect, which was full of an unusual element of 
domestication and responsibility. Though she 
had taken possession, by exception, of her bro 
ther s quarters, she struck her visitor as more at 
home and more herself than he had ever seen her. 
It was the first time she had been, to his vision, 
so separate from her mother and sister. She 
seemed to know this herself and to be a little 
frightened by it just enough to make him wish 
to be reassuring. At the same time Peter also, 
on this occasion, found himself touched with diffi 
dence, especially after he had gone back and 
closed the door and settled down to a regular 
visit ; for he became acutely conscious of what 
Julia had said to him in Paris and was unable to 
rid himself of the suspicion that it had been said 
with Biddy s knowledge. It was not that he sup 
posed his sister had told the girl that she meant 



 509 

to do what she could to make him propose to her : 
that would have been cruel to her (if she liked 
him enough to consent), in Julia s uncertainty. 
But Bidciy participated by imagination, by divina 
tion, by a clever girl s secret tremulous instincts, 
in her good friend s views about her, and this 
probability constituted for Sherringham a sort of 
embarrassing publicity. He had impressions, 
possibly gross and unjust, in regard to the way 
women move constantly together amid such con 
siderations and subtly intercommunicate, when 
they do not still more subtly dissemble, the hopes 
or fears of which persons of the opposite sex 
form the subject. Therefore poor Biddy would 
know that if she failed to strike him in the right 
light it would not be for want of his attention 
having been called to her claims. She would 
have been tacitly rejected, virtually condemned. 
Peter could not, without a slight sense of fatuity, 
endeavor to make up for this to her by kindness ; 
he was aware that if any one knew it a man 
would be ridiculous who should take so much 
as that for granted. But no one would know it : 
oddly enough, in this calculation of security he 
left Biddy herself out. It did not occur to him 
that she might have a secret small irony to spare 
for his ingenious and magnanimous impulse to 
show her how much he liked her in order to make 
her forgive him for not liking her more. This 
magnanimity, at any rate, colored the whole of 
Sherringham s visit to Rosedale Road, the whole 



510  

of the pleasant, prolonged chat that kept him 
there for more than an hour. He begged the 
girl to go on with her work, not to let him in 
terrupt it ; and she obliged him at last, taking 
the cloth off the lump of clay and giving him a 
chance to be delightful by guessing that the 
shapeless mass was intended, or would be in 
tended after a while, for Nick. He saw that she 
was more comfortable when she began to smooth 
it and scrape it with her little stick again, to 
manipulate it with an ineffectual air of knowing 
how ; for this gave her something to do, relieved 
her nervousness and permitted her to turn away 
from him when she talked. 

Peter walked about the room and sat down ; 
got up and looked at Nick s things ; watched her 
at moments in silence (which made her always 
say, in a minute, that he was not to look at her 
so, or she could do nothing) ; observed how her 
position, before her high stand, her lifted arms, 
her turns of the head, considering her work this 
way and that, all helped her to be pretty. She 
repeated again and again that it was an immense 
pity about Nick, till he was obliged to say he 
did n t care a straw for Nick : he was perfectly 
content with the company he found. This was 
not the sort of thing he thought it right, under 
the circumstances, to say ; but then even the 
circumstances did not require him to pretend he 
liked her less than he did. After all she was his 
cousin ; she would cease to be so if she should 



THE TRAGIC MU$. 511 

become his wife ; but one advantage of her not 
entering into that relation was precisely that she 
would remain his cousin. It was very pleasant 
to find a young, bright, slim, rose-colored kins 
woman all ready to recognize consanguinity when 
one came back from cousinless foreign lands. 
Peter talked about family matters ; he did n t know, 
in his exile, where no one took an interest in 
them, what a fund of latent curiosity about them 
was in him. It was in him to gossip about them 
and to enjoy the sense that he and Biddy had 
indefeasible properties in common ever so 
many things as to which they would understand 
each other a demi-mot. He smoked a cigarette 
because she begged him to, said that people 
always smoked in studios it made her feel so 
much more like an artist. She apologized for 
the badness of her work on the ground that Nick 
was so busy he could scarcely ever give her a 
sitting ; so that she had to do the head from 
photographs and occasional glimpses. They had 
hoped to be able to put in an hour that morning, 
but news had suddenly come that Mr. Carteret 
was worse, and Nick had hurried down to Beau- 
clere. Mr. Carteret was very ill, poor old dear, 
and Nick and he were immense friends. Nick 
had always been charming to him. Peter and 
Bidcly took the concerns of the houses of Dormer 
and Sherringham in order, and the young man 
felt after a little as if they were as wise as a 
French conseil de famille, settling what was best 



512  

for every one. He heard all about Lady Agnes 
and manifested an interest in the detail of her 
existence that he had not supposed himself to 
possess, though indeed Biddy threw out intima 
tions which excited his curiosity, presenting her 
mother in a light that might call upon his sym 
pathy. 

" I don t think she has been very happy or 
very pleased, of late," the girl said. "I think 
she has had some disappointments, poor dear 
mamma ; and Grace has made her go out of town 
for three or four days, for a little change. They 
have gone down to see an old lady, Lady St. 
Dunstans, who never comes to London now, and 
who, you know she s tremendously old was 
papa s godmother. It s not very lively for Grace, 
but Grace is such a dear she ll do anything for 
mamma. Mamma will go anywhere to see peo 
ple she can talk with about papa." 

Biddy added, in reply to a further inquiry from 
Peter, that what her mother was disappointed 
about was well, themselves, her children and 
all their affairs ; and she explained that Lady 
Agnes wanted all kinds of things for them that 
didn t come to them, that they didn t get or 
seem likely to get, so that their life appeared 
altogether a failure. She wanted a great deal, 
Biddy admitted ; she really wanted everything 
and she had thought in her happier days that 
everything was to be hers. She loved them all 
so much, and then she was proud : she could n t 



 513 

get over the thought of their not being success 
ful. Sherringham was unwilling to press, at this 
point, for he suspected one of the things that 
Lady Agnes wanted ; but Biddy relieved him a 
little by saying that one of these things was that 
Grace should get married. 

"That s too unselfish of her," rejoined Peter, 
who didn t care for Grace. " Cousin Agnes 
ought to keep her near her always, if Grace is so 
obliging and devoted." 

" Oh, mamma would give up anything of that 
sort for our good ; she would n t sacrifice us that 
way ! " Biddy exclaimed. " Besides, I m the one 
to stay with mamma ; not that I can manage and 
)ook after her and do everything so well as Grace. 
But, you know, I want to," said Biddy, with a 
liquid note in her voice, giving her lump of clay 
a little stab. 

" But does n t your mother want the rest of 
you to get married Percival and Nick and 
you ? " Peter asked. 

" Oh, she has given up Percy. I don t suppose 
she thinks it would do. Dear Nick, of course 
that s just what she does want." 

Sherringharn hesitated. " And you, Biddy ? " 
" Oh, I dare say ; but that does n t signify 
I never shall." 

Peter got up, at this ; the tone of it set him in 
motion and he took a turn round the room. He 
said something to her about her being too proud ; 
to which she replied that that was the only thing 
for a girl to be, to get on- 



514  

" What do you mean by getting on ? " Peter 
demanded, stopping, with his hands in his pock 
ets, on the other side of the studio. 

" I mean crying one s eyes out ! " Biddy unex 
pectedly exclaimed ; but she drowned the effect 
of this pathetic paradox in a foolish laugh and 
in the quick declaration : " Of course it s about 
Nick that poor mother s really broken-hearted." 

" What s the matter with Nick ? " Sherring- 
ham asked, diplomatically. 

"Oh, Peter, what s the matter with Julia?" 
Biddy quavered softly, back to him, with eyes 
suddenly frank and mournful. " I dare say you 
know what we all hoped what we all supposed, 
from what they told us. And now they won t !" 
said Biddy. 

" Yes, Biddy, I know. I had the brightest pros 
pect of becoming your brother-in-law : would n t 
that have been it or something like that ? But 
it is indeed visibly clouded. What s the matter 
with them ? May I have another cigarette ? " 
Peter came back to the wide, cushioned bench 
where he had been lounging: this was the way 
they took up the subject he wanted most to 
look into. Don t they know how to love?" he 
went on, as he seated himself again. 

" It seems a kind of fatality ! " sighed Biddy. 

Peter said nothing for some moments, at the 
end of which he inquired whether his companion 
were to be quite alone during her mother s ab 
sence. She replied that her mother was very 



 515 

droll about that she would never leave her 
alone : she thought something dreadful would 
happen to her. She had therefore arranged that 
Florence Tressilian should come and stay in Cal 
cutta Gardens for the next few days, to look after 
her and see she did no wrong. Peter asked who 
Florence Tressilian might be : he greatly hoped, 
for the success of Lady Agnes s precautions, that 
she was not a flighty young genius like Biddy. 
She was described to him as tremendously nice 
and tremendously clever, but also tremendously 
old and tremendously safe ; with the addition 
that Biddy was tremendously fond of her and 
that while she remained in Calcutta Gardens 
they expected to enjoy themselves tremendously. 
She was to come that afternoon, before dinner. 

" And are you to dine at home ? " said Peter. 

" Certainly ; where else ? " 

" And just you two, alone ? Do you call that 
enjoying yourselves tremendously ? " 

" It will do for me. No doubt I ought n t, in 
modesty, to speak for poor Florence." 

&lt;l It is n t fair to her; you ought to invite some 
one to meet her." 

"Do you mean you, Peter?" the girl asked, 
turning to him quickly, with a look that vanished 
the instant he caught it. 

" Try me ; I 11 come like a shot." 

" That s kind," said Biddy, dropping her hands 
and now resting her eyes on him gratefully. She 
remained in this position a moment, as if she 



516  

were under a charm ; then she jerked herself 
back to her work with the remark : " Florence 
will like that immensely." 

" I m delighted to please Florence, your de 
scription of her is so attractive ! " Sherringham 
laughed. And when the girl asked him if he 
minded if there were not a great feast, because 
when her mother went away she allowed her a 
fixed amount for that sort of thing and, as he 
might imagine, it wasn t millions when Biddy, 
with the frankness of their pleasant kinship, 
touched anxiously on this economical point (illus 
trating, as Peter saw, the lucidity with which 
Lady Agnes had had in her old age to learn to 
recognize the occasions when she could be con 
veniently frugal), he answered that the shortest 
dinners were the best, especially when one was 
going to the theatre. That was his case to-night, 
and did Biddy think he might look to Miss Tres- 
silian to go with him ? They would have to dine 
early ; he wanted not to miss a moment. 

" The theatre Miss Tressilian ? " Biddy 
stared, interrupted and in suspense again. 

" Would it incommode you very much to dine 
say at 7.15 and accept a place in my box ? The 
finger of Providence was in it when I took a box 
an hour ago. I particularly like your being free 
to go if you are free." 

Biddy became fairly incoherent with pleasure. 
"Dear Peter, how good you are ! They ll have 
it at any hour. Florence vyill be so glad." 



 517 

" And has Florence seen Miss Rooth ? " 

" Miss Rooth ? " the girl repeated, redder than 
before. He perceived in a moment that she had 
heard that he had devoted much time and atten 
tion to that young lady. It was as if she were 
conscious that he would be conscious in speaking 
of her, and there was a sweetness in her allow 
ance for him on that score. But Biddy was more 
confused for him than he was for himself. He 
guessed in a moment how much she had thought 
over what she had heard ; this was indicated by 
her saying vaguely, " No, no, I ve not seen her." 
Then she became aware that she was answering 
a question he had not asked her, and she went 
on : " We shall be too delighted. I saw her 
perhaps you remember in your rooms in Paris. 
I thought her so wonderful then ! Every one is 
talking of her here. But we don t go to the 
theatre much, you know : we don t have boxes 
offered us except when you come. Poor Nick is 
too much taken up in the evening. I ve wanted 
awfully to see her. They say she s magnifi 
cent." 

" I don t know," said Peter. " I haven t seen 
her." 

" You have n t seen her ? " 

" Never, Biddy. I mean on the stage. In pri 
vate, often yes," Sherringham added, consci 
entiously. 

" Oh ! " Biddy exclaimed, bending her face on 
Nick s bust again. She asked him no question 



518  

about the new star, and he offered her no further 
information. There were things in his mind that 
pulled him different ways, so that for some min 
utes silence was the result of the conflict. At 
last he said, after an hesitation caused by the pos 
sibility that she was ignorant of the fact he had 
lately elicited from Julia, though it was more 
probable she might have learned it from the same 
source : 

" Am I perhaps indiscreet in alluding to the 
circumstance that Nick has been painting Miss 
Rooth s portrait ? " 

" You are not indiscreet in alluding to it to me, 
because I know it." 

" Then there s no secret nor mystery about 
it ? " 

Biddy considered a moment. " I don t think 
mamma knows it." 

" You mean you have been keeping it from her 
because she would n t like it ? " 

" We re afraid she may think that papa would 
n t have liked it." 

This was said with an absence of humor which 
for an instant moved Sherringham to mirth ; but 
he quickly recovered himself, repenting of any 
apparent failure of respect to the high memory 
of his late celebrated relative. He rejoined 
quickly, but rather vaguely : " Ah, yes, I remem 
ber that great man s ideas ; " and then he went 
on : " May I ask if you know it, the fact that we 
are talking of, through Julia or through Nick ? " 



 519 

" I know it from both of them," 

" Then, if you re in their confidence, may I 
further ask whether this undertaking of Nick s 
is the reason why things seem to be at an end 
between them ? " 

" Oh, I don t think she likes it," returned 
Biddy. 

" Isn t it good ? " 

"Oh, I don t mean the picture she hasn t 
seen it ; but his having done it." 

" Does she dislike it so much that that s why 
she won t marry him ? " 

Biddy gave up her work, moving away from it 
to look at it. She came and sat down on the 
long bench on which Sherringham had placed 
himself. Then she broke out : " Oh, Peter, it s 
a great trouble it s a very great trouble ; and 
I can t tell you, for I don t understand it." 

" If I ask you, it s not to pry into what does n t 
concern me ; but Julia is my sister, and I can t, 
after all, help taking some interest in her life. 
But she tells me very little. She does n t think 
me worthy." 

" Ah, poor Julia ! " Biddy murmured, defen 
sively. Her tone recalled to him that Julia had 
thought him worthy to unite himself to Bridget 
Dormer, and inevitably betrayed that the girl was 
thinking of that also. While they both thought 
of it they sat looking into each other s eyes. 

" Nick, I m sure, doesn t treat you that way ; 
I m sure he confides in you ; he talks to you 



520  

about his occupations, his ambitions," Peter con 
tinued. " And you understand him, you enter 
into them, you are nice to him, you help him." 

" Oh, Nick s life it s very dear to me," said 
Biddy. 

"That must be jolly for him." 
" It makes me very happy." 
Peter uttered a low, ambiguous groan ; then he 
exclaimed, with irritation : " What the deuce is 
the matter with them then ? Why can t they hit 
it off and be quiet and rational and do what every 
- one wants them to do ? " 

" Oh, Peter, it s awfully complicated," said 
Biddy, with sagacity. 

" Do you mean that Nick s in love with her ? " 
" In love with Julia ? " 
" No, no, with Miriam Rooth." 
Biddy shook her head slowly ; then with a smile 
which struck him as one of the sweetest things 
he had ever seen (it conveyed, at the expense of 
her own prospects, such a shy, generous little 
mercy of reassurance): "He isn t, Peter," she 
declared. "Julia thinks it s trifling all that 
sort of thing," she added. "She. wants him to 
go in for different honors." 

"Julia s the oddest woman. I thought she 
loved him," Sherringham remarked. " And 
when you love a person - He continued to 
reflect, leaving his sentence impatiently unfin 
ished, while Biddy, with lowered eyes, sat waiting 
(it interested her) to learn what you did when 



 52! 

you loved a person. " I can t conceive her giv 
ing him up. He has great ability, besides being 
such a good fellow." 

It s for his happiness, Peter that s the 
way she reasons," Biddy explained. "She does 
it for an idea ; she has rold me a great deal about 
it, and I see the way she feels." 

" You try to, Biddy, because you are such a 
dear good-natured girl, but I don t believe you do 
in the least. It s too little the way you yourself 
would feel. Julia s idea, as you call it, must be 
curious." 

" Well, it is, Peter," Biddy mournfully admitted. 
" She won t risk not coming out at the top." 

"At the top of what ? " 

"Oh, of everything." Biddy s tone showed a 
trace of awe of such high views. 

" Surely one s at the top of everything when 
one s in love." 

" I don t know," said the girl. 

"Do you doubt it ?" Sherringham demanded. 

" I have never been in love and I never shall 
be." 

" You re as perverse, in your way, as Julia. 
But I confess I don t understand Nick s attitude 
any better. He seems to me, if I may say so, 
neither fish nor flesh." 

"Oh, his attitude is very noble, Peter; his 
state of mind is wonderfully interesting," Biddy 
pleaded. " Surely you musf be in favor of art," 
she said. 



522  

Sherringham looked at her a moment. " Dear 
Biddy, your little digs are as soft as zephyrs." 

She colored, but she protested. " My little 
digs ? What do you mean ? Are you not in 
favor of art ?" 

" The question is delightfully simple. I don t 
know what you re talking about. Everything 
has its place. A parliamentary life scarcely 
seems to me the situation for portrait-painting." 
" That s just what Nick says." 
" You talk of it together a great deal ? " 
" Yes, Nick s very good to me." 
" Clever Nick ! And what do you advise 
him?" 

" Oh, to do something." 

"That s valuable," Peter laughed. "Not to 
give up his sweetheart for the sake of a paint-pot, 
I hope ? " 

" Never, never, Peter ! It s not a question of 
his giving up, for Julia has herself drawn back. 
I think she never really felt safe ; she loved him, 
but she was afraid of him. Now she s only 
afraid she has lost the confidence she tried to 
have. Nick has tried to hold her, but she has 
jerked herself away. Do you know what she 
said to me ? She said, My confidence has gone 
forever. " 

" I did n t know she was such a prig ! " Sher 
ringham exclaimed. "They re queer people, 
verily, with water in their veins instead of blood. 
You and I would n t be like that, should we ? 



, $2$ 

though you have taken up such a discouraging 
position, about caring for a fellow." 

" I care for art," poor Biddy returned. 

" You do, to some purpose," said Peter, glan 
cing at the bust. 

" To that of making you laugh at me." 

" Would you give a good man up for that ? " 

" A good man ? What man ? " 

"Well, say me if I wanted to marry you." 

Biddy hesitated a little. " Of course I would, 
in a moment. At any rate, I d give up the 
House of Commons. That s what Nick s going 
to do now only you must n t tell any one." 

Sherringham stared. "H0 s going to chuck 
up his seat ?" 

"I think his mind is made up to it. He has 
talked me over we have had some deep discus 
sions. Yes, I m on the side of art !" said Biddy, 
ardently. 

"Do you mean in order to paint to paint 
Miss Rooth ? " Peter went on. 

" To paint every one that s what he wants. 
By keeping his seat he has n t kept Julia, and she 
was the thing he cared most for, in public life. 
When he has got out of the whole thing his atti 
tude, as he says, will be at least clear. He s tre 
mendously interesting about it, Peter ; he has 
talked to me wonderfully ; he has won me over. 
Mamma s heart-broken; telling her will be the 
hardest part." 

" If she does n t know, why is she heart 
broken ? " 



524 7HK TRAGIC MUSE. 

"Oh, at the marriage not coming off she 
knows that. That s what she wanted. She 
thought it perfection. She blames Nick fear 
fully. She thinks he held the whole thing in his 
hand and that he has thrown away a magnificent 
opportunity." 

" And what does Nick say to her ? " 

" He says, Dear old mummy ! 

"That s good," said Sherringham. 

" I don t know what will become of her when 
this other blow arrives," Biddy pursued. " Poor 
Nick wants to please her he does, he does. 
But, as he says, you can t please every one, and 
you must, before you die, please yourself a little." 

Peter Sherringham sat looking at the floor ; 
the color had risen to his face while he listened 
to the girl. Then he sprang up and took another 
turn about the room. His companion s artless 
but vivid recital had set his blood in motion. He 
had taken Nick s Dormer s political prospects 
very much for granted, thought of them as defi 
nite and brilliant and seductive. To learn there 
was something for which he was ready to re 
nounce such honors, and to recognize the nature 
of that bribe, affected Sherringham powerfully 
and strangely. He felt as if he had heard the 
sudden blare of a trumpet, and he felt at the 
same time as if he had received a sudden slap in 
the face. Nick s bribe was " art " the strange 
temptress with whom he himself had been wres 
tling and over whom he had finally ventured to 



 525 

believe that wisdom and training had won a vic 
tory. There was something in the conduct of his 
old friend and playfellow that made all his rea 
sonings small. Nick s unexpected choice acted 
on him as a -reproach and a challenge. He felt 
ashamed at having placed himself so unromanti- 
cally on his guard, and rapidly said to himself 
that if Nick could afford to allow so much for 
"art" he might surely exhibit some of the same 
confidence. There had never been the least 
avowed competition between the cousins their 
lines lay too far apart for that ; but nevertheless 
they rode in sight of each other, and Sherring- 
ham had at present the sensation of suddenly 
seeing Nick Dormer give his horse the spur, 
bound forward and fly over a wall. He was put 
on his mettle and he had not to look long to spy 
an obstacle that he too might ride at. High rose 
his curiosity to see what warrant his kinsman 
might have for such risks how he was mounted 
for such exploits. He really knew little about 
Nick s talent so little as to feel no right to ex 
claim " What an ass ! " when Biddy gave him the 
news which only the existence of real talent 
could redeem from absurdity. All his eagerness 
to ascertain what Nick had been able to make of 
such a subject as Miriam Rooth came back to 
him ; though it was what mainly had brought him 
to Rosedale Road he had forgotten it in the 
happy accident of his encounter with Biddy. He 
was conscious that if the surprise of a revelation 



526  

of power were in store for him Nick would be 
justified more than he himself would feel rein 
stated in his self-respect. For the courage of re 
nouncing the forum for the studio hovered before 
him as greater than the courage of marrying an 
actress whom one was in love with : the reward, 
in the latter case, was so much more immediate. 
Peter asked Biddy what Nick had done with his 
portrait of Miriam. He hadn t seen it anywhere 
in rummaging about the room. 

" I think it s here somewhere, but I don t 
know," Biddy replied, getting up and looking 
vaguely round her. 

"Haven t you seen it ? Hasn t he shown it 
to you ? " 

The girl rested her eyes on him strangely a 
moment ; then she turned them away from him 
with a mechanical air of seeking for the picture. 
" I think it s in the room, put away with its face 
to the wall." 

" One of those dozen canvases with their backs 
to us ? " 

" One of those perhaps." 

" Have n t you tried to see ? " 

"I haven t touched them," said Biddy, color 
ing. 

" Hasn t Nick had it out to show you ? " 

" He says it s in too bad a state it is n t fin 
ished it won t do." 

" And have n t you had the curiosity to turn it 
round for yourself ? " 



 $2? 

The embarrassed look in poor Biddy s face 
deepened, and it seamed to Sherringham that her 
eyes pleaded with him a moment, that there was 
a menace of tears in them, a gleam of anguish. 
" I have had an idea he would n t like it." 

Her visitor s own desire, however, had become 
too lively for easy forbearance. He laid his hand 
on two or three canvases which proved, as he ex 
tricated them, to be either blank or covered with 
rudimentary forms. " Dear Biddy, are you as 
docile, as obliging, as that ? " he asked, pulling 
out something else. 

The inquiry was meant in familiar kindness, 
for Peter was struck, even to admiration, with 
the girl s having a sense of honor which all girls 
have not. She must in this particular case have 
longed for a sight of Nick s work the work 
which had brought about such a crisis in his life. 
But she had passed hours in his studio alone, 
without permitting herself a stolen peep ; she 
was capable of that if she believed it would 
please him. Sherringham liked a charming girl s 
being capable of that (he had known charming 
gins who would not have been), and his question 
was really an expression of respect. Biddy, how 
ever, apparently discovered some light mockery 
in it, and she broke out, incongruously : 

" I have n t wanted so much to see it. 1 don t 
care for her so much as that." 

" So much as that ? " 

" I don t care for his actress for that vulgar 



528  

creature. I don t like her ! " said Biddy, unex 
pectedly. 

Peter stared. " I thought you had n t seen 
her." 

"I saw her in Paris twice. She was won 
derfully clever, but she did n t charm me." 

Sherringham quickly considered, and then he 
said benevolently: "I won t inflict the picture 
upon you, then; we ll leave it alone for the pre 
sent." Biddy made no reply to this at first, but 
after a moment she went straight over to the row 
of stacked canvases and exposed several of them 
to the light. " Why did you say you wished to 
go to the theatre to-night ? " her companion con 
tinued. 

Still the girl was silent ; then she exclaimed, 
with her back turned to him and a little tremor 
in her voice, while she drew forth one of her bro 
ther s studies after the other : " For the sake of 
your company, Peter ! Here it is, I think," she 
added, moving a large canvas with some effort. 
" No, no, I 11 hold it for you. Is that the 
light ? " 

She would n t let him take it ; she bade him 
stand off and allow her to place it in the right 
position. In this position she carefully presented 
it, supporting it, at the proper angle, from behind 
and showing her head and shoulders above it. 
From the moment his eyes rested on the picture 
Sherringham accepted this service without pro 
test. Unfinished, simplified and in some portions 



 529 

merely suggested, it was strong, brilliant and 
vivid, and had already the look of life and the 
air of an original thing. Sherringham was star 
tled, he was strangely affected he had no idea 
Nick moved with that stride. Miriam was rep 
resented in three quarters, seated, almost down 
to her feet. She leaned forward, with one of her 
legs crossed over the other, her arms extended 
and foreshortened, her hands locked together 
round her knee. Her beautiful head was bent a 
little, broodingly, and her splendid face seemed 
to look down at life. She had a grand appear 
ance of being raised aloft, with a wide regard, 
from a height of intelligence, for the great field 
of the artist, all the figures and passions he may 
represent. Peter wondered where his kinsman 
had learned to paint like that. He almost gasped 
at the composition of the thing, at the drawing 
of the moulded arms. Biddy Dormer abstained 
from looking round the corner of the canvas as 
she held it ; she only watched, in Peter s eyes, 
for his impression of it. This she easily caught, 
and he could see that she had done so when, 
after a few minutes, he went to relieve her. She 
let him lift the thing out of her grasp ; he moved 
it and rested it, so that they could still see it, 
against the high back of a chair. " It s tremen 
dously good," he said. 

" Dear, dear Nick," Biddy murmured, looking 
at it now. 

" Poor, poor Julia ! " Sherringham was prompted 



530  

to exclaim in a different tone. His companion 
made no rejoinder to this, and they stood another 
minute or two side by side, in silence, gazing at 
the portrait. Then Sherringham took up his hat 
he had no more time, he must go. " Will you 
come to-night, all the same ? " he asked, with a 
laugh that was somewhat awkward, putting out 
his hand to Biddy. 

" All the same ? " 

" Why, you say she s a terrible creature," 
Peter went on, with his eyes on the painted face. 

" Oh, anything for art ! " said Biddy, smiling. 

" Well, at seven o clock then." And Sherring 
ham went away immediately, leaving the girl 
alone with the Tragic Muse and feeling again, 
with a quickened rush, a sense of the beauty of 
Miriam, as well as a new comprehension of the 
talent of Nick. 



XXX. 

IT was not till noon, or rather later, the next 
day, that Sherringham saw Miriam Rooth. He 
wrote her a note that evening, to be delivered to 
her at the theatre, and during the performance 
she sent round to him a card with " All right 
come to luncheon to-morrow," scrawled upon it 
in pencil. 

When he presented himself in Balaklava Place 
he learned that the two ladies had not come in 
they had gone again, early, to rehearsal ; but they 
had left word that he was to be pleased to wait 
they would come in from one moment to the 
other. It was further mentioned to him, as he 
was ushered into the drawing-room, that Mr. 
Dashwood was on the ground. This circum 
stance, however, Sherringham barely noted : he 
had been soaring so high for the past twelve 
hours that he had almost lost consciousness of 
the minor differences of earthly things. He had 
taken Biddy Dormer and her friend Miss Tressil- 
ian home from the play, and after leaving them 
he had walked about the streets, he had roamed 
back to his sister s house, in a state of exultation 
deepened by the fact that all the evening he had 
contained himself, thinking it more decorous and 



532  

considerate, less invidious, not to " rave." Sit 
ting there in the shade of the box with his com 
panions, he had watched Miriam in attentive but 
inexpressive silence, glowing and vibrating in 
wardly, but, for these fine, deep reasons, not com 
mitting himself to the spoken rapture. Delicacy, 
it appeared to him, should rule the hour ; and 
indeed he had never had a pleasure more delicate 
than this little period of still observation and re 
pressed ecstasy. Miriam s art lost nothing by 
it, and Biddy s mild nearness only gained. This 
young lady was silent also wonderingly, daunt- 
edly, as if she too were conscious in relation to 
the actress of various other things beside her 
mastery of her art. To this mastery Biddy s at 
titude was a candid and liberal tribute : the poor 
girl sat quenched and pale, as if in the blinding 
light of a comparison by which it would be pre 
sumptuous even to be annihilated. Her subjec 
tion, however, was a gratified, a charmed subjec 
tion : there was a beneficence in such beauty 
the beauty of the figure that moved before the 
footlights and spoke in music even if it de 
prived one of hope. Peter did n t say to her, in 
vulgar elation and in reference to her whimsical 
profession of dislike at the studio, " Well, do you 
find this performer so disagreeable now ? " and 
she was grateful to him for his forbearance, for 
the tacit kindness of which the idea seemed to 
be : " My poor child, I would prefer you if I 
could; but judge for yourself how can I? 



 533 

Expect of me only the possible. Expect that, 
certainly, but only that." In the same degree 
Peter liked Biddy s sweet, hushed air of judging 
for herself, of recognizing his discretion and let 
ting him off, while she was lost in the illusion, in 
the convincing picture, of the stage. Miss Tres- 
silian did most of the criticism : she broke out 
cheerfully and sonorously from time to time, in 
reference to the actress : " Most striking, cer 
tainly," or, " She is clever, is n t she ? " It was 
a manner to which her companions found it im 
possible to respond. Miss Tressilian was disap 
pointed in nothing but their enjoyment : they 
did n t seem to think the exhibition as amusing 
as she. 

Walking away through the ordered void of 
Lady Agnes s quarter, with the four acts of the 
play glowing again before him in the smokeless 
London night, Sherringham found the liveliest 
thing in his impression the certitude that if he 
had never seen Miriam before, and she had had 
for him none of the advantages of association, he 
would still have recognized in her performance 
the most interesting thing that the theatre had 
ever offered him. He floated in a sense of the 
felicity of it, in the general encouragement of a 
thing perfectly done, in the almost aggressive 
bravery of still larger claims for an art which 
could so triumphantly, so exquisitely render life. 
" Render it ? " Peter said to himself. " Create it 
and reveal it, rather ; give us something new and 



534  

large and of the first order ! " He had seen Mir 
iam now ; he had never seen her before ; he had 
never seen her till he saw her in her conditions. 
Oh, her conditions there were many things to 
be said about them ; they were paltry enough as 
yet, inferior, inadequate, obstructive, as compared 
with the right, full, finished setting of such a 
talent ; but the essence of them was now, irre- 
movably, in Sherringham s eye, the vision of how 
the uplifted stage and the listening house trans 
formed her. That idea of her having no char 
acter of her own came back to him with a force 
that made him laugh in the empty street : this 
was a disadvantage she was so exempt from that 
he appeared to himself not to have known her 
till to-night. Her character was simply to hold 
you by tli2 particular spell ; any other the 
good-nature of home, the relation to her mother, 
her friends, her lovers, her debts, the practice of 
virtues or industries or vices was not worth 
speaking of. These things were the fictions and 
shadows ; the representation was the deep sub 
stance. 

Sherringham had, as he went, an intense vision 
(he had often had it before) of the conditions 
which were still absent, the great and complete 
ones, those which would give the girl s talent 
a superior, glorious stage. More than ever he 
desired them, mentally invoked them, filled them 
out, in imagination, cheated himself with the 
idea that they were possible. He saw them in a 



 535 

momentary illusion and confusion : a great aca 
demic, artistic theatre, subsidized and unburdened 
with money-getting, rich in its repertory, rich in 
the high quality and the wide array of its ser 
vants, and above all in the authority of an impos 
sible administrator a manager personally disin 
terested, not an actor with an eye to the main 
chance ; pouring forth a continuity of tradition, 
striving for perfection, laying a splendid litera 
ture under contribution. He saw the heroine of 
a hundred "situations," variously dramatic and 
vividly real ; he saw comedy and drama and pas 
sion and character and English life ; he saw all 
humanity and history and poetry, and perpetually, 
in the midst of them, shining out in the high 
relief of some great moment, an image as fresh 
as an unveiled statue. He was not unconscious 
that he was taking all sorts of impossibilities and 
miracles for granted ; but it really seemed to him 
for the time that the woman he had been watch 
ing three hours, the incarnation of the serious 
drama, would be a new and vivifying force. The 
world was just then so bright to him that Basil 
Dashwood struck him at first as an harmonious 
minister of that force. 

It must be added that before Miriam arrived 
the breeze that filled Sherringham s sail began to 
sink a little. He passed out of the eminently 
"let " drawing-room, where twenty large photo 
graphs of the young actress bloomed in the 
desert ; he went into the garden by a glass door 



536 THE TRAGIC MUSH. 

that stood open, and found Mr. Dashwood reclin 
ing on a bench and smoking cigarettes. This 
young man s conversation was a different music 
- it took him down, as he felt ; showed him, 
very sensibly and intelligibly, it must be con 
fessed, the actual theatre, the one they were all 
concerned with, the one they would have to make 
the miserable best of. It was fortunate for Sher- 
ringham that he kept his intoxication mainly to 
himself : the Englishman s habit of not being 
effusive still prevailed with him, even after his 
years of exposure to the foreign infection. No 
thing could have been less exclamatory than the 
meeting of the two men, with its question or two, 
its remark or two, about Sherringham s arrival 
in London ; its offhand " I noticed you last night. 
I was glad you turned up at last," on one side, 
and its attenuated " Oh, yes, it was the first time. 
I was very much interested," on the other. Basil 
Dashwood played a part in " Yolande," and Sher- 
ringham had had the satisfaction of taking the 
measure of his aptitude. He judged it to be of 
the small order, as indeed the part, which was 
neither that of the virtuous nor that of the vil 
lainous hero, restricted him to two or three in 
conspicuous effects and three or four changes of 
dress. He represented an ardent but respectful 
young lover whom the distracted heroine found 
time to pity a little and even to rail at ; but it 
was impressed upon Sherringham that he scarcely 
represented young love. He looked very well, 



 * 537 

but Peter had beard him already in a hundred 
contemporary pieces ; he never got out of re 
hearsal. He uttered sentiments and breathed 
vows with a nice voice, with a shy, boyish tremor 
in it, but as if he were afraid of being chaffed for 
it afterwards ; giving the spectator, in the stalls, 
the feeling of holding the prompt-book and lis 
tening to a recitation. He made one think of 
country-houses and lawn-tennis and private the 
atricals ; than which there could not be, to Sher- 
ringham s sense, an association more disconnected 
with the actor s art. 

Dashwood knew all about the new thing, the 
piece in rehearsal ; he knew all about everything 
receipts and salaries and expenses and news 
paper articles, and what old Baskerville said and 
what Mrs. Ruffler thought : matters of superfi 
cial concern to Sherringham, who wondered, be 
fore Miriam appeared, whether she talked with 
her " walking-gentleman " about them by the 
hour, deep in them and finding them not vulgar 
and boring, but the natural air of her life and the 
essence of her profession. Of course she did 
she naturally would ; it was all in the day s work 
and he might feel sure she would n t turn up her 
nose at the shop. He had to remind himself 
that he did n t care if she did n t that he would 
think worse of her if she should. She certainly 
had much confabulation with her competent play 
fellow, talking shop by the hour : Sherringham 
could see that from the familiar, customary way 



538 fc  

Dashwood sat there with his cigarette, as if he 
were in possession and on his own ground. He 
divined a great intimacy between the two young 
artists, but asked himself at the same time what 
he, Peter Sherringham, had to say about it. He 
did n t pretend to control Miriam s intimacies, it 
was to be supposed ; and if he had encouraged 
her to a:lopt a profession which abounded in op 
portunities for comradeship it was not for him to 
cry out because she had taken to it kindly. He 
had already descried a fund of utility in Mrs. 
Lovick s light brother ; but it irritated him, all 
the same, after a while, to hear Basil Dashwood 
represent himself as almost indispensable. He 
was practical there was no doubt of that ; and 
this idea added to Sherringham s paradoxical 
sense that as regards the matters actually in 
question he himself had not this virtue. Dash- 
wood had got Mrs. Rooth the house ; it happened 
by a lucky chance that Laura Lumley, to whom 
it belonged (Sherringham would know Laura 
Lumley ?) wanted to get rid, for a mere song, of 
the remainder of a lease. She was going to Aus 
tralia with a troupe of her own. They just stepped 
into it ; it was good air the best sort of air to 
live in, to sleep in, in London, for people in their 
line. Sherringham wondered what Miriam s per 
sonal relations with this deucedly knowing gen 
tleman might be, and was again able to assure 
himself that they might be anything in the world 
she liked, for any stake he, Peter, had in them. 



 539 

Dashwood told him of all the smart people who 
had trieil to take up the new star the way the 
London world had already held out its hand ; and 
perhaps it was Sherringham s irritation, the 
crushed sentiment I just mentioned, that gave a 
little heave in the exclamation, " Oh, that 
that s all rubbish : the less of that the better ! " 
At this Basil Dashwood stared ; he evidently felt 
snubbed ; he had expected his interlocutor to be 
pleased with the names of the eager ladies who 
had "called" -which proved to Sherringham 
that he took a low view of his art. The secretary 
of embassy explained (it is to be hoped not pe 
dantically) that this art was serious work and 
that society was humbug and imbecility ; also 
that of old the great comedians would n t have 
known such people. Garrick had essentially his 
own circle. 

" No, I suppose they did n t call in the old nar 
row-minded time," said Basil Dashwood. 

"Your profession didn t call. They had bet 
ter company that of the romantic, gallant char 
acters they represented. They lived with them, 
and it was better all round." And Peter asked 
himself for the young man looked as if that 
struck him as a dreary period if he only, for 
Miriam, in her new life, or among the futilities 
of those who tried to find her accessible, ex 
pressed the artistic idea. This at least, Sher 
ringham reflected, was a situation that could be 
improved. 



540  

He learned from Dashwood that the new play, 
the thing they were rehearsing, was an old play, 
a romantic drama of thirty years before, very 
frequently revived and threadbare with honorable 
service. Dashwood had a part in it, but there 
was an act in which he did n t appear, and that 
was the act they were doing that morning. " Yo 
lande " had done all " Yolande " could do : Sher- 
ringham was mistaken if he supposed " Yolande " 
was such a tremendous hit. It had done very 
well, it had run three months, but they were by 
no means coining money with it. It would n t 
take them to the end of. the season; they had 
seen, for a month past, that they would have to 
put on something else. Miss Rooth moreover 
wanted a new part ; she was impatient to show 
what a range she was capable of. She had grand 
ideas ; she thought herself very good-natured to 
repeat the same thing for three months. Basil 
Dashwood lighted another cigarette and de 
scribed to his companion some of Miss Rooth s 
ideas. He gave Sherringham a great deal of in 
formation about her about her character, her 
temper, her peculiarities, her little ways, her 
manner of producing some of her effects. He 
spoke with familiarity and confidence, as if he 
knew more about her than any one else as if 
he had invented or discovered her, were in a 
sense her proprietor or guarantor. It was the 
talk of the shop, with a perceptible shrewdness 
in it and a touching young candor ; the expan- 



 54 r 

siveness of the commercial spirit when it relaxes 
and generalizes, is conscious it is safe with an 
other member of the guild. 

Sherringham could not help protesting against 
the lame old war-horse whom it was proposed to 
bring into action, who had been ridden to death 
and had saved a thousand desperate fields ; and 
he exclaimed on the strange passion of the good 
British public for sitting again and again through 
expected situations, watching for speeches they 
had heard and surprises that struck the hour. 
Dashwood defended the taste of London, praised 
it as loyal, constant, faithful ; to which Sherring 
ham retorted with some vivacity that it was 
faithful to rubbish. He justified this sally by 
declaring that the play in rehearsal was rubbish, 
clumsy mediocrity which had outlived its con 
venience, and that the fault was the want of life 
in the critical sense of the public, which was ig 
nobly docile, opening its mouth for its dose, like 
the pupi] s of Dotheboys Hall ; not insisting on 
something different, on a fresh preparation. 
Dashwood asked him if he then wished Miss 
Rooth to go on playing forever a part she had 
repeated more than eighty nights on end : he 
thought the modern " run " was just what he had 
heard him denounce, in Paris, as the disease the 
theatre was dying of. This imputation Sherring 
ham gainsaid ; he wanted to know if she could n t 
change to something less stale than the piece 
in question. Dashwood opined that Miss Rooth 



542  

must have a strong part and that there happened 
to be one for her in the before-mentioned vener 
able novelty. She had to take what she could 
get ; she was n t a girl to cry for the moon. This 
was a stop-gap -- she would try other things 
later ; she would have to look round her ; you 
could n t have a new piece left at your door every 
day with the milk. On one point Sherringham s 
mind might be at rest : Miss Rooth was a woman 
who would do every blessed thing there was to 
do. Give her time and she would walk straight 
through the repertory. She was a woman who 
would do this she was a woman who would do 
that : Basil Dashwood employed this phrase so 
often that Sherringham, nervous, got up and 
threw an unsmoked cigarette away. Of course 
she was a woman ; there was no need of Dash- 
wood s saying it a hundred times. 

As for the repertory, the young man went 
on, the most beautiful girl in the world could 
give but what she had. He explained, after 
Sherringham sat down again, that the noise made 
by Miss Rooth was not exactly what this admirer 
appeared to suppose. Sherringham had seen the 
house the night before ; would recognize that, 
though good, it was very far from great. She 
had clone very well, very well indeed, but she had 
never gone above a point which Dashwood ex 
pressed in pounds sterling, to the edification of 
his companion, who vaguely thought the figure 
Vigh. Sherringham remembered that he had 



 543 

been unable to get a stall, but Dashwood insisted 
that the girl had not leaped into commanding 
fame : that was a thing that never happened in 
fact it happened only in pretentious works of 
fiction. She had attracted notice, unusual notice 
for a woman whose name, the day before, had 
never been heard of : she was recognized as hav 
ing, for a novice, extraordinary cleverness and 
confidence in addition to her looks, of course, 
which were the thing that had really fetched the 
crowd. But she had n t been the talk of London ; 
she had only been the talk of Gabriel Nash. He 
was n t London, more was the pity. He knew 
the aesthetic people the worldly, semi-smart 
ones, not the frumpy, sickly lot who wore dirty 
drapery ; and the aesthetic people had run after 
her. Basil Dashwood instructed Sherringham, 
sketchily, as to the different sects in the great 
religion of beauty, and was able to give him 
the particular "note" of the critical clique to 
which Miriam had begun so quickly to owe it 
that she had a vogue. The information made the 
secretary of embassy feel very ignorant of the 
world, very uninitiated and buried in his little 
professional hole. Dashwood warned him that 
it would be a long time before the general public 
would wake up to Miss Rooth, even after she 
had waked up to herself; she would have to do 
some really big thing first. They knew it was 
in her, the big thing Sherringham and he, and 
even poor Nash because they had seen her as 



544  

no one else had ; but London never took any one 
on trust it had to be cash down. It would 
take their young lady two or three years to pay 
out her cash and get her equivalent. But of 
course the equivalent would be simply a gold 
mine. Within its limits, however, her success 
was already quite a fairy-tale : there was magic 
in the way she had concealed, from the first, her 
want of experience. She absolutely made you 
think she had a lot of it, more than any one else. 
Mr. Dashwood repeated several times that she 
was a cool hand a deucedly cool hand; and 
that he watched her himself, saw ideas come to 
her, saw her try different dodges on different 
nights. She was always alive she liked it her 
self. She gave him ideas, long as he had been 
on the stage. Naturally she had a great deal to 
learn a tremendous lot to learn ; a cosmopolite 
like Sherringham would understand that a girl of 
that age, who had never had a friend but her mo 
ther her mother was greater fun than ever now 
naturally would have. Sherringham winced 
at being called a " cosmopolite " by his young 
companion, just as he had winced a moment be 
fore at hearing himself lumped, in esoteric know 
ledge, with Dashwood and Gabriel Nash ; but the 
former of these gentlemen took no account of 
his sensibility while he enumerated a few of the 
things that the young actress had to learn. 
Dashwood was a mixture of acuteness and inno 
cent fatuity ; and Sherringham had to recognize 



 545 

that he had some of the elements of criticism in 
him when he said that the wonderful thing in the 
girl was that she learned so fast learned some 
thing every night, learned from the same old 
piece, a lot more than any one else would have 
learned from twenty. " That s what it is to be 
a genius," Sherringham remarked. " Genius is 
only the art of getting your experience fast, 
of stealing it, as it were ; and in this sense 
Miss Rooth s a regular brigand." Dashwood as 
sented good-humoredly ; then he added, " Oh, 
she 11 do ! " It was exactly in these simple 
words, in speaking to her, that Sherringham had 
phrased the same truth ; yet he did n t enjoy hear 
ing them on his neighbor s lips : they had a pro 
fane, patronizing sound, suggestive of displeasing 
equalities. 

The two men sat in silence for some minutes, 
watching a fat robin hop about on the little seedy 
lawn ; at the end of which they heard a vehicle 
stop on the other side of the garden wall and the 
voices of people descending from it. " Here 
they come, the dear creatures," said Basil Dash- 
wood, without moving ; and from where they sat 
Sherringham saw the small door in the wall 
pushed open. The dear creatures were three in 
number, for a gentleman had added himself to 
Mrs. Rooth and her daughter. As soon as Mi/- 
iam s eyes fell upon her Parisian friend she 
stopped short in a large, droll theatrical attitude, 
and, seizing her mother s arm, exclaimed, passion- 



546  

ately : " Look where he sits, the author of all 
my woes cold, cynical, cruel ! " She was evi 
dently in the highest spirits ; of which Mrs. 
Rooth partook as she cried, indulgently, giving 
her a slap, " Oh, get along, you gypsy ! " 

" She s always up to something," Basil Dash- 
wood commented, as Miriam, radiant and with a 
conscious stage tread, glided toward Sherringham 
as if she were coming to the footlights. He rose 
slowly from his seat, looking at her and struck 
with her beauty : he had been impatient to see 
her, yet in the act his impatience had had a dis 
concerting check. 

Sherringham had had time to perceive that 
the man who had come in with her was Gabriel 
Nash, and this recognition brought a low sigh to 
his lips as he held out his hand to her a sigh 
expressive of the sudden sense that his interest 
in her now could only be a gross community. 
Of course that did n t matter, since he had set 
it, at the most, such rigid limits ; but none the 
less he stood vividly reminded that it would be 
public and notorious, that inferior people would 
be inveterately mixed up with it, that she had 
crossed the line and sold herself to the vulgar, 
making him, indeed, only one of an equalized 
multitude. The way Gabriel Nash turned up 
there just when he did n t want to see him made 
Peter feel that it was a complicated thing to have 
a friendship with an actress so clearly destined 
to be famous. He quite forgot that Nash had 



 547 

known Miriam long before his own introduction 
to her and had been present at their first meet 
ing, which he had in fact in a measure brought 
about. Had Sherringham not been so cut out 
to make trouble of this particular joy he might 
have found some adequate assurance that she 
distinguished him in the way in which, taking his 
hand in both of hers, she looked up at him and 
murmured, " Dear old master!" Then, as if 
this were not acknowledgment enough, she raised 
her head still higher, and whimsically, gratefully, 
charmingly, almost nobly, she kissed him on the 
lips, before the other men, before the good mo 
ther whose " Oh, you honest creature ! " made 
everything regular. 



XXXI. 

IF Peter Sherringham was ruffled by some of 
Miriam s circumstances there was comfort and 
consolation to be drawn from others, beside the 
essential fascination (there was no doubt about 
that now) of the young lady s own society. He 
spent the afternoon, they all spent the afternoon, 
and the occasion reminded him of a scene in 
"Wilhelm Meister." Mrs. Rooth had little re 
semblance to Mignon, but Miriam was remark 
ably like Philina. Luncheon was delayed two or 
three hours ; but the long wait was a positive 
source of gayety, for they all smoked cigarettes 
in the garden and Miriam gave striking illustra 
tions of the parts she was studying. Sherring 
ham was in the state of a man whose toothache 
has suddenly stopped he was exhilarated by the 
cessation of pain. The pain had been the effort 
to remain in Paris after Miriam came to London, 
and the balm of seeing her now was the measure 
of the previous soreness. 

Gabriel Nash had, as usual, plenty to say, and 
he talked of Nick Dormer s picture so long that 
Sherringham wondered whether he did it on pur 
pose to vex him. They went in and out of the 
house ; they made excursions to see how lunch 



 549 

was coming on ; and Sherringham got half an 
hour alone, or virtually alone, with the object of 
his unsanctioned passion drawing her publicly 
away from the others and making her sit with 
him in the most sequestered part of the little 
graveled grounds. There was summer enough 
in the trees to shut out the adjacent villas, 
and Basil Dashwood and Gabriel Nash lounged 
together at a convenient distance, while Nick s 
whimsical friend tried experiments upon the his 
trionic mind. Miriam confessed that, like all 
comedians, they ate at queer hours ; she sent 
Dashwood in for biscuits and sherry she pro 
posed sending him round to the grocer s in the 
Circus Road for superior wine. Sherringham 
judged him to be the factotum of the little house 
hold : he knew where the biscuits were kept and 
the state of the grocer s account. When Peter 
congratulated the young actress on having so 
useful an associate she said genially, but as if the 
words disposed of him, " Oh, he s awfully handy." 
To this she added, " You re not, you know ; " 
resting the kindest, most pitying eyes on him. 
The sensation they gave him was as sweet as if 
she had stroked his cheek, and her manner was 
responsive even to tenderness. She called him 
" Dear master " again, and sometimes " Cher 
inaitre," and appeared to express gratitude and 
reverence by every intonation. 

" You re doing the humble dependent now," he 
said : " you do it beautifully, as you do every- 



550  

thing." She replied that she didn t make it 
humble enough she could n t ; she was too 
proud, too insolent in her triumph. She liked 
that, the triumph, too much, and she didn t mind 
telling him that she was perfectly happy. Of 
course as yet the triumph was very limited ; but 
success was success, whatever its quantity ; the 
dish was a small one, but it had the right taste. 
Her imagination had already bounded beyond 
the first phase, unexpectedly brilliant as this had 
been : her position struck her as modest com 
pared with a future that was now vivid to her. 
Sherringham had never seen her so soft and 
sympathetic ; she had insisted, in Paris, that her 
personal character was that of the good girl (she 
used the term in a fine loose way), and it was 
impossible to be a better girl than she showed 
herself this pleasant afternoon. She was full of 
gossip and anecdote and drollery; she had exactly 
the air that he would have liked her to have 
that of thinking of no end of things to tell him. 
It was as if she had just returned from a long 
journey, had had strange adventures and made 
wonderful discoveries. She began to speak of 
this and that, and broke off to speak of something 
else ; she talked of the theatre, of the newspapers 
and then of London, of the people she had met 
and the extraordinary things they said to her, of 
the parts she was going to take up, of lots of 
new ideas that had come to her about the art of 
comedy. See wanted to do comedy now to do 



 551 

the comedy of London life. She was delighted 
to find that seeing more of the world suggested 
things to her; they came straight from the fact, 
from nature, if you could call it nature : so that 
she was convinced more than ever that the artist 
ought to live, to get on with his business, gather 
ideas, lights from experience ought to welcome 
any experience that would give him lights. But 
work, of course, was experience, and everything 
in one s life that was good was work. That was 
the jolly thing in the actor s trade it made up 
for other elements that were odious : if you only 
kept your eyes open nothing could happen to you 
that would n t be food for observation and grist to 
your mill, showing you how people looked a-nd 
moved and spoke, cried and grimaced, or writhed 
and dissimulated, in given situations. She saw 
all round her things she wanted to " do " Lon 
don was full of them, if you had eyes to see. 
Miriam demanded imperiously why people did n t 
take them up, put them into plays and parts, give 
one a chance with them ; she expressed her sharp 
impatience of the general literary stupidity. She 
had never been chary of this particular displea 
sure, and there were moments (it was an old story 
and a subject of frank raillery to Sherringham) 
when to hear her you might have thought there 
was no cleverness anywhere but in her disdainful 
mind. She wanted tremendous things done, that 
she might use them, but she didn t pretend to 
say exactly what they were to be, nor, even ap- 



552  

proximately, how they were to be handled : her 
ground was rather that if she only had a pen it 
was exasperating to have to explain ! She mainly 
contented herself with declaring that nothing had 
really been touched : she felt that more and more 
as she saw more of people s goings-on. 

Sherringham went to her theatre again that 
evening, and he made no scruple of going every 
night for a week. Rather, perhaps I should say, 
he made a scruple ; but it was a part of the plea 
sure of his life during these arbitrary days to 
overcome it. The only way to prove to himself 
that he could overcome it was to go ; and he was 
satisfied, after he had been seven times, not only 
with the spectacle on the stage but with his own 
powers of demonstration. There was no satiety, 
however, with the spectacle on the stage, inas 
much as that only produced a further curiosity. 
Miriam s performance was a living thing, with a 
power to change, to grow, to develop, to beget 
new forms of the same life. Peter Sherringham 
contributed to it, in his amateurish way, and 
watched with solicitude the fate of his contribu 
tions. He talked it over in Balaklava Place, 
suggested modifications, variations worth trying. 
Miriam professe .l herself thankful for any refresh 
ment that could be administered to her interest 
in " Yolancle," and, with an effectiveness that 
showed large resource, touched up her part and 
drew several new airs from it. Sherringham s 
suggestions bore upon her way of uttering cer 



 553 

tain speeches, the intonations that would have 
more beauty or make the words mean more. 
Miriam had her ideas, or rather she had. her in 
stincts, which she defended and illustrated, with 
a vividness superior to argument, by a happy 
pictorial phrase or a snatch of mimicry; but she 
was always for trying ; she liked experiments and 
caught at them, and she was especially thankful 
when some one gave her a showy reason, a 
plausible formula, in a case where she only stood 
upon an intuition. She pretended to despise 
reasons and to like and dislike at her sovereign 
pleasure ; but she always honored the exotic gift, 
so that Sherringham was amused with the liberal 
way she produced it, as if she had been a naked 
islander rejoicing in a present of crimson cloth. 

Day after day he spent most of his time in her 
society, and Miss Laura Lumley s recent habita 
tion became the place in London to which his 
thoughts were most attached. He was highly 
conscious that he was not now carrying out that 
principle of abstention which he had brought to 
such maturity before leaving Paris ; but he con 
tented himself with a much cruder justification 
of this inconsequence than he would have thought 
adequate in advance. It consisted simply in the 
idea that to be identified with the first public 
steps of a young genius was a delightful expe 
rience. What was the harm of it, if the.,genius 
were real ? Sherringham s main security was 
now that his relations with Miriam had been 



554  

frankly placed under the protection of the idea 
of legitimate extravagance. In this department 
they made a very creditable figure, and required 
much less watching and pruning than when it 
was his effort to fit them into a worldly plan. 
Sherringham had a sense of real wisdom when 
he said to himself that it surely should be enough 
that this momentary intellectual participation in 
the girl s dawning fame was a charming thing. 
Charming things, in a busy man s life, were not 
frequent enough to be kicked out of the way. 
Balaklava Place, looked at in this philosophic 
way, became almost idyllic : it gave Peter the 
pleasantest impression he had ever had of Lon 
don. 

The season happened to be remarkably fine ; 
the temperature was high, but not so high as to 
keep people from the theatre. Miriam s " busi 
ness " visibly increased, so that the question of 
putting on the second play underwent some re 
consideration. The girl insisted, showing in her 
insistence a temper of which Sherringham had 
already caught some splendid gleams. It was 
very evident that through her career it would be 
her expectation to carry tilings with a high hand. 
Her managers and agents would not find her an 
easy victim or a calculable force ; but the public 
would adore her, surround her with the popu 
larity that attaches to a humorous, good-natured 
princess, and her comrades would have a kind 
ness for her, because she would n t be selfish. 



 555 

They too would form, in a manner, a portion of 
her affectionate public. This was the way Sher- 
ringham read the signs, liking her whimsical tol 
erance of some of her vulgar playfellows almost 
well enough to forgive their presence in Bala- 
klava Place, where they were a sore tria] to her 
mother, who wanted her to multiply her points 
of contact only with the higher orders. There 
were hours when Sherringham thought he fore 
saw that her principal relation to the proper world 
would be to have, within two or three years, a 
grand battle with it, making it take her, if she 
let it have her at all, absolutely on her own 
terms : a picture which led our young man to 
ask himself, with a helplessness that was not 
exempt, as he perfectly knew, from absurdity, 
what part he should find himself playing in such 
a contest and if it would be reserved to him to 
be the more ridiculous as a peacemaker or as a 
heavy auxiliary. 

" She might know any one she would, and the 
only person she appears to take any pleasure in 
is that dreadful Miss Rover," Mrs. Rooth whim 
pered, more than once, to Sherringham, who 
recognized in the young lady so designated the 
principal complication of Balaklava Place. 

Miss Rover was a little actress who played at 
Miriam s theatre, combining with an unusual apti 
tude for delicate comedy a less exceptional ab 
sence of rigor in private life. She was pretty 
and quick and clever, and had a fineness that 



556 THE l^RAGIC MUSE. 

Miriam professed herself already in a position to 
estimate as rare. She had no control of her in 
clinations ; yet sometimes they were wholly laud 
able, like the devotion she had formed for her 
beautiful colleague, whom she admired not only 
as an ornament of the profession, but as a being 
of a more fortunate essence. She had had an idea 
that real ladies were " nasty ; " but Miriam was 
not nasty, and who could gainsay that Miriam was 
a real lady ? The girl justified herself to Sherring- 
ham, who had found no fault with her ; she knew 
how much her mother feared that the proper world 
would n t come in if they knew that the improper, 
in the person of pretty Miss Rover, was on the 
ground. What did she care who came and who 
did n t, and what was to be gained by receiving 
half the snobs in London ? People would have to 
take her exactly as they found her that they 
would have to learn ; and they would be much mis 
taken if they thought her capable of becoming a 
snob too, for the sake of their sweet company. 
She did n t pretend to be anything but what she 
meant to be, the best general actress of her time ; 
and what had that to do with her seeing or not 
seeing a poor ignorant girl who had lov Well, 
she need n t say what Fanny had. She had met 
her in the way of business she did n t say she 
would have run after her. She had liked her be 
cause she was n t a stick, and when Fanny Rover 
had asked her, quite wistfully, if she might n t come 
and see her, she had n t bristled with scandalized 



 557 

virtue. Miss Rover was not a bit more stupid or 
more ill-natured than any one else: it would be 
time enough to shut the door when she should 
become st. 

Sherringham commended, even to extrava 
gance, the liberality of such comradeship; said 
; that of course a woman did n t go into that pro 
fession to see how little she could swallow. She 
was right to live with the others so long as they 
were at all possible, and it was for her, and only 
for her, to judge how long that might be. This 
was rather heroic on Peter s part, for his assumed 
detachment from the girl s personal life still left 
him a margin for some forms of uneasiness. It 
would have made, in his spirit, a great difference 
for the worse that the woman he loved, and for 
whom he wished no baser lover than himself, 
should have embraced the prospect of consorting 
only with the cheaper kind. It was all very well, 
but Fanny Rover was simply a cabotine, and that 
sort of association was an odd training for a 
young woman who was to have been good enough 
(he could n t forget that he kept remembering 
it, as if it might still have a future use) to be his 
wife. Certainly he ought to have thought of 
such things before he permitted himself to be 
come so interested in a theatrical nature. His 
heroism did him service, however, for the hour: 
it helped him by the end of the week to feel tre 
mendously broken in to Miriam s little circle. 
What helped him most, indeed, was to reflect 



,558  

that she would get tired of a good many of its 
members herself, in time ; for it was not that 
they were shocking (very few of them shone with 
that intense light), but that they could be trusted 
in the long run to bore you. 

There was a lovely Sunday, in particular, that 
he spent almost wholly in Balaklava Place he 
arrived so early when, in the afternoon, all 
sorts of odd people dropped in. Miriam held a 
reception in the little garden and insisted on al 
most all the company s staying to supper. Her 
mother shed tears to Sherringham, in the des 
ecrated house, because they had accepted, Mir 
iam and she, an invitation and in Cromwell 
Road too for the evening. Miriam decreed 
that they should n t go : they would have much 
better fun with their good friends at home. She 
sent off a message it was a terrible distance 
by a cabman, and Sherringham had the privilege 
of paying the messenger. Basil Dashwood, in 
another vehicle, proceeded to an hotel that he 
knew, a mile away, for supplementary provisions, 
and came back with a cold ham and a dozen of 
champagne. It was all very Bohemian and jour 
nalistic and picturesque, very supposedly droll 
and enviable to outsiders ; and Miriam told an 
ecdotes and gave imitations of the people she 
would have met if she had gone out : so no one 
had a sense of loss the two occasions were 
fantastically united. Mrs. Rooth drank cham 
pagne, for consolation ; though the consolation 



 

was imperfect when she remembered that she 
might have drunk it (not quite so much, indeed) 
in Cromwell Road. 

Taken in connection with the evening before, 
the clay formed, for Sherringham, the most com- 
p ete exhibition he had had of Miriam Rooth. 
He had been at the theatre, to which the Satur 
day night happened to have brought the fullest 
house she had yet played to, and he came early 
to Balaklava Place, to tell her once again (he had 
told her half a dozen times the evening before) 
that, with the excitement of her biggest audience, 
she had surpassed herself, acted with remarkable 
intensity. It pleased her to hear it, and the spirit 
with which she interpreted the signs of the fu 
ture, and, during an hour he spent alone with her, 
Mrs. Rooth being up-stairs and Basil Dashwood 
not arrived, treated him to specimens of fictive 
emotion of various kinds, was beyond any natural 
abundance that he had yet seen in a woman. The 
impression could scarcely have been other if she 
had been playing wild snatches to him at the 
piano : the bright, up-darting flame of her talk 
rose and fell like an improvisation on the keys. 
Later, all the rest of the day, he was fascinated 
by the good grace with which she fraternized 
with her visitors, finding the right words for 
each, the solvent of incongruities, the right ideas 
to keep vanity quiet and make humility gay. It 
was a wonderful expenditure of generous, ner 
vous life. But what Sherringham read in it above 



560  

all was the sense of success in youth, with the 
future large, and the action of that force upon 
all the faculties. Miriam s limited past had yet 
pinched her enough to make emancipation sweet, 
and the emancipation had come at last in an 
hour. She had stepped into her magic shoes, 
divined and appropriated everything they could 
give her, become, in a day, a really original con 
temporary. Sherringham was of course not less 
conscious of that than Nick Dormer had been 
when, in the cold light of his studio, he saw how 
she had altered. 

But the great thing, to his mind and, these first 
days, the irresistible seduction of the theatre, was 
that she was a rare incarnation of beauty. Beauty 
was the principle of everything she did and of 
the way, unerringly, she did it an exquisite 
harmony of line and motion and attitude and 
tone, what was most general and most charac 
teristic in her performance. Accidents and in 
stincts played together to this end and consti 
tuted something which was independent of her 
talent or of her merit, in a given case, and which 
in its influence, to Sherringham s imagination, 
was far superior to any merit and to any talent. 
It was a supreme infallible felicity, a source 
of importance, a stamp of absolute value. To 
see it in operation, to sit within its radius and 
feel it shift and revolve and change and never 
fail, was a corrective to the depression, the hu 
miliation, the bewilderment of life. It trans- 



 561 

ported Sherringham from the vulgar hour and 
the ugly fact ; drew him to something which had 
no reason but its sweetness, no name nor place 
save as the pure, the distant, the antique. It was 
what most made him say to himself, " Oh, hang 
it, what does it matter ?" when he reflected that 
an Jiomme serieux (as they said in Paris) rather 
gave himself away (as they said in America) by 
going every night to the same theatre, for all the 
world to stare. It was what kept him from doing 
anything but hover round Miriam kept him 
from paying any other visits, from attending to 
any business, from going back to Calcutta Gar 
dens. It was a spell which he shrank intensely 
from breaking, and the cause of a hundred post 
ponements, confusions and incoherences. It made 
of the crooked little stucco villa in St. John s 
Wood a place in the upper air, commanding the 
prospect ; a nest of winged liberties and ironies, 
hanging far aloft above the huddled town. One 
should live at altitudes when one could they 
braced and simplified ; and for a happy interval 
Sherringham never touched the earth. 

It was not that there were no influences tend 
ing at moments to drag him down an abase 
ment from which he escaped only because he 
was up so high. We have seen that Basil Dash- 
wood could affect him at times like a piece of 
wood tied to his ankle, through the circumstance 
that he made Miriam s famous conditions those 
of the public exhibition of her genius seem small 



562  

and prosaic ; so that Sherringham had to remind 
himself that perhaps this smallness was involved 
in their being at all. She carried his imagination 
off into infinite spaces, whereas she carried Dash- 
wood s only into the box-office and the revival of 
plays that were barbarously bad. The worst was 
that it was open to him to believe that a sharp 
young man who was in the business might know 
better than he. Another possessor of superior 
knowledge (he talked, that is, as if he knew bet 
ter than any one) was Gabriel Nash, who appeared 
to have abundant leisure to haunt Balaklava 
Place, or in other words appeared to enjoy the 
same command of his time as Peter Sherringham. 
Our young diplomatist regarded him with min 
gled feelings, for he had not forgotten the con 
tentious character of their first meeting or the 
degree to which he had been moved to urge upon 
Nick Dormer s consideration that his talkative 
friend was probably an ass. This personage 
turned up now as an admirer of the charming 
creature he had scoffed at, and there was some 
thing exasperating in the quietude of his incon 
sistency, of which he had not the least embarrass 
ing consciousness. Indeed he had such fantastic 
and desultory ways of looking at any question 
that it was difficult, in vulgar parlance, to have 
him ; his sympathies hummed about like bees in 
a garden, with no visible plan, no economy in 
their flight. He thought meanly of the modern 
theatre and yet he had discovered a fund of satis- 



 563 

faction in the most promising of its exponents ; 
so that Sherringham more than once said to him 
that he should really, to keep his opinions at all 
in hand, attach more value to the stage or less 
to the interesting actress. Miriam made infinitely 
merry at his expense and treated him as the 
most abject of her slaves: all of which was 
worth seeing as an exhibition, on Nash s part, of 
the imperturbable. When Sherringham mentally 
pronounced him impudent he felt guilty of an 
injustice Nash had so little the air of a man 
with something to gain Nevertheless he felt a 
certain itching in his boot-toe when his fellow- 
visitor exclaimed, explicatively (in general to Mir 
iam herself), in answer to a charge of tergiver 
sation : " Oh, it s all right ; it s the voice, you 
know the enchanting voice!" He meant by 
this, as indeed he more fully set forth, that he 
came to the theatre, or to the villa in St. John s 
Wood, simply to treat his ear to the sound (the 
richest then to be heard on earth, as he main 
tained) issuing from Miriam s lips. Its richness 
was quite independent of the words she might 
pronounce or the poor fable they might subserve, 
and if the pleasure of hearing her in public was 
the greater by reason of the larger volume of her 
utterance, it was still highly agreeable to see her 
at home, for it was there that the artistic nature 
that he freely conceded to her came out most. 
He spoke as if she had been formed by the 
bounty of nature to be his particular recreation, 



564  

and as if, being an expert in innocent joys, he 
took his pleasure wherever he found it. 

He was perpetually in the field, sociable, ami 
able, communicative, inveterately contradicted but 
never confounded, ready to talk to any one about 
anything and making disagreement (of which he 
left the responsibility wholly to others) a basis of 
intimacy. Every one knew what he thought of 
the theatrical profession, and yet it could not be 
said that he did not regard its members as the 
exponents of comedy, inasmuch as he often eli 
cited their foibles in a way that made even Sher- 
ringham laugh, notwithstanding his attitude of re 
serve where Nash was concerned. At any rate, 
though he had committed himself on the sub 
ject of the general fallacy of their attempt, he 
put up with their company, for the sake of Mir 
iam s accents, with a practical philosophy that 
was all his own. Miriam pretended that he was 
her supreme, her incorrigible adorer, masquerad 
ing as a critic to save his vanity and tolerated for 
his secret constancy in spite of being a bore. To 
Sherringham he was not a bore, and the secre 
tary of embassy felt a certain displeasure at not 
being able to regard him as one. He had seen 
too many strange countries and curious things, 
observed and explored too much, to be void of 
illustration. Peter had a suspicion that if he 
himself was in the grandes espaces Gabriel Nash 
probably had a still wider range. If among Mir 
iam s associates Basil Dashwood dragged him 



 565 

down, Gabriel challenged him rather to higher and 
more fantastic flights. If he saw the girl in larger 
relations than the young actor, who mainly saw her 
in ill-written parts, Nash went a step further and 
regarded her, irresponsibly and sublimely, as a 
priestess of harmony, with whom the vulgar ideas 
of success and failure had nothing to do. He 
laughed at her " parts," holding that without 
them she would be great. Sherringham envied 
him his power to content himself with the plea 
sures he could get : he had a shrewd impression 
that contentment was not destined to be the 
sweetener of his own repast. 

Above all Nash held his attention by a con 
stant element of unstudied reference to Nick 
Dormer, who, as we know, had suddenly become 
much more interesting to his cousin. Sherring 
ham found food for observation, and in some 
measure for perplexity, in the relations of all 
these clever people with each other. He knew 
why his sister, who had a personal impatience 
of unapplied ideas, had not been agreeably af 
fected by Mr. Nash and had not viewed with 
complacency a predilection for him in the man 
she was to marry. This was a side by which he 
had no desire to resemble Julia Dallow, for he 
needed no teaching to divine that Gabriel had 
not set her intelligence in motion. He, Peter, 
would have been sorry to have to confess that 
he could not understand him. He understood, 
furthermore, that Miriam, in Nick s studio, might 



566  

very well have appeared to Julia a formidable 
power. She was younger, but she had quite as 
much her own form, and she was beautiful 
enough to have made Nick compare her with 
Mrs. Dallow even if he had been in love with 
that lady a pretension as to which Peter had 
private ideas. 

Sherringham, for many days, saw nothing of 
the member for Harsh, though it might have 
been said that, by implication, he participated in 
the life of Balaklava Place. Had Nick given 
Julia tangible grounds, and was his unexpectedly 
fine rendering of Miriam an act of virtual infidel 
ity ? In that case, in what degree was Miriam 
to be regarded as an accomplice in his defection, 
and what was the real nature of this young lady s 
esteem for her new and (as he might be called) 
distinguished ally ? These questions would have 
given Peter still more to think about if he had 
not flattered himself that he had made up his 
mind that they concerned Nick and Miriam infi 
nitely more than they concerned him. Miriam 
was personally before him, so that he had no 
need to consult, for his pleasure, his fresh recol 
lection of the portrait. But he thought of this 
striking production each time he thought of his 
enterprising kinsman. And that happened often, 
for in his hearing Miriam often discussed the 
happy artist and his possibilities with Gabriel 
Nash, and Gabriel broke out about them to Mir 
iam. The girl s tone on the subject was frank 



 567 

and simple : she only said, with an iteration that 
was slightly irritating, that Mr. Dormer had been 
tremendously kind to her. She never mentioned 
Julia s irruption to Julia s brother ; she only re 
ferred to the portrait, with inscrutable amenity, 
as a direct consequence of Peter s fortunate sug 
gestion that first day at Madame Carry s. Gabriel 
Nash, however, showed such a disposition to ex 
patiate, sociably and luminously, on the peculiarly 
interesting character of what he called Dormer s 
predicament and on the fine suspense which it 
was fitted to kindle in the breast of discerning 
friends, that Peter wondered, as I have already 
hinted, if this insistence were not a subtle per 
versity, a devilish little invention to torment a 
man whose jealousy was presumable. Yet on the 
whole Nash struck him as but scantily devilish 
and as still less occupied with the prefigurement 
of his emotions. Indeed, he threw a glamour of 
romance over Nick ; tossed off such illuminating 
yet mystifying references to him that Sherring- 
ham found himself capable of a magnanimous cu 
riosity, a desire to follow out the chain of events. 
He learned from Gabriel that Nick was still away, 
and he felt as if he could almost submit to in 
struction, to initiation. The rare charm of these 
unregulated days was troubled it ceased to be 
idyllic when, late on the evening of the second 
Sunday, he walked away with Gabriel, southward, 
from St. John s Wood. For then something 
came out. 



XXXII. 

IT mattered not so much what the doctors 
thought (and Sir Matthew Hope, the greatest of 
them all, had been down twice in one week) as 
that Mr. Chayter, the omniscient butler, declared 
with all the authority of his position and his ex 
perience that Mr. Carteret was very bad indeed. 
Nick Dormer had a long talk with him (it lasted 
six minutes) the day he hurried to Beauclere in 
response to a telegram. It was Mr. Chayter who 
had taken upon himself to telegraph, in spite of 
the presence in the house of Mr. Carteret s near 
est re ation and only surviving sister, Mrs. Len- 
don. This lady, a large, milcl, healthy woman, 
with a heavy tread, who liked early breakfasts, 
uncomfortable chairs and the advertisement- 
sheet of the " Times," had arrived the week be 
fore and was awaiting the turn of events. She 
was a widow and lived in Cornwall, in a house 
nine miles from a station, which had, to make up 
for this inconvenience, as she had once told Nick, 
a delightful old herbaceous garden. She was ex 
tremely fond of an herbaceous garden ; her prin 
cipal interest was in that direction. Nick had 
often seen her she came to Beauclere once or 
twice a year. Her sojourn there made no great 



 569 

difference ; she was only an " Urania, dear," for 
Mr. Carteret to look across the table at when, on 
the close of dinner, it was time for her to retire. 
She went out of the room always as if it were 
after some one else ; and on the gentlemen "join 
ing " her later (the junction was not very close) 
she received them with an air of gratified sur 
prise. 

Chayter honored Nick Dormer with a regard 
which approached, without improperly competing 
with it, the affection his master had placed on 
the same young head, and Chayter knew a good 
many things. Among them he knew his place ; 
but it was wonderful how little that knowledge 
had rendered him inaccessible to other kinds. 
He took upon himself to send for Nick without 
speaking to Mrs. Lendon, whose influence was 
now a good deal like that of a large occasional 
piece of furniture, which had been introduced in 
case it should be required. She was one of the 
solid conveniences that a comfortable house 
would have ; but you could n t talk with a ma 
hogany sofa or a folding screen. Chayter knew 
how much she had " had " from her brother, and 
how much her two daughters had each received on 
marriage ; and he was of the opinion that it was 
quite enough, especially considering the society 
in which they (you could scarcely call it) moved. 
He knew, beyond this, that they would all have 
more, and that was why he hesitated little about 
communicating with Nick. If Mrs. Lendon 



570  

should be ruffled at the intrusion of a young man 
who neither was the child of a cousin nor had 
been formally adopted, Chayter was parliamentary 
enough to see that the forms of debate were ob 
served. He had indeed a slightly compassionate 
sense that Mrs. Lendon was not easily ruffled. 
She was always down an extraordinary time be 
fore breakfast (Chayter refused to take it as in 
the least admonitory), but she usually went 
straight into the garden (as if to see that none of 
the plants had been stolen in the night), and had 
in the end to be looked for by the footman in 
some out-of-the-way spot behind the shrubbery, 
where, plumped upon the ground, she was doing 
something " rum " to a flower. 

Mr. Carteret himself had expressed no wishes. 
He slept mcst of the time (his failure at the last 
had been sudden, but he was rheumatic and sev 
enty-seven), and the situation was in Chayter s 
hands. Sir Matthew Hope had opined, even on 
his second visit, that he would rally and go on, in 
rudimentary comfort, some time longer ; but 
Chayter took a different and a still more intimate 
view. Nick was embarrassed : he scarcely knew 
what be was there for from the moment he could 
give his good old friend no conscious satisfaction. 
The doctors, the nurses, the servants, Mrs. Len 
don, and above all the settled equilibrium of the 
square, thick house, where an immutable order 
appeared to slant through the polished windows 
and tinkle in the quieter bells, all represented 



, 571 

best the kind of supreme solace to which the 
master was most accessible. 

For the first day it was judged better that Nick 
should not be introduced into the darkened 
chamber. This was the decision of the two de 
corous nurses, of whom the visitor had had a 
glimpse, and who, with their black uniforms and 
fresh faces of business, suggested a combination 
of the barmaid and the nun. He was depressed, 
yet restless, felt himself in a false position and 
thought it lucky Mrs. Lendon had powers of 
placid acceptance. They were old acquaintances : 
she treated him with a certain ceremony, but it 
was not the rigor of mistrust. It was much more 
an expression of remote Cornish respect for 
young abilities and distinguished connections, in 
asmuch as she asked him a great deal about Lady 
Agnes and about Lady Flora and Lady Elizabeth. 
He knew she was kind and ungrudging, and his 
principal chagrin was the sense of meagre infor 
mation and of responding poorly in regard to his 
uninteresting aunts. He sat in the garden with 
newspapers and looked at the lowered blinds in 
Mr. Carteret s windows ; he wandered around the 
abbey with cigarettes, and lightened his tread 
and felt grave, wishing that everything were over. 
He would have liked much to see Mr. Carteret 
again, but he had no desire that Mr. Carteret 
should see him. In the evening he dined with 
Mrs. Lendon, and she talked to him, at his re 
quest, and as much as she could, about her bro- 



5/2  

ther s early years, his beginnings of life. She was 
so much younger that they appeared to have been 
rather a tradition of her own youth ; but her talk 
made Nick feel how tremendously different Mr. 
Carteret had been at that period from what he, 
Nick, was to-day. He had published, at the age 
of thirty, a little volume (it was thought wonder 
fully clever) called " The Incidence of Rates ; " 
but Nick had not yet collected the material for 
any such treatise. After dinner Mrs. Lendon, 
who was in full dress, retired to the drawing-room, 
where, at the end of ten minutes, she was fol 
lowed by Nick, who had remained behind only 
because he thought Chayter would expect it. 
Mrs. Lendon almost shook hands with him again, 
and then Chayter brought in coffee. Almost in 
no time afterwards he brought in tea, and the oc 
cupants of the drawing-room sat for a slow half- 
hour, during which the lady looked round at the 
apartment with a sigh and said: "Don t you 
think poor Charles had exquisite taste ? " 

Fortunately, at this moment, the " local man " 
was ushered in. He had been up-stairs, and he 
entered, smiling, with the remark, " It s quite 
wonderful it s quite wonderful." What was 
wonderful was a marked improvement in the 
breathing, a distinct indication of revival. The 
doctor had some tea, and he chatted for a quarter 
of an hour in a way that showed what a " good " 
manner and how large an experience a local man 
could have. When he went away Nick walked 



THE 7KAGIC MUSE. 573 

out with him. The doctor s house was near by 
and he had come on foot. He left Nick with the 
assurance that in all probability Mr. Carteret, 
who was certainly picking up, would be able to 
see him on the morrow. Our young man turned 
his steps again to the abbey and took a stroll 
about it in the starlight. It never looked so huge 
as when it reared itself into the night, and Nick 
had never felt more fond of it than on this occa 
sion, more comforted and confirmed by its beauty. 
When he came back he was readmitted by Chay- 
ter, who surveyed him in respectful deprecation 
of the frivolity which had led him to attempt to 
help himself through such an evening in such a 
way. 

Nick went to bed early and slept badly, which 
was unusual with him ; but it was a pleasure 
to him to be told almost as soon as he came out 
of his room that Mr. Carteret had asked for him. 
He went in to see him, and was struck with the 
change in his appearance. He had, however, 
spent a day with him just after the New Year, 
and another at the beginning of March, so that 
he had perceived the first symptoms of mortal 
alteration. A week after Julia Dallow s depar 
ture for the Continent Nick had devoted several 
hours to Beauclere and to the intention of telling 
his old friend how the happy event had been 
brought to naught the advantage that he had 
been so good as to desire for him and to make 
the condition of a splendid gift. Before this, for 



5/4  

a few days, Nick had been keeping back, to an 
nounce it personally, the good news that Julia 
had at last set their situation in order : he wanted 
to enjoy the old man s pleasure so sore a trial 
had her arbitrary behavior been for a year. Mrs. 
Dallow had offered Mr. Carteret a conciliatory 
visit before Christmas had come down from 
London one day to lunch with him, but only 
with the effect of making him subsequently ex 
hibit to poor Nick, as the victim of her whimsi 
cal hardness, a great deal of earnest commisera 
tion in a jocose form. Upon his honor, as he 
said, she was as clever and " specious" a woman 
(this was the odd expression he used) as he had 
ever seen in his life. The merit of her behavior 
on this occasion, as Nick knew, was that she had 
not been specious at her lover s expense : she 
had breathed no doubt of his public purpose and 
had had the feminine courage to say that in truth 
she was older than he, so that it was only fair to 
give his affections time to mature. But when 
Nick saw their sympathizing host after the rup 
ture that I lately narrated, he found him in no 
state to encounter a disappointment : he was se 
riously ailing, it was the beginning of worse 
things and no time for trying on a sensation. 
After this excursion Nick went back to town sad 
dened by Mr. Carteret s now unmistakably set 
tled decline, but rather relieved that he had not 
been forced to make his confession. It had even 
occurred to him that the need for making it 



 575 

might not come up if the ebb of his old friend s 
strength should continue unchecked. He might 
pass away in the persuasion that everything 
would happen as he wished it, though indeed 
without enriching Nick on his wedding-day to 
the tune that he had promised. Very likely he 
had made legal arrangements in virtue of which 
his bounty would take effect in the right condi 
tions and in them alone. At present Nick had 
a larger confession to treat him to the last 
three days had made the difference ; but, oddly 
enough, though his responsibility had increased 
his reluctance to speak had vanished : he was 
positively eager to clear up a situation over which 
it was not consistent with his honor to leave a 
shade. 

The doctor had been right when he came in 
after dinner ; it was clear in the morning that 
they had not seen the last of Mr. Carteret s 
power of picking up. Chayter, who had been in 
to see him, refused austerely to change his opin 
ion with every change in his master s tempera 
ture ; but the nurses took the cheering view that 
it would do their patient good for Mr. Dormer to 
sit with him a little. One of them remained in 
the room, in the deep window-seat, and Nick 
spent twenty minutes by the bedside. It was 
not a -case for much conversation, but Mr. Car- 
teret seemed to like to look at him. There was 
life in his kind old eyes, which would express it 
self yet in some further wise provision. He laid 



576  

his liberal hand on Nick s with a confidence 
which showed it was not yet disabled. He said 
very little, and the nurse had recommended that 
the visitor himself should not overflow in speech ; 
but from time to time he murmured, with a faint 
smile : " To-night s division, you know you 
must n t miss it." There was to be no division 
that night, as it happened, but even Mr. Carter- 
et s aberrations were parliamentary. Before Nick 
left him he had been able to assure him that he 
was rapidly getting better, that such valuable 
hours must not be wasted. " Come back on 
Friday, if they come to the second reading." 
These were the words with which Nick was dis 
missed, and at noon the doctor said the invalid 
was doing very well, but that Nick had belter 
leave him alone for that day. Our young man 
accordingly determined to go up to town for the 
night, and even, if he should receive no sum 
mons, for the next day. He arranged with Chay- 
ter that he should be telegraphed to if Mr. Car- 
teret were either better or worse. 

" Oh, he can t very well be worse, sir," Chay- 
ter replied, inexorably ; but he relaxed so far as 
to remark that of course it would n t do for Nick 
to neglect the House. 

" Oh, the House ! " Nick sighed, ambiguously, 
avoiding the butler s eye. It would be easy 
enough to tell Mr. Carteret, but nothing would 
have sustained him in the effort to make a clean 
breast to Chayter. 



 577 

He might be ambiguous about the House, but 
he had the sense of things to be done awaiting 
him in London. He telegraphed to his servant 
and spent that night in Rosedale Road. The 
things to be done were apparently to be done 
in his studio : his servant met him there with a 
large bundle of letters. He failed that evening 
to stray within two miles of Westminster, and the 
legislature of his country reassembled without 
his support. The next morning he received a 
telegram from Chayter, to whom he had given 
Rosedale Road as an address. This missive 
simply informed him that Mr. Carteret wished to 
see him, and it seemed to imply that he was bet 
ter, though Chayter would n t say so. Nick again 
took his place in the train to Beauclere. He 
had been there very often, but it was present to 
him that now, after a little, he should go only 
once more, for a particular dismal occasion. All 
that was over everything that belonged to it 
was over. He learned on his arrival he saw 
Mrs. Lendon immediately that his old friend 
had continued to pick up. He had expressed a 
strong and a perfectly rational desire to talk with 
Nick, and the doctor had said that if it was about 
anything important it was much better not to op 
pose him. " He says it s about something very 
important," Mrs. Lendon remarked, resting shy 
eyes on him while she added that she was looking 
after her brother for the hour. She had sent 
those wonderful young ladies out to see the 



5/8  

abbey. Nick paused with her outside of Mr. Car- 
teret s door. He wanted to say something com 
fortable to her in return for her homely charity 
give her a hint, which she was far from looking 
for, that practically he had now no interest in her 
brother s estate. This was impossible, of course. 
Her absence of irony gave him no pretext, and 
such an illusion would bean insult to her simple 
discretion. She was either not thinking of his 
interest at all, or she was thinking of it with the 
tolerance of a mind trained to a hundred decent 
submissions. Nick looked for an instant into 
her mild, uninvestigating eyes, and it came over 
him, supremely, that the goodness -of these peo 
ple was singularly pure : they were a part of what 
was cleanest and sanest and dullest in humanity. 
There had been just a little mocking inflection in 
Mrs. Lendon s pleasant voice ; but it was dedi 
cated to the young ladies in the black uniforms 
(she could perhaps be satirical about them), and 
not to the theory of the "importance " of Nick s 
interview with her brother. Nick s arrested de 
sire to let her know he was not dangerous trans 
lated itself into a vague friendliness and into the 
abrupt, rather bewildering words, " I can t tell 
you half the good I think of you." As he passed 
into Mr. Carteret s room it occurred to him that 
she would perhaps interpret this speech as an 
acknowledgment of obligation of her good 
nature in not keeping him away from the rich 
old man. 



XXXIII. 

MR. CARTERET was propped up on pillows, and 
in this attitude, beneath the high, spare canopy 
of his bed, presented himself to Nick s picture- 
seeking vision as a figure in a clever composition 
or a novel. He had gathered strength, though 
this strength was not much in his voice; it was 
mainly in his brighter eye and his air of being 
pleased with himself. He put out his hand and 
said, " I dare say you know why I sent for you ; " 
upon which Nick sank into the seat he had occu 
pied the day before, replying that he had been de 
lighted to come, whatever the reason. Mr. Car- 
teret said nothing more about the division or the 
second reading ; he only murmured that they 
were keeping the newspapers for him. " I m 
rather behind I m rather behind," he went on ; 
"but two or three quiet mornings will make it all 
right. You can go back to-night, you know 
you can easily go back." This was the only 
thing not quite straight that Nick saw in him, 
his making light of his young friend s flying to 
and fro. Nick sat looking at him with a sense 
that was half compunction and half the idea o f 
the rare beauty of his face, to which, strangely, 
the waste ,of illness now seemed to have restored 



580  

some of its youth. Mr. Carteret was evidently 
conscious that this morning he should not be 
able to go on long, so that he must be practical 
and concise. " I dare say you know you have 
only to remember," he continued. 

"You know what a pleasure it is to me to 
see you there can be no better reason than 
that." 

"Hasn t the year come round the year of 
that foolish arrangement ? " 

Nick thought a little, asking himself if it were 
really necessary to disturb his companion s ear 
nest faith. Then the consciousness of the falsity 
of his own position surged over him again, and he 
replied : " Do you mean the period for which 
Mrs. Dallow insisted on keeping me dangling ? 
Oh, that s over." 

"And are you married has it come off?" 
the old man asked, eagerly. " How long have I 
been ill?" 

" We are uncomfortable, unreasonable people, 
not deserving of your interest. We are not mar 
ried," Nick said. 

"Then I haven t been ill so long," Mr. Car 
teret sighed, with vague relief. 

"Not very long but things are different," 
Nick continued. 

The old man s eyes rested on his, and Nick 
noted how much larger they appeared. "You 
mean the arrangements are made the day is at 
hand?" 



 581 

"There are no arrangements," Nick smiled: 
"but why should it trouble you ? " 

" What then will you do without arrange 
ments ? " Mr. Carteret s inquiry was plaintive and 
childlike. 

" We shall do. nothing there is nothing to be 
done. We are not to be married it s all off," 
said Nick. Then he added : " Mrs. Dallow has 
gone abroad." 

The old man, motionless among his pillows, 
gave a long groan. " Ah, I don t like that." 

" No more do I, sir." 

"What s the matter? It was so good so 
good." 

" It was n t good enough for her," Nick Dormer 
declared. 

" For her ? Is she so great as that ? She told 
me she had the greatest regard for you. You re 
good enough for the best, my dear boy," Mr. 
Carteret went on. 

" You don t know me ; I am disappointing. 
Mrs. Dallow had, I believe, a great regard for 
me, but I have forfeited her regard." 

The old man stared, at this cynical announce 
ment : he searched his companion s face for some 
attenuation of the words. But Nick apparently 
struck him as unashamed ; and a faint color com 
ing into his withered cheek indicated his mystifi 
cation and alarm. " Have you been unfaithful to 
her ?" he demanded, considerately. 

" She thinks so it comes to the same thing. 



582  

As I told you a year ago, she doesn t believe in 
me." 

" You ought to have made her you ought to 
have made her/ said Mr. Carteret Nick was 
about to utter some rejoinder when he continued : 
"Do you remember what I told you I would cive 
you, if you did ? Do you remember what I told 
you I would give you on your wedding-day ? " 

" You expressed the most generous intentions ; 
and I remember them as much as a man may do 
who has no wish to remind you of them." 

" The money is there I have put it aside." 

"I haven t earned it I haven t earned a 
penny of it. Give it to those who deserve it 
more." 

" I don t understand I don t understand," 
Mr. Carteret murmured, with the tears of weak 
ness coming into his eyes. His face flushed and 
he added : " I m not good for much discussion ; 
I m very much disappointed." 

" I think I may say it s not my fault I have 
done what I can," returned Nick. 

" But when people are in love they do more 
than that." 

" Oh, it s all over ! " Nick exclaimed ; not car 
ing much now, for the moment, how disconcerted 
his companion might be, so long as he disabused 
him of the idea that they were partners to a bar 
gain. " We ve tormented each other and we ve 
tormented you ; and that is all that has come of 
it" 



 583 

" Don t you care for what I would have done 
for you should n t you have liked it ? " 

"Of course one likes kindness one likes 
money. But it s all over," Nick repeated. Then 
he added : " I fatigue you, I knock you up, with 
telling you these uncomfortable things. I only 
do so because it seems to me right you should 
know. But don t be worried everything will 
be all right." 

He patted his companion s hand reassuringly, 
he leaned over him affectionately ; but Mr. Car- 
teret was not easily soothed. He had practiced 
lucidity all his life, he had expected it of others, 
and he had never given his assent to an indistinct 
proposition. He was weak, but he was not too 
weak to perceive that he had formed a calculation 
which was now vitiated by a wrong factor put 
his name to a contract of which the other side 
had not been carried out. More than fifty years 
of conscious success pressed him to try to under 
stand ; he had never muddled his affairs and he 
could n t muddle them now. At the same time 
he was aware of the necessity of economizing his 
effort, and he evidently gathered himself, within, 
patiently and almost cunningly, for the right 
question and the right induction. He was still 
able to make his agitation reflective, and it could 
still consort with his high hopes of Nick that 
he should find himself regarding the declara 
tion that everything would be all right as an in 
adequate guarantee. So, after he had looked 



584  

a moment into his companion s eyes, he in 
quired : 

" Have you done anything bad ?" 

" Nothing worse than usual," laughed Nick. 

" Everything should have been better than 
usual." 

" Ah, well, it has n t been that that I must 
say." 

" Do you sometimes think of your father ? " 
Mr. Carteret continued. 

Nick hesitated a moment. " You make me 
think of him you have always that pleasant 
effect." 

" His name would have lived it must n t be 

lost." 

" Yes, but the competition to-day is terrible," 
Nick replied. 

Mr. Carteret considered this a moment, as if 
he found a serious flaw in it ; after which he be 
gan again : " I never supposed you were a trifler." 

" I m determined not to be." 

" I thought her charming. Don t you love 
her ? " Mr. Carteret asked. 

" Don t ask me that to-day, for I feel sore and 
resentful. I don t think she has treated me well." 

" You should have held her you should n t 
have let her go," the old man returned, with un 
expected fire. 

His companion flushed, at this, so strange it 
seemed to him to receive a lesson in energy from 
a dying octogenarian. Yet after an instant Nick 



 585 

answered, modestly enough: "I haven t been 
clever enough, no doubt." 

" Don t say that don t say that," Mr. Carteret 
murmured, looking almost frightened. "Don t 
think I can allow you any mitigation of that sort. 
I know how well you ve done. You re taking 
your place. Several gentlemen have told me. 
Has n t she felt a scruple, knowing my settlement 
on you was contingent?" he pursued. 

" Oh, she has n t known has n t known any 
thing about it." 

" I don t understand ; though I think you ex 
plained somewhat, a year ago," Mr. Carteret said, 
with discouragement. "I think she wanted to 
speak to me of any intentions I might have, in 
regard to you the day she was here. Very 
nicely, very properly, she would have done it, 
I m sure, I think her idea was that I ought to 
make any settlement quite independent of your 
marrying her or not marrying her. But I tried to 
convey to her I don t know whether she under 
stood me that I liked her too much for that, I 
wanted too much to make sure of her." 

" To make sure of me, you mean," said Nick. 
"And now, after all, you see you haven t." 

"Well, perhaps it was that," sighed the old 
man, confusedly. 

"All this is very bad for you we ll talk 
again," Nick rejoined. 

" No, no let us finish it now. I like to know 
what I m doing. I shall rest better when I do 



586  

know. There are great things to be done ; the 
future will be full the future will be fine," Mr. 
Carteret wandered. 

" Let me say this for Julia : that if we had n t 
been sundered her generosity to me would have 
been complete, she would have put her great for 
tune absolutely at my disposal," Nick said, after 
a moment. " Her consciousness of all that nat 
urally carries her over any particular distress in 
regard to what won t come to me now from an 
other source." 

"Ah, don t lose it," pleaded the old man, pain 
fully. 

" It s in your hands, sir," reasoned Nick. 

" I mean Mrs. Dallow s fortune. It will be of 
the highest utility. That was what your father 
missed." 

" I shall miss more than my father did," said 
Nick. 

" She 11 come back to you I can t look at 
you and doubt that." 

Nick shook his head slowly, smiling. " Never, 
never, never ! You look at me, my grand old 
friend, but you don t see me. I m not what you 
think." 

" What is it what is it ? Have you been 
bad ? " Mr. Carteret panted. 

" No, no ; I m not bad. But I m different." 

" Different ? " 

" Different from my father different from 
Mrs. Dallow different from you." 



 587 

"Ah, why do you perplex me? " moaned the 
old man. " You ve done something." 

" I don t want to perplex you, but I have done 
something," said Nick, getting up. 

He had heard the door open softly behind him 
and Mrs. Lendon come forward with precautions. 
" What has he done what has he done ? " qua 
vered Mr. Carteret to his sister. She, however, 
after a glance at the patient, motioned Nick 
away, and, bending over the bed, replied, in a 
voice expressive at that moment of a sharply 
contrasted plenitude of vital comfort : 

" He has only excited you, I m afraid, a little 
more than is good for you. Is n t your dear old 
head a little too high ? " Nick regarded himself 
as justly banished, and he quitted the room with 
a ready acquiescence in any power to carry on 
the scene of which Mrs. Lendon might find her 
self possessed. He felt distinctly brutal as he 
heard his host emit a soft, troubled exhalation of 
assent to some change of position. But he would 
have reproached himself more if he had wished 
less to guard against the acceptance of an equiv 
alent for duties unperformed. Mr. Carteret had 
had in his mind, characteristically, the idea of an 
enlightened agreement, and there was something 
more to be said about that. 

Nick went out of the house and stayed away 
for two or three hours, quite ready to consider 
that the place was quieter and safer without him. 
He haunted the abbey, as usual, and sat a long 



588  

time in its simplifying stillness, turning over 
many things. He came into the house again at 
the luncheon-hour, through the garden, and heard, 
somewhat to his surprise and greatly to his relief, 
that Mr. Carteret had composed himself promptly 
enough after their agitating interview. Mrs. Len- 
don talked at luncheon much as if she expected 
her brother to be, as she said, really quite fit 
again. She asked Nick no embarrassing ques 
tion ; which was uncommonly good of her, he 
thought, considering that she might have said, 
" What in the world were you trying to get out 
of him ? " She only told our young man that the 
invalid had very little doubt he should be able to 
see him again, about half past seven, for a very 
short time : this gentle emphasis was Mrs. Len- 
don s single tribute to the critical spirit. Nick 
divined that Mr. Carteret s desire for further 
explanations was really strong and had been ca 
pable of sustaining him through a bad morning 
capable even of helping him (it would be a secret 
and wonderful momentary victory over his weak 
ness) to pass it off for a good one. He wished 
he might make a sketch of him, from the life, as 
he had seen him after breakfast ; he had a con 
viction he could make a strong one, and it would 
be a precious memento. But he shrank from pro 
posing this Mr. Carteret might think it un 
parliamentary. The doctor had called while Nick 
was out, and he came again at five o clock, with 
out our young man s seeing him. Nick was busy, 



 589 

in his room, at that hour : he wrote a short letter 
which took him a long time. But apparently 
there had been no veto on a resumption of talk, 
for at half past seven the old man sent for him. 
The nurse, at the door, said, " Only a moment, 
I hope, sir?" but she took him in and then 
withdrew. 

The prolonged daylight was in the room, and 
Mr. Carteret was again established on his pile 
of pillows, but with his head a little lower. Nick 
sat down by him and began to express the hope 
that he had not upset him in the morning ; but 
the old man, with fixed, expanded eyes, took 
up their conversation exactly where they had 
left it. 

" What have you done what have you done ? 
Have you associated yourself with some other 
woman ? " 

" No, no ; I don t think she can accuse me of 
that." 

"Well, then, she ll come back to you, if you 
take the right way with her." 

It might have been droll to hear Mr. Carteret, 
in his situation, giving his views on the right way 
with women ; but Nick was not moved to enjoy 
that diversion. " I ve taken the wrong way. 
I ve done something which will spoil my pros 
pects in that direction forever. I ve written a 
letter," Nick went on ; but his companion had 
already interrupted him. 

" You ve written a letter ? " 



590  

"To my constituents, informing them of my 
determination to resign my seat." 

" To resign your seat ? " 

" I ve made up my mind, after no end of re 
flection, dear Mr. Carteret, to work in a different 
line. I have a project of becoming a painter. 
So I ve given up the idea of a political life." 

"A painter?" Mr. Carteret seemed to turn 
whiter. 

" I m going in for the portrait, in oils : it 
sounds absurd, I know, and I only mention it to 
show you that I don t in the least expect you to 
count upon me." Mr. Carteret had continued to 
stare, at first ; then his eyes slowly closed and he 
lay motionless and blank. " Don t let it trouble 
you now ; it s a long story and rather a poor 
one ; when you get better I 11 tell you all about it. 
We 11 talk it o/er amicably, and I 11 bring you to 
my side," Nick went on, hypocritically. He had 
laid his hand on Mr. Carteret s again : it felt 
colcl, and as the old man remained silent he had 
a moment of exaggerated fear. 

" This is dreadful news," said Mr. Carteret, 
opening his eyes. 

"Certainly it must seem so to you, for I ve 
always kept from you (I was ashamed, and my 
present confusion is a just chastisement) the 
great interest I have always taken in the " 
Nick hesitated, and then added, with an intention 
of humor and a sense of foolishness " in the 
pencil and the brush." He spoke of his present 



 591 

confusion ; but it must be confessed that his 
manner showed it but little. He was surprised 
at his own serenity, and had to recognize that at 
the point things had come to now he was pro 
foundly obstinate and quiet. 

" The pencil the brush ? They re not the 
weapons of a gentleman," said Mr. Carteret. 

" I was sure that would be your view. I repeat 
that I mention them only because you once s aid 
you intended to do something for me, as the 
phrase is, and I thought you ought n t to do it in 
ignorance." 

"My ignorance was better. Such knowledge 
is n t good for me." 

" Forgive me, my dear old friend. When you 
are better you ll see it differently." 

" I shall never be better now." 

"Ah, no," pleaded Nick, "it will do you good, 
after a little. Think it over quietly, and you ll 
be glad I ve stopped being a humbug." 

" I loved you I loved you as my son," 
moaned the old man. 

Nick sank on his knee beside the bed and 
leaned over him tenderly. " Get better, get bet 
ter, and I 11 be your son for the rest of your life." 

" Poor Dormer poor Dormer ! " Mr. Carteret 
softly wailed. 

"I admit that if he had lived I probably 
should n t have done it," said Nick. " I dare say 
I should have deferred to his prejudices, even if 
I thought them narrow." 



59 2  

"Do you turn against your father?" Mr. Car 
teret asked, making, to disengage his arm from 
the young man s touch, an effort in which Nick 
recognize! the irritation of conscious weakness. 
Nick got up, at this, and stood a moment looking 
down at him, while Mr. Carteret went on : " Do 
you give up your name, do you give up your coun 
try ? " 

" If I do something good my country may like 
it," Nick contended. 

" Do you regard them as equal, the two 
glories ? " 

"Here comes your nurse, to blow me up and 
turn me out," said Nick. 

The nurse had come in, but Mr. Carteret man 
aged to direct to her an audible, dry, courteous 
" Be so good as to wait till I send for you," which 
arrested her, in the large room, at some distance 
from the bed, and then had the effect of making 
her turn on her heel with a professional laugh. 
She appeared to think that an old gentleman 
with the fine manner of his prime might still be 
trusted to take care of himself. When she had 
gone Mr. Carteret went on, addressing Nick, with 
the inquiry for which his deep displeasure lent 
him strength : " Do you pretend there is a no 
bler life than a high political career ? " 

" I think the noble life is doing one s work 
well. One can do it very ill, and be very base 
and mean, in what you call a high political career. 
I have n t been in the House so many months 



 593 

without finding that out. It contains some very 
small souls." 

"You should stand against them you should 
expose them ! " stammered Mr. Carteret. 

" Stand against them, against one s own 
party ? " 

The old man looked bewildered, a moment, at 
this ; then he broke out : " God forgive you, are 
you a Tory are you a Tory ? " 

" How little you understand me ! " laughed 
Nick, with a ring of bitterness. 

" Little enough little enough, my boy. Have 
you sent your electors your dreadful letter ? " 

" Not yet ; but it s all ready, and I sha n t 
change my mind." 

"You will you will; you ll think better of 
it, you 11 see your duty," said the old man, al 
most coaxingly. 

"That seems very improbable, for my determi 
nation, crudely and abruptly as, to my great re 
gret, it comes to you here, is the fruit of a long 
and painful struggle. The difficulty is that I see 
my duty just in this other effort." 

" An effort ? Do you call it an effort to fall 
away, to sink far down, to give up every effort ? 
What does your mother say, heaven help her ? " 
Mr. Carteret pursued, before Nick could answer 
the other question. 

" I have n t told her yet." 

" You re ashamed, you re ashamed ! " Nick 
only looked out of the western window, at this ; 



594  

he felt himself growing red. " Tell her it would 
have been sixty thousand ; I had the money all 
ready." 

"I sha n t tell her that," said Nick, redder 
still. 

" Poor woman poor dear woman ! " Mr. Car- 
teret whimpered. 

Yes, indeed ; she won t like it." 

"Think it all over again; don t throw away 
a splendid future ! " These words were uttered 
with a recovering flicker of passion. Nick Dor 
mer had never heard such an accent on his old 
friend s lips. But the next instant Mr. Carteret 
began to murmur, " I m tired I m very tired," 
and sank back with a groan and with closed lips. 

Nick assured him, tenderly, that he had only 
too much cause to be exhausted, but that the 
worst was over now. He smoothed his pillows 
for him and said he must leave him, he would 
send in the nurse. 

" Come back come back," Mr. Carteret 
pleaded, before he quitted him ; "come back and 
tell me it s a horrible dream." 

Nick did go back, very late that evening ; Mr. 
Carteret had sent a message to his room. But 
one of the nurses was on the ground this time, 
and she remained there, with her watch in her 
hand. The invalid s chamber was shrouded and 
darkened ; the shaded candle left the bed in 
gloom. Nick s interview with his venerable host 
was the affair of but a moment ; the nur$e inter- 



 595 

posed, impatient and not understanding. She 
heard Nick tell Mr. Carteret that he had posted 
his letter now, and Mr. Carteret flashed out, with 
an acerbity which savored still of the sordid asso 
ciations of a world he had not done with : " Then 
of course my settlement does n t take effect ! " 

" Oh, that s all right," Nick answered, kindly ; 
and he went off the next morning by the early 
train his injured host was still sleeping. Mrs. 
Lendon s habits made it easy for her to be pres 
ent, in matutinal bloom, at the young man s hasty 
breakfast, and she sent a particular remembrance 
to Lady Agnes and (when Nick should see them) 
to the Ladies Flora and Elizabeth. Nick had a 
prevision of the spirit in which his mother, at 
least, would now receive hollow compliments 
from Beauclere. 

The night before, as soon as he had quitted 
Mr. Carteret, the old man said to the nurse that 
he wished her to tell Mr. Chayter that, the first 
thing in the morning, he must go and fetch Mr. 
Mitton. Mr. Mitton was the first solicitor at 
Beauclere. 



XXXIV. 

THE really formidable thing, for Nick, was to tell 
his mother: a truth of which he was so conscious 
that he had the matter out with her the very 
morning he returned from Beauclere. She and 
Grace had come back, the afternoon, before, from 
Lady St. Dunstan s, and knowing this (she had 
written him her intention, from the country), he 
drove straight from the station to Calcutta Gar 
dens. There was a little room there, on the right 
of the house-door, which was known as his own 
room, but in which of a morning, when he was 
not at home, Lady Agnes sometimes wrote her 
letters. These were always numerous, and when 
she heard our young man s cab she happened to 
be engaged with them at the big brass-mounted 
bureau which had belonged to his father, where, 
amid a margin of works of political reference, 
she seemed to herself to make public affairs feel 
the point of her elbow. 

She came into the hall to meet her son and to 
hear about Mr. Carteret, and Nick went straight 
back into the room with her and closed the door. 
It would be in the evening paper and she would 
see it, and he had no right to allow her to wait 
for that. It proved indeed a terrible hour ; and 



 597 

when, ten minutes later, Grace, who learned up 
stairs that her brother had come back, went down 
for further news of him, she heard from the hall 
a sound of voices which made her first pause and 
then retrace her steps on tiptoe. She mounted 
to the drawing-room and crept about there, pal 
pitating, looking -at moments into the dull street 
and wondering what on earth was going on. 
She had no one to express her wonder to, for 
Florence Tressilian had departed and Biddy, 
after breakfast, had betaken herself, in accord 
ance with a custom now inveterate, to Rosedale 
Road. Her mother was crying, passionately 
a circumstance tremendous in its significance, 
for Lady Agnes had not often been brought so 
low. Nick had seen her cry, but this almost aw 
ful spectacle had seldom been given to Grace ; 
and it forced her to believe at present that some 
dreadful thing had happened. 

That was of course in order, after Nick s mys 
terious quarrel with Julia, which had made his 
mother so ill and which now apparently had been 
followed up with new horrors. The row, as 
Grace mentally phrased it, had had something to 
do with this incident, some deeper depth of dis 
appointment had opened up. Grace asked her 
self if they were talking about Broadwood ; if 
Nick had demanded that, in the conditions so 
unpleasantly altered, Lady Agnes should restore 
that pretty property to its owner. This was 
very possible, but why should he so suddenly 



598  

have broken out about it ? And moreover their 
mother, though sore to bleeding about the whole 
business for Broadwood, in its fresh comfort, 
was too delightful would not have met this 
pretension with tears, inasmuch as she had al 
ready declared that they could n t decently con 
tinue to make use of the place. Julia had said 
that of course they must go on, but Lady Agnes 
was prepared with an effective rejoinder to this. 
It did n t consist of words it was to be austerely 
practical, was to consist of letting Julia see, at the 
moment she should least expect it, that they quite 
would n t go on. Lady Agnes was ostensibly 
waiting for that moment the moment when 
her renunciation would be most impressive. 

Grace was conscious of how, for many days, 
her mother and she had been moving in dark 
ness, deeply stricken by Nick s culpable (oh, he 
was culpable !) loss of his prize, but feeling there 
was an element in the matter they did n t grasp, 
an undiscovered explanation which would perhaps 
make it still worse, though it might make them 
a little better. Nick had explained nothing ; he 
had simply said, "Dear mother, we don t hit it 
off, after all ; it s an awful bore, but we don t," 
as if that were, under the circumstances, an ade 
quate balm for two aching hearts. From Julia, 
naturally, satisfying attenuations were not to be 
looked for; and though Julia very often did the 
thing you wouldn t suppose she was not unex 
pectedly apologetic in this case. Grace recog- 



 599 

nized that in such a position it would savor of 
apology for her to impart to Lady Agnes her 
grounds for letting Nick off ; and she would not 
have liked to be the person to suggest to Julia 
that any one looked for anything from her. 
Neither of the disunited pair blamed the other 
or cast an aspersion, and it was all very magnani 
mous and superior and impenetrable and exasper 
ating. With all this Grace had a suspicion that 
Biddy knew something more, that for Biddy the 
tormenting curtain had been lifted. 

Biddy came and went, in these days, with a 
perceptible air of detachment from the tribula 
tions of home. It made her, fortunately, very 
pretty still prettier than usual ; it sometimes 
happened that at moments when Grace was most 
angry she had a faint, sweet srnile which might 
have been drawn from a source of private conso 
lation. It was perhaps in some degree connected 
with Peter Sherringham s visit, as to which the 
girl was not silent. When Grace asked her if 
she had secret information and if it pointed to 
the idea that everything would be all right in 
the end, she pretended to know nothing (What 
should she know ? she asked, with the loveliest 
candor), and begged her sister not to let Lady 
Agnes believe that she was any better off than 
they. She contributed nothing to their gropings 
toward the light save a better patience than 
theirs, but she went with noticeable regularity, 
on the pretext of her foolish modeling, to Rose- 



600  

dale Road. She was frankly on Nick s side ; not 
going so far as to say he had been right, but say 
ing distinctly that she was sure that, whatever 
had happened, he couldn t help it. This was 
striking, because, as Grace knew, the younger of 
the sisters had been much favored by Julia and 
would not have sacrificed her easily. It associ 
ated itself in the irritated mind of the elder with 
Biddy s frequent visits to the studio, and made 
Miss Dormer ask herself whether the crisis in 
Nick s and Julia s business had not somehow 
been linked to that unnatural spot. 

She had gone there two or three times, while 
Biddy was working, to pick up any clue to the 
mystery that might peep out. But she had put 
her hand upon nothing, save once on the person 
ality of Gabriel Nash. She found this strange 
creature, to her surprise, paying a visit to her 
sister he had come for Nick, who was absent ; 
she remembered how they had met him in Paris 
and how he had frightened her. When she asked 
Biddy afterwards how she could receive him that 
way, Biddy replied that even she, Grace, would 
have some charity for him if she could hear how 
fond he was of poor Nick. He talked to her 
only of Nick of nothing else. Grace observed 
how she spoke of Nick as injured, and noted the 
implication that some one else had ceased to be 
fond of him and was thereby condemned in 
Biddy s eyes. It seemed to Grace that some one 
else had at least a right not to like some of his 



 6oi 

friends. The studio struck her as mean and 
horrid : and so far from suggesting to her that 
it could have played a part in making Nick and 
Julia fall out, she only felt how little its dusty 
want of consequence could count, one way or the 
other, for Julia. Grace, who had opinions on art, 
saw no merit whatever in those " impressions," 
on canvas, from Nick s hand, with which the 
place was bestrewn. She did n t wish her bro 
ther to have talent in that direction ; yet it 
was secretly humiliating to her that he had not 
more. 

Nick felt a pang of almost horrified penitence, 
in the little room on the right of the hall, the 
moment after he had made his mother really un 
derstand that he had thrown up his seat, that it 
would probably be in the evening papers. That 
she would take it badly was an idea that had 
pressed upon him hard enough ; but she took it 
even worse than he had feared. He measured, 
in the look that she gave him when the full truth 
loomed upon her, the mortal cruelty of her dis 
comfiture ; her face was like that of a passenger 
on a ship who sees the huge bows of another ves 
sel towering close, out of the fog. There are 
visions of dismay before which the best con 
science recoils ; and though Nick had made his 
choice on all the grounds, there were a few min 
utes in which he would gladly have admitted thc-t 
his wisdom was a dark mistake. His heart was 
in his throat, he had gone too far ; he had been 



602  

ready to disappoint his mother he had not 
been ready to destroy her. 

Lady Agnes, I hasten to add, was not de 
stroyed ; she made, after her first drowning gasp, 
a tremendous scene of opposition, in the face of 
which Nick speedily fell back upon his intrench- 
ments. She must know the worst, he had 
thought : so he told her everything, including 
the little story of the forfeiture of his " expecta 
tions " from Mr. Carteret. He showed her this 
time not only the face of the matter, but what 
lay below it ; narrated briefly the incident in his 
studio which had led to Julia Dallow s deciding 
that she could n t after all put up with him. This 
was wholly new to Lady Agnes, she had had no 
clue to it, and he could instantly see how it made 
the case worse for her, adding a hideous positive 
to an abominable negative. He perceived, now, 
that, distressed and distracted as she had been 
by his rupture with Julia, she had still held to 
the faith that their engagement would come on 
again ; believing evidently that he had a personal 
empire over the mistress of Harsh which would 
bring her back. Lady Agnes was forced to rec 
ognize that empire as precarious, to forswear the 
hope of a blessed renewal, from the moment it 
was a question of base infatuations on his own 
part. Nick confessed to an infatuation, but did 
his best to show her it was not base ; that it was 
not (since Julia had had faith in his loyalty) for 
the person of the young lady who had been dis- 



 603 

covered posturing to him and whom he had seen 
but half a dozen times in his life. He endeav 
ored to give his mother a notion of who this 
young lady was and to remind her of the occa 
sion, in Paris, when they all had seen her to 
gether. But Lady Agnes s mind and memory 
were a blank on the subject of Miss Miriam 
Rooth, and she wanted to know nothing whatever 
about her : it was enough that she was the cause 
of their ruin, that she was mixed up with his un 
speakable folly. Her ladyship needed to know 
nothing of Miss Rooth to allude to her as if it 
were superfluous to give a definite name to the 
class to which she belonged. 

But she gave a name to the group in which 
Nick had now taken his place, and it made him 
feel, after the lapse of years, like a small blamed, 
sorry boy again ; for it was so far away he could 
scarcely remember it (besides there having been 
but a moment or two of that sort in his happy 
childhood), the time when his mother had slapped 
him and called him a little fool. He was a big 
fool now a huge, immeasurable one; she re 
peated the term over and over, with high-pitched 
passion. The most painful thing in this painful 
hour was perhaps his glimpse of the strange fem 
inine cynicism that lurked in her fine sense of 
injury. Where there was such a complexity of 
revolt it would have been difficult to pick out 
particular complaints ; but Nick could see that, 
to Lady Agnes s imagination, he was most a fool 



604  

for not having kept his relations with the actress, 
whatever they were, better from Julia s know 
ledge. He remained indeed freshly surprised at 
the ardor with which she had rested her hopes on 
Julia. Julia was certainly a combination she 
was fascinating, she was a sort of leading woman 
and she was rich ; but after all (putting aside what 
she might be to a man in love with her), she 
was not the keystone of the universe. Yet the 
form in which the consequences of his apostasy 
appeared most to come home to Lady Agnes was 
the loss, for the Dormer family, of the advantages 
attached to the possession of Mrs. Dallow. The 
larger mortification would round itself later ; for 
the hour the damning thing was that Nick had 
really made Julia a present of an unforgivable 
grievance. He had clinched their separation by 
his letter to his electors ; and that, above all, was 
the wickedness of the letter. Julia would have 
got over the other woman, but she would never 
get over his becoming a nobody. 

Lady Agnes challenged him upon this low 
prospect exactly as if he had embraced it with 
the malignant purpose of making Julia s return 
impossible. She contradicted her premises and 
lost her way in her wrath. What had made him 
suddenly turn round if he had been in good faith 
before ? He had never been in good faith 
never, never ; he had had from his earliest child 
hood the nastiest hankerings after a vulgar little 
daubing, trash-talking life ; they were not in him, 



 605 

the grander, nobler aspirations they never had 
been and he had been anything but honest to 
lead her on, to lead them all on, to think he 
would do something : the fall and the shame 
would have been less for them if they had come 
earlier. Moreover, what need under heaven had 
he to tell Charles Carteret of his cruel folly on 
his very death-bed ? as if he might n t have let 
it all alone and accepted the benefit the old man 
was so delighted to confer. No wonder the old 
man would keep his money for his heirs, if that 
was the way Nick proposed to repay him ; but 
where was the common sense, where was the 
common chanty, where was the common de 
cency, of tormenting him with such vile news in 
his last hours ? Was he trying what he could 
invent that would break her heart, that would 
send her in sorrow down to her grave ? Were n t 
they all miserable enough, and had n t he a ray 
of pity for his wretched sisters ? 

The relation of effect and cause, in regard to 
his sisters wretchedness, was but dimly discerni 
ble to Nick, who, however, easily perceived that 
his mother genuinely considered that his action 
had disconnected them all, still more than she 
held they were already disconnected, from the 
good things of life. Julia was money, Mr. Car 
teret was money, and everything else was pov 
erty. If these precious people had been prima 
rily money for Nick, it was after all a gracious 
tribute to his distributive power to have taken 



606  

for granted that for the rest of the family too the 
difference would have been so great. For days, 
for weeks and months afterward, the little room 
on the right of the hall seemed to our young man 
to vibrate, as if the very walls and window-panes 
still suffered, with the most disagreeable ordeal 
he had ever been through. 



XXXV. 

THAT evening the evening of his return 
from Beauclere Nick was conscious of a keen 
desire to get away, to go abroad, to leave behind 
him the little chatter his resignation would be 
sure to produce in an age of publicity which 
never discriminated as to the quality of events. 
Then he felt it was better to stay, to see the busi 
ness through on the spot. Besides, he would have 
to meet his constituents (would a parcel of cheese- 
eating burgesses ever have been " met " on so 
queer an occasion ?) and when that was over the 
worst would be over. Nick had an idea that he 
knew in advance how it would feel to be pointed 
at as a person who had given up a considerable 
chance of eventual "office" to take likenesses at 
so much a head. He would n t attempt, down at 
Harsh, to touch on the question of motive ; for, 
given the nature of the public mind of Harsh, 
that would be a strain on his faculty of expression. 
But as regards the chaff of the political world and 
of society, he had an idea he should find chaff 
enough for answers. It was true that when his 
mother " chaffed " him, in her own effective way, 
he had felt rather flattened out ; but then one s 
mother might have a heavier hand than any one 
else. 



6o8  

He had not thrown up the House of Commons 
to amuse himself ; he had thrown it up to work, 
to sit quietly down and bend over his task. If 
he should go abroad his mother might think he 
had some weak-minded view of joining Julia Dai- 
low and trying, with however little hope, to win 
her back an illusion it would be singularly per 
nicious to encourage. His desire for Julia s so 
ciety had succumbed, for the present at any rate, 
to an irresistible interruption he had become 
more and more conscious that they spoke a dif 
ferent language. Nick ftlt like a young man 
who has gone to the Rhineland to " get up " his 
German for an examination committed to talk, 
to read, to dream only in the new idiom. Now 
that he had taken his jump everything was sim 
plified, at the same time that everything was 
pitched in a higher, more excited key ; and he 
wondered how, in the absence of a common dia 
lect, he had conversed, on the whole so happily, 
with Julia. Then he had after-tastes of under 
standings tolerably independent of words. He 
was excited, because every fresh responsibility is 
exciting, and there was no manner of doubt that 
he had accepted one. No one knew what it was 
but himself (Gabriel Nash scarcely counted his 
whole attitude on the question of responsibility 
was so fantastic), and he would have to ask his 
dearest friends to take him on trust. Rather, he 
would ask nothing of any one, but would cultivate 
independence, mulishness and gayety and fix his 



 609 

thoughts on a bright if distant morrow. It was 
disagreeable to have to remember that his task 
would not be sweetened by a sense of heroism ; 
for if it might be heroic to give up the muses for 
the strife of great affairs, no romantic glamour 
worth speaking of would ever gather round an 
Englishman who, in the prime of his strength, 
had given up great, or even small, affairs for the 
muses. Such an original might himself, pri 
vately, perversely regard certain phases of this 
inferior commerce as a great affair ; but who 
would give him the benefit of that sort of confi 
dence except indeed a faithful, clever, excited 
little sister Biddy, if he should have the good 
luck to have one ? Biddy was in fact all ready 
for heroic flights and eager to think she might 
fight the battle of the beautiful by her brother s 
side ; so that Nick had really to moderate her and 
remind her that his actual job was not a crusade, 
with bugles and banners, but a gray, sedentary 
grind, whose charm was all at the core. You 
might have an emotion about it, and an emotion 
that would be a help, but this was not the sort of 
thing you could show the end in view would 
seem ridiculously small for it. Nick asked Biddy 
how one could talk to people about the " respon 
sibility" of what she would see him pottering at 
in his studio. 

Nick therefore did n t talk any more than he 
was forced to, having moreover a sense that that 
side of the situation would be plentifully looked 



6 10  

after by Gabriel Nash. He left the burden of 
explanation to others, meeting them on the 
ground of inexhaustible satire. He saw that he 
should live for months in a thick cloud of irony, 
not the finest air of the season, and he adopted 
the weapon to which a person whose use of to 
bacco is only occasional resorts when every one 
else produces a cigar he puffed the empirical, 
defensive cigarette. He accepted the idea of a 
mystery in his behavior, and abounded so in that 
sense that his critics were themselves bewildered. 
Some of them felt that they got, as the phrase is, 
little out of him he rose, in his good-humor, so 
much higher than the "rise" they had looked 
for on his very first encounter with the world 
after his scrimmage with his mother. He went 
to a dinner-party (he had accepted the invitation 
many days before), having seen his resignation, 
in the form of a telegram from Harsh, announced 
in the evening papers. The people he found 
there had seen it as well, and the most imagina 
tive of them wanted to know what he was going 
to do. Even the least imaginative asked if it 
were true he had changed his politics. He gave 
different answers to different persons, but left 
most of them under the impression that he had 
remarkable conscientious scruples. This, how 
ever, was not a formidable occasion, for there 
happened to be no one present he was particu 
larly fond of. There were old friends whom it 
would not be so easy to satisfy Nick was 



 6 1 1 

almost sorry, for an hour, that he had so many 
old friends. If he had had more enemies the case 
would have been simpler ; and he was fully aware 
that the hardest thing of all would be to be let 
off too easily. Then he would appear to himself 
to have been put on his generosity, and his de 
viation would wear its ugliest face. 

When he left the place at which he had been 
dining he betook himself to Rosedale Road : he 
saw no reason why he should go down to the 
House, though he knew he had not done with 
that yet. He had a dread of behaving as if he 
supposed he should be expected to make a fare 
well speech, and was thankful his eminence was 
not of a nature to create, on such an occasion, a 
demand for his oratory. He had, in fact, nothing 
whatever to say in public not a word, not a 
syllable. Though the hour was late he found 
Gabriel Nash established in his studio, drawn 
thither by the fine exhilaration of having seen an 
evening paper. Trying it late, on the chance, he 
had been told by Nick s servant that Nick would 
sleep there that night, and he had come in to 
wait, he was so eager to congratulate him. Nick 
submitted with a good grace to his society he 
was tired enough to go to bed, but he was rest 
less too in spite of feeling now, oddly enough, 
that Nash s congratulations could add little to his 
fortitude. He had felt a good deal, before, as if 
he were in Nash s hands ; but now that he had 
made his final choice he seemed to himself to be 



6l2  

altogether in his own. Gabriel was wonderful, 
but no Gabriel could assist him much henceforth. 

Gabriel was indeed more wonderful than ever, 
while he lolled on a divan and emitted a series of 
reflections which were even more ingenious than 
opportune. Nick walked up and down the room, 
and it might have been supposed from his manner 
that he was impatient for his visitor to withdraw. 
This idea would have been contradicted, however, 
by the fact that subsequently, after Nash had 
taken leave, he continued to perambulate. He 
had grown used to Nash had a sense that he 
had heard all he had to say. That was ore s pen 
alty with persons whose main gift was for talk, 
however irrigating ; talk engendered a sense of 
sameness much sooner than action. The things 
a man did were necessarily more different from 
each other than the things he said, even if he 
went in for surprising you. Nick felt Nash 
could never surprise him any more save by doing 
something. 

He talked of his host s future, he talked of Mir 
iam Rooth and of Peter Sherringham, whom he 
had seen at Miriam Rooth s and whom he de 
scribed as in a predicament delightful to behold. 
Nick asked a question or two about Peter s pre 
dicament, and learned, rather to his disappoint 
ment, that it consisted only of the fact that he 
was in love with Miriam. He requested his 
visitor to do better than this ; whereupon Nash 
added the touch that Sherringham would n t be 



 613 

able to have her. " Oh, they have ideas ! " he 
said, when Nick asked him why. 

" What ideas ? So has he, I suppose." 

" Yes, but they re not the same." 

"Oh well, they ll arrange something," said 
Nick. 

" You 11 have to help them a bit. She s in 
love with another man," Nash returned. 

" Do you mean with you ? " 

" Oh, I m never another man," said Nash ; 
"I m more the wrong one than the man himself. 
It s you she s after." And upon Nick s asking 
him what he meant by this he added: "While 
you were engaged in transferring her image to 
your sensorium, you stamped your own upon 
hers." 

Nick stopped in his walk, staring. " Ah, what 
a bore ! " 

" A bore ? Don t you think she s agreeable ? " 

Nick hesitated. " I wanted to go on with her 
now I can t." 

"My dear fellow, it only makes her hand 
somer : I wondered what was the matter with 
her." 

"Oh, that s twaddle," said Nick, turning away. 
" Besides, has she told you ? " 

" No, but her mother has." 

" Has she told her mother ? " 

"Mrs. Rooth says not. But I have known 
Mrs. Rooth to say that which is n t." 

" Apply that rule, then, to the information you 
speak of." 



614  

"Well, since you press me, I know more," said 
Nash. " Miriam knows you are engaged to a 
certain lady ; she told me as much, told me she 
had seen her here. That was enough to set Mir 
iam off she likes forbidden fruit." 

" I m not engaged to any lady. I was, but 
we ve altered our minds." 

" Ah, what a pity ! " sighed Nash. 

" Mephistopheles ! " Nick rejoined, stopping 
again and looking at his visitor gravely. 

" Pray, whom do you call Margaret ? May I 
ask if your failure of interest in the political situ 
ation is the cause of this change in your personal 
one ? " Nash went on. Nick signified to him 
that he might not ; whereupon Gabriel added : 
" I am not in the least devilish I only mean 
it s a pity you ve altered your minds, because 
now perhaps Miriam will alter hers. She goes 
from one thing to another. However, I won t 
tell her." 

" I will, then," said Nick, between jest and 
earnest. 

" Would that really be prudent ? " Nash asked, 
with an intonation that made hilarity prevail. 

" At any rate," Nick resumed, " nothing would 
induce me to interfere with Peter Sherringham. 
That sounds fatuous, but to you I don t mind 
appearing an ass." 

" The thing would be to get Sherringham 
out of spite to entangle himself with another 
woman." 



 615 

" What good would that do ? " 

" Oh, Miriam would begin to fancy him then." 

" Spite surely is n t a conceivable motive for 
a healthy man." 

" Ah, Sherringham is n t a healthy man. He s 
too much in love." 

"Then he won t care for another woman." 

" He would try to, and that would produce its 
effect its effect on Miriam." 

" You talk like an American novel. Let him 
try, and God keep us all straight." Nick thought, 
in extreme silence, of his poor little Biddy and 
hoped he would have to see to it a little that 
Peter would n t " try " on her. He changed the 
subject and, before Nash went away, took occa 
sion to remark to him the occasion was offered 
by some new allusion of the visitor s to the sport 
he hoped to extract from seeing Nick carry out 
everything to which he stood committed that 
the great comedy would fall very flat, the great 
incident would pass unnoticed. 

" Oh, if you 11 simply do your part I 11 take 
care of the rest," said Nash. 

" If you mean by doing my part working like a 
beaver, it s all right," Nick replied. 

" Ah, you reprobate, you 11 become a fashion 
able painter, a P. R. A. ! " his companion groaned, 
getting up to go. 

When he had gone Nick threw himself back 
on the cushions of the divan and, with his hands 
locked above his head, sat a long time lost in 



6l6  

thought. He had sent his servant to bed ; he 
was unmolested. He gazed before him into the 
gloom produced by the unheeded burning out of 
the last candle. The vague outer light came in 
through the tall studio window, and the painted 
images, ranged about, looked confused in the 
dusk. If his mother had seen him she might 
have thought he was staring at his father s ghost. 



XXXVI. 

THE night Peter Sherringham walked away 
from Balaklava Place with Gabriel Nash, the talk 
of the two men directed itself, as was natural 
under the circumstances, to the question of Mir 
iam s future renown and the pace, as Nash called 
it, at which she would go. Critical spirits as they 
both were, and one of them as dissimulative in 
passion as the other was paradoxical in the ab 
sence of it, they yet took this renown for granted 
as completely as the simple-minded, a pair of hot 
spectators in the pit, might have done, and ex 
changed observations on the assumption that the 
only uncertain element would be the pace. This 
was a proof of general subjugation. Peter wished 
not to show, but he wished to know ; and in the 
restlessness of his anxiety he was ready even to 
risk exposure, great as the sacrifice might be of 
the imperturbable, urbane skepticism most ap 
propriate to a secretary of embassy. He was 
unable to rid himself of the sense that Gabriel 
Nash had got up earlier than he, had had oppor 
tunities in days already distant, the days of Mrs. 
Rooth s hungry foreign rambles. Something of 
authority and privilege stuck to him from this, 
and it made Sherringham still more uncomfort- 



6l8  

able when he was most conscious that, at the 
best, even the trained diplomatic mind would 
never get a grasp of Miriam as a whole. She 
was constructed to revolve like the terrestrial 
globe ; some part or other of her was always out 
of sight or in shadow. 

Sherringham talked to conceal his feelings, 
and, like every man doing a thing from that sort 
of intention, did it perhaps too much. They 
agreed that, putting strange accidents aside, Mir 
iam would go further than any one had gone, in 
England at least, and within the memory of man ; 
and that it was a pity, as regards marking the 
comparison, that for so long no one had gone any 
distance worth speaking of. They further agreed 
that it would naturally seem absurd to any one 
who did n t know, their prophesying such big 
things on such small evidence ; and they agreed 
lastly that the absurdity quite vanished as soon 
as the prophets knew as they knew. Their know 
ledge (they quite recognized this) was simply 
confidence raised to a high point the com 
munication of the girl s own confidence. The 
conditions were enormously to make, but it was 
of the very essence of Miriam s confidence that 
she would make them. The parts, the plays, the 
theatres, the " support," the audiences, the crit 
ics, the money were all to be found, but she cast 
a spell which prevented that from seeming a 
serious hitch. One might not see from one day 
to the other what she would do or how she would 



 619 

do it, but she would none the less go on. She 
would have to construct her own road, as it were, 
but at the worst there would only be delays in 
making it. These delays would depend on the 
hardness of the stones she had to break. 

As Sherringham had perceived, you never 
knew where to " have " Gabriel Nash ; a truth 
exemplified in his unexpected delight at the pros 
pect of Miriam s drawing forth the modernness 
of the age. You might have thought he would 
loathe that modernness ; but he had a brilliant, 
amused, amusing vision of it saw it as some 
thing huge and fantastically vulgar. Its vulgar 
ity would rise to the grand style, like that of a 
London railway station, and Miriam s publicity 
would be as big as the globe itself. All the ma 
chinery was ready, the platform laid ; the facili 
ties, the wires and bells and trumpets, the co 
lossal, deafening newspaperism of the period 
its most distinctive sign were waiting for her, 
their predestined mistress, to press her foot on 
the spring and set them all in motion. Gabriel 
brushed in a large bright picture of her progress 
through the time and round the world, round it 
and round it again, from continent to continent 
and clime to clime ; with populations and deputa 
tions, reporters and photographers, placards and 
interviews and banquets, steamers, railways, dol 
lars, diamonds, speeches and artistic ruin all 
jumbled into her train. Regardless of expense 
the spectacle would be and thrilling, though 



620  

somewhat monotonous the drama a drama 
more bustling than any she would put on the 
stage and a spectacle that would beat everything 
for scenery. In the end her divine voice would 
crack, screaming to foreign ears and antipodal 
barbarians, and her clever manner would lose all 
quality, simplified to a few unmistakable knock 
down dodges. Then she would be at the fine 
climax of life and glory, still young and insa 
tiate, but already coarse, hard and raddled, with 
nothing left to do and nothing left to do it with, 
the remaining years all before her and the raison 
d etre all behind. It would be curious and mag 
nificent and grotesque. 

" Oh, she 11 have some good years they 11 
be worth having," Sherringham insisted, as they 
went. " Besides, you see her too much as a 
humbug and too little as a real producer. She 
has ideas great ones; she loves the thing for 
itself. That may keep a woman serious/ 

"Her greatest idea must always be to show 
herself; and fortunately she has a splendid self 
to show. I think of her absolutely as a real pro 
ducer, but as a producer whose production is her 
own person. No person, even as fine a one as 
hers, will stand that for more than an hour, so 
that humbuggery has very soon to lend a hand. 
However," Nash continued, " if she s a fine hum 
bug it will do as well, and perfectly suit the time. 
We can all be saved by vulgarity ; that s the sol 
vent of all difficulties and the blessing of this 



 621 

delightful age. Let no man despair ; a new hope 
has dawned." 

" She 11 do her work like any other worker, 
with the advantage over many that her talent is 
rare," Peter replied. " Compared with the life of 
many women, that s security and sanity of the 
highest order. Then she can t help her beauty. 
You can t vulgarize that." 

" Oh, can t you ? " exclaimed Gabriel Nash. 

"It will abide with her till the day of her 
death. It is n t a mere superficial freshness. 
She s very noble." 

" Yes, that s the pity of it," said Nash. " She s 
a capital girl, and I quite admit that she 11 do, 
for a while, a lot of good. She will have bright 
ened up the world for a great many people ; she 
will have brought the ideal nearer to them, held 
it fast, for an hour, with its feet on earth and its 
great wings trembling. That s always something, 
for blessed is he who has dropped even the small 
est coin into the little iron box that contains the 
precious savings of mankind. Miriam will doubt 
less have dropped a big gold piece. It will be 
found, in the general scramble, on the day the 
race goes bankrupt. And then, for herself, she 
will have had a great go at life." 

" Oh, yes, she 11 have got out of her hole ; she 
won t have vegetated," said Sherringham. " That 
makes her touching to me ; it adds to the many 
good reasons for which one may want to help 
her. She s tackling a big job, and tackling it by 



622  

herself ; throwing herself upon the world, in good 
faith, and dealing with it as she can ; meeting 
alone, in her youth, her beauty, her generosity, 
all the embarrassments of notoriety and all the 
difficulties of a profession of which, if one half is 
what s called brilliant, the other half is odious." 

" She has great courage, but should you speak 
of her as solitary, with such a lot of us all round 
her ? " Gabriel asked. 

" She s a great thing for you and me, but we re 
a small thing for her." 

" Well, a good many small things may make up 
a considerable one," Nash returned. " There must 
always be the man ; he s the indispensable ele 
ment in such a life, and he 11 be the last thing 
she 11 ever want for." 

" What man are you talking about ? " Sherring- 
ham asked, rather confusedly. 

" The man of the hour, whoever he is. She 11 
inspire innumerable devotions." 

" Of course she will, and they will be precisely 
a part of the insufferable side of her life." 

" Insufferable to whom ? " Nash inquired. 
" Don t forget that the insufferable side of her 
life will be just the side she 11 thrive on. You 
can t eat your cake and have it, and you can t 
make omelettes without breaking eggs. You 
can t at once sit by the fire and fly about the 
world, and you can t go round and round the 
globe without having adventures. You can t be 
a great actress without quivering nerves. If you 



, 623 

haven t them you will only be a small one. If 
you have them, your friends will be pretty sure 
to hear of them. Your nerves and your adven 
tures, your eggs and your cake, are part of the 
cost of the most expensive of professions. If you 
do your business at all you should do it hand 
somely, so that the costs may run up tremen 
dously. You play with human passions, with ex 
altations and ecstasies and terrors, and if you 
trade on the fury of the elements you must know 
how to ride the storm." 

" Those are the fine old commonplaces about 
the artistic temperament, but I usually find the 
artist a very meek, decent little person," said 
Sherringham. 

"You never find the artist you only find his 
work, and that s all you need to find. When the 
artist s a woman, and the woman s an actress, 
meekness and decency will doubtless be there in 
the right proportions," Nash went on. " Miriam 
will represent them for you, if you give her her 
starting-point, with the utmost charm." 

"Of course she 11 have devotions that s all 
right," said Sherringham, impatiently. 

"And don t you see? they ll mitigate 
her solitude, they 11 even enliven it," Nash re 
marked. 

" She 11 probably box a good many ears : that 11 
be lively," Peter rejoined, with some grim ness. 

" Oh, magnificent ! it will be a merry life. 
Yet with its tragic passages, its distracted or its 



624  

pathetic hours," Nash continued. " In short, a 
little of everything." 

The two men walked on without further speech, 
till at last Sherringham said : " The best thing 
for a woman in her situation is to marry some 
good fellow." 

" Oh, I dare say she 11 do that too ! " Nash 
laughed ; a remark in .consequence of which 
Peter again lapsed into silence. Gabriel left him 
to enjoy his silence for some minutes ; after 
which he added : " There s a good fellow she d 
marry to-morrow." 

Peter hesitated. " Do you mean her friend 
Dashwood ? " 

" No, no, I mean Nick Dormer." 

" She d marry him ? " Sherringham asked. 

" I mean her head s full of him. But she 11 
hardly get the chance." 

" Does she like him so much as that ? " Sher 
ringham went on. 

" I don t know quite how much you mean, but 
enough for all practical ends." 

" Marrying a fashionable actress that s 
hardly a practical end." 

" Certainly not, but I m not speaking from 
his point of view. Moreover, I thought you just 
now said it would be such a good thing for her." 

"To marry Nick Dormer ?" 

" You said a good fellow, and he s the very 
best." 

" I was n t thinking of the man, but of the 



 62$ 

marriage. It would protect her, make things 
safe and comfortable for her and keep a lot of 
cads and blackguards away." 

"She ought to marry the prompter or the box- 
keeper," said Nash. " Then it would be all 
right. I think indeed they generally do, don t 
they ? " 

Sherringham felt for a moment a strong dispo 
sition to drop .his companion on the spot to 
cross to the other side of the street and walk 
away without him. But there was a different 
impulse which struggled with this one and, after 
a minute, overcame it the impulse which led 
to his saying presently : " Has she told you that 
that she s in love with Nick ? " 

"No, no that s not the way I know it." 

" Has Nick told you, then ? " 

"On the contrary, I ve told him." 

" You have rendered him a questionable ser 
vice if you have no proof," said Peter. 

" My proof is only that I ve seen her with 
him. She s charming, poor thing." 

" But surely she is n t in love with every man 
she s charming to." 

" I mean she s charming to me," Nash replied. 
"I see her that way. But judge for yourself 
the first time you get a chance." 

" When shall I get a chance ? Nick does n t 
come near her." 

" Oh, he 11 come, he 11 come ; his picture 
is n t finished." 



626  

" You mean he 11 be the box-keeper, then ? " 
" My dear fellow, I shall never allow it," said 
Gabriel Nash. " It would be idiotic and quite un 
necessary. He s beautifully arranged, in quite a 
different line. Fancy his taking that sort of job 
on his hands ! Besides, she would never expect 
it ; she s not such a goose. They re very good 
friends it will go on that way. She s an ex 
cellent sort of woman, for him to know; she ll 
give him lots of ideas of the plastic kind. He 
would have been up there before this, but he has 
been absorbed in this delightful squabble with 
his constituents. That, of course, is pure amuse 
ment ; but when once it s well launched he ll 
get back to business, and his business will be a 
very different matter from Miriam s. Imagine 
him writing her advertisements, living on her 
money, adding up her profits, having rows and 
recriminations with her agent, carrying her 
shawl, spending his days in her rouge-pot. The 
right man for that, if she must have one, will 
turn up. Pour le mariage, non. Miriam is n t 
an idiot ; she really, for a woman, quite sees 
things as they are." 

As Sherringham had not crossed the street 
and left Gabriel planted, he was obliged to brave 
the torment of this suggestive flow. But descry 
ing, in the dusky vista of the Edgware Road, a 
vague and vigilant hansom, he waved his stick 
with eagerness and with the abrupt declaration 
that he was tired, must drive the rest of the way. 



 627 

He offered Nash, as he entered the vehicle, no 
seat, but this coldness was not reflected in the 
lucidity with which that master of every subject 
went on to affirm that there was, of course, a 
danger, the danger that, in given circumstances, 
Miriam would leave the stage. 

" Leave it, you mean, for some man ? " 

" For the man we re talking about." 

" For Nick Dormer ? " Peter asked, from his 
place in the cab, his paleness lighted by its 
lamps. 

" If he should make it a condition. But why 
should he why should he make any conditions ? 
He s not an ass, either. You see it would be a 
bore," Nash continued, while the hansom waited, 
" because if she were to do anything of that sort 
she would make him pay for the sacrifice." 

" Oh, yes, she d make him pay for the sacri 
fice," Sherringham repeated. 

" And then, when he had paid, she d go back 
to her footlights," Gabriel added, explicatively, 
from the curbstone, as Sherringham closed the 
apron of the cab. 

"I see she d go back good-night," Peter 
replied. "Please go on ! " he cried to the driver 
through the hole in the roof. And when the ve 
hicle rolled away, he subjoined, to himself, " Of 
course she would and quite right ! " 



XXXVII. 

" JUDGE for yourself when you get a chance," 
Nash had said ; and as it turned out Sherringham 
was able to judge two days later, for he found 
his cousin in Balaklava Place on the Tuesday fol 
lowing his walk with Gabriel. He had not only 
stayed away from the theatre on the Monday 
evening (he regarded this as an achievement of 
some importance), but had not been near Miriam 
during the day. He had meant to absent himself 
from her company on Tuesday as well ; a deter 
mination confirmed by the fact that the afternoon 
turned out wet. But when, at ten minutes to 
five o clock, he jumped into a hansom and di 
rected its course to St. John s Wood, it was pre 
cisely upon the weather that he shifted the re 
sponsibility of his behavior. 

Miriam had dined when he reached the villa, 
but she was lying down she was tired before 
going to the theatre. Mrs. Rooth was, however, 
in the drawing-room with three gentlemen, in 
two of whom the fourth visitor was not startled 
to recognize Basil Dashwood and Gabriel Nash. 
Dashwood appeared to have become Miriam s 
brother-in-arms and a second child a fonder 
one to Mrs. Rooth ; it had come to Sherring- 



 629 

ham s knowledge the last time he was in Bala- 
klava Place that the young actor had finally 
moved his lodgings into the quarter, making 
himself a near neighbor for all sorts of conven 
ience. " Hang his convenience ! " Peter thought, 
perceiving that Mrs. Lovick s "Arty " was now 
altogether one of the family. Oh, the family 
it was a queer one to be connected with ; that 
consciousness was acute in Sherringham s breast 
to-day as he entered Mrs. Rooth s little circle. 
The room was filled with cigarette-smoke and 
there was a messy coffee-service on the piano, 
whose keys Basil Dashwood lightly touched for 
his own diversion. Nash, addressing the room, 
of course, was at one end of a little sofa, with his 
nose in the air, and Nick Dormer was at the 
other end, seated much at his ease, with a cer 
tain privileged appearance of having been there 
often before, though Sherringham knew he had 
not. He looked uncritical and very young, as 
rosy as a school-boy on a half holiday. It was 
past five o clock in the day, but Mrs. Rooth was 
not dressed ; there was, however, no want of fin 
ish in her elegant attitude the same relaxed 
grandeur (she seemed to let you understand) for 
which she used to be distinguished at Castle 
Nugent when the house was full. She toyed 
incongruously, in her unbuttoned wrapper, with 
a large tinsel fan which resembled a theatrical 
property. 

It was one of the discomforts of Sherring- 






630  

ham s situation that many of those minor mat 
ters which are, superficially at least, most char 
acteristic of the histrionic life had power to dis 
please him, so that he was obliged to make the 
effort of indulgence. He disliked besmoked 
drawing-rooms and irregular meals and untidy 
arrangements ; he could suffer from the vulgarity 
of Mrs. Rooth s apartments, the importunate 
photographs (they gave on his nerves), the bar 
barous absence of signs of an orderly domestic 
life, the odd volumes from the circulating library 
(you could see what they were the very covers 
told you at a glance) tumbled about with cups 
or glasses on them. He had not waited till now 
to make the reflection that it was a strange thing 
fate should have goaded him into that sort of 
contact ; but, as he stood before Mrs. Rooth and 
her companions, he made it, perhaps, more point 
edly than ever. Her companions, somehow, who 
were not responsible, did n t keep him from mak 
ing it ; which was particularly odd, as they were 
not, superficially, in the least of Bohemian type. 
Almost the first thing that struck him, as it hap 
pened, in coming into the room, was the essential 
good looks of his cousin, who was a gentleman 
to the eye in a different degree from the high- 
collared Dashwood. Peter did n t hate him for 
being such a pleasant young Englishman ; his 
consciousness was traversed rather by a fresh 
wave of annoyance at Julia s failure to get on 
with him on that substantial basis. 



 63! 

It was Sherringham s first encounter with Nick 
since his arrival in London : they had been, on 
one side and the other, so much taken up with 
their own affairs. Since their last meeting Nick 
had, as we know, to his kinsman s perception, 
really taken on a new character : he had done a 
fine stroke of business in a quiet way. This 
made him a figure to be counted wiA, and in just 
the sense in which Peter desired least to count 
with him. Poor Sherringham, after his somer 
sault in the blue, was much troubled these last 
days ; he was ravaged by contending passions ; 
he paid, every hour, in a torment of unrest, for 
what was false in his position, the impossibility 
of being consistent, the opposition of interest and 
desire. Nick, his junior and a lighter weight, had 
settled his problem and showed no wounds ; there 
was something impertinent and mystifying in it. 
He looked too innocently young and happy there, 
and too careless and modest and amateurish for 
a rival or for the genius that he was apparently 
going to try to be the genius that, the other 
day, in the studio with Biddy, Peter had got a 
startled glimpse of his capacity for being. Sher 
ringham would have liked to feel that he had 
grounds of resentment, that Julia had been badly 
treated or that Nick was fatuous, for in that case 
he might have regarded him as offensive. But 
where was the offense of his merely being liked 
by a woman in respect to whom Peter had defi 
nitely denied himself the luxury of pretensions, 



632  

especially if the offender had taken no action in 
the matter ? It could scarcely be called culpable 
action to call, casually, on an afternoon when the 
lady was invisible. Peter, at any rate, was dis 
tinctly glad Miriam was invisible ; and he pro 
posed to himself to suggest to Nick after a little 
that they should adjourn together they had 
such intere^ing things to talk about. Mean 
while, Nick greeted him with candid tones and 
pleasant eyes, in which he could read neither con 
fusion nor defiance. Sherringham was reassured 
against a danger he believed he didn t recognize 
and puzzled by a mystery he flattered himself he 
did n t mind. And he was still more ashamed of 
being reassured than of being puzzled. 

It must be recorded that Miriam remained in 
visible only a few minutes longer. Nick, as Sher 
ringham gathered, had been about a quarter of 
an hour in the house, which would have given 
the girl, aroused from her repose, about time to 
array herself to come down to him. At all events 
she was in the room, prepared, apparently, to go 
to the theatre, very shortly after Sherringham 
had become sensible of how glad he was she was 
out of it. Familiarity had never yet cured him 
of a certain tremor of expectation, and even of 
suspense, in regard to her entrances ; a flutter 
caused by the simple circumstance of her infinite 
variety. To say she was always acting suggests 
too much that she was often fatiguing ; for her 
changing face affected this particular admirer, at 



 633 

least, not as a series of masks, but as a response 
to perceived differences, an intensity of sensi 
bility, or still more as something cleverly con 
structive, like the shifting of the scene in a play 
or a room with many windows. Her incarna 
tions were incalculable, but if her present denied 
her past and declined responsibility for her fu 
ture, it made a good thing of the hour and kept 
the actual very actual. This time the actual was 
a bright, gentle, graceful, smiling young woman 
in a new dress, eager to go out, drawing on fresh 
gloves, who looked as if she were about to step 
into a carriage and (it was Gabriel Nash who 
thus formulated her physiognomy) do a lot of 
London things. 

The young woman had time to spare, however, 
and she sat down and talked and laughed, and 
presently gave, as it seemed to Sherringham, a 
finer character to the tawdry little room. It was 
honorable enough if it belonged to her. She de 
scribed herself as in a state of nervous bewilder 
ment exhausted, stupefied, blinded, with the 
rehearsals of the forthcoming piece (the first 
night was close at hand, and it was , going to be 
d ttn mauvais they would all see !), but there 
was no correspondence between this account of 
the matter and her present kindly gayety. She 
sent her mother away to "put on some clothes 
or something " and, left alone with the visitors, 
went to a long glass between the windows, talk 
ing always to Nick Dormer, and revised and re- 



634  

arranged, a little, her own attire. She talked to 
Nick, over her shoulder, and to Nick only, as if 
he were the guest to recognize and the others 
did n t count. She broke out, immediately, about 
his having thrown up his seat, wished to know if 
the strange story told her by Mr. Nash were true 
that he had knocked all the hopes of his party 
into pie. 

Nick took it in this way and gave a jocular 
picture of his party s ruin, the critical condition 
of public affairs : evidently as yet he remained 
inaccessible to shame or repentance. Sherring- 
ham, before Miriam s entrance, had not, in shak. 
ing hands with Nick, made even a roundabout 
allusion to his odd " game ; " there seemed a sort 
of muddled good taste in being silent about it. 
He winced a little on seeing how his scruples had 
been wasted, and was struck with the fine, jocose^ 
direct turn of his kinsman s conversation with the 
young actress. It was a part of her unexpected 
ness that she took the heavy literal view of Nick s 
behavior ; declared frankly, though without ill- 
nature, that she had no patience with his folly. 
She was horribly disappointed she had set her 
heart on his being a great statesman, one of the 
rulers of the people and the glories of England. 
What was so useful, what was so noble ? how 
it belittled everything else ! She had expected 
him to wear a cordon and a star some day (and to 
get them very soon), and to come and see her in 
her loge ; it would look so well. She talked like 



 635 

a lovely Philistine, except, perhaps, when she ex 
pressed surprise at hearing she heard it from 
Gabriel Nash that in England gentlemen ac 
coutred with those emblems of their sovereign s 
esteem did n t so far forget themselves as to stray 
into the dressing-rooms of actresses. She ad 
mitted, after a moment, that they were quite 
right the dressing-rooms of actresses were 
nasty places ; but she was sorry, for that was the 
sort of thing she had always figured, in a corner 
a distinguished man, slightly bald, in evening 
dress, with orders, admiring the smallness of a 
satin shoe and saying witty things. Gabriel Nash 
was convulsed with hilarity at this such a vi 
sion of the British political hero. Coming back 
from the glass and making him give her his 
place on the sofa, she seated herself near Nick 
and continued to express her regret at his per 
versity. 

"They all say that all the charming women, 
but I should n t have looked for it from you," 
Nick replied. " I ve given you such an example 
of what I can do in another line." 

" Do you mean my portrait ? Oh, I ve got it, 
with your name and M. P. in the corner, and 
that s precisely why I m content. M. P. in 
the corner of a picture is delightful, but I want 
to break the mould : I don t in the least insist 
on your giving specimens to others. And the 
artistic life, when you can lead another if you 
have any alternative, however modest is a very 



636  

poor business. It comes last, in dignity after 
everything else. Ain t I up to my eyes in it, and 
don t I know ? " 

"You talk like my broken-hearted mother," 
said Nick. 

" Does she hate it so intensely ?" 

" She has the darkest ideas about it the wild 
est theories. I can t imagine where she gets 
them ; partly, I think, from a general convic 
tion that the aesthetic a horrible insidious 
foreign disease is eating the healthy core out 
of English life (dear old English life !), and partly 
from the charming drawings in Punch and the 
clever satirical articles, pointing at mysterious 
depths of contamination, in the other weekly 
papers. She believes there s a dreadful coterie of 
uncannily clever and desperately refined people, 
who wear a kind of loose, faded uniform and wor 
ship only beauty which is a fearful thing that 
Nash has introduced me to it, that I now spend 
all my time in it, and that, for its sweet sake, I 
have repudiated the most sacred engagements. 
Poor Nash, who, so far as I can make out, isn t 
in any sort of society, however bad ! " 

"But I m uncannily clever," Nash interposed, 
" and though I can t afford the uniform (I be 
lieve you get it best somewhere in South Audley 
Street), I do worship beauty. I really think it s 
I the weekly papers mean." 

" Oh, I ve read the articles - - I know the 
sort ! " said Basil Dashwood. 



 637 

Miriam looked at him. " Go and see if the 
brougham s there I ordered it early." 

Dashwood, without moving, consulted his watch. 
"It isn t time yet I know more about the 
brougham than you. I ve made a rattling good 
arrangement for her it really costs her no 
thing," the young actor continued confidentially 
to Sherringham, near whom he had placed him 
self. 

" Your mother s quite right to be broken 
hearted," Miriam declared, "and I can imagine 
exactly what she has been through. I should 
like to talk with her I should like to see her." 
Nick broke into ringing laughter, reminding her 
that she had talked to him, while she sat for her 
portrait, in directly the opposite sense, most sug 
gestively and inspiringly ; and Nash explained 
that she was studying the part of a political 
duchess and wished to take observations for it, 
to work herself into the character. Miriam might 
in fact have been a political duchess, as she sat 
with her head erect and her gloved hands folded, 
smiling with aristocratic dimness at Nick. She 
shook her head with stately sadness ; she might 
have been representing Mary Stuart in Schiller s 
play. " I ve changed since that. I want you to 
be the grandest thing there is the counselor of 
kings." 

Peter Sherringham wondered if possibly it were 
not since she had met his sister in Nick s studio 
that she had changed, if perhaps it had not oc- 



638  

curred to her that it would give Julia the sense 
of being more effectually routed to know that 
the woman who had thrown the bomb was one 
who also tried to keep Nick in the straight path. 
This indeed would involve an assumption that 
Julia might know, whereas it was perfectly pos 
sible that she mightn t and more than possible 
that if she should she would n t care. Miriam s 
essential fondness for trying different ways was 
always there as an adequate reason for any par. 
ticular way ; a truth which, however, sometimes 
only half prevented the particular way from being 
vexatious to Sherringham. 

" Yet, after all, who is more aesthetic than you, 
and who goes in more for the beautiful ? " Nick 
asked. " You re never so beautiful as when you 
pitch into it." 

" Oh, I m an inferior creature, of an inferior 
sex, and I have to earn my bread as I can. I d 
give it all up in a moment, my odious trade 
for an inducement." 

" And pray what do you mean by an induce 
ment?" Nick demanded. 

" My dear fellow, she means you if you 11 
give her a permanent engagement to sit for 
you ! " exclaimed Gabriel Nash. " What singu 
larly crude questions you ask ! " 

" I like the way she talks," Basil Dashwood 
broke in, " when I gave up the most brilliant 
prospects, of very much the same kind as Mr. 
Dormer s, expressly to go on the stage." 



 639 

" You re an inferior creature too," said Mir 
iam. 

" Miss Rooth is very hard to satisfy," Sherring- 
ham observed. " A man of distinction, slightly 
bald, in evening dress, with orders, in the corner 
of her loge she has such a personage ready 
made to her hand, and she does n t so much as 
look at him. Am I not an inducement ? Have 
I not offered you a permanent engagement ? " 

" Your orders where are your orders ? " Mir 
iam inquired, with a sweet smile, getting up. 

"I shall be a minister next year, and an am 
bassador before you know it. Then I shall stick 
on everything that can be had." 

" And they call us mountebanks ! " cried the 
girl. " I ve been so glad to see you again do 
you want another sitting ? " she went on, to Nick, 
as if to take leave of him. 

"As many as you ll give me I shall be 
grateful for all," Nick answered. " I should like 
to do you as you are at present. You re totally 
different from the woman I painted you re 
wonderful." 

" The Comic Muse ! " laughed Miriam. " Well, 
you must wait till our first nights are over 
I m sur les dents till then. There s everything 
to do, and I have to do it all. That fellow s good 
for nothing for nothing but domestic life," and 
she glanced at Basil Dashwood. " He has n t 
an idea not one that you d willingly tell of 
him, though he s rather useful for the stables. 



640  

We ve got stables now or we try to look as if 
we had : Dash wood s ideas are de cette force. In 
ten days I shall have more time." 

"The Comic Muse? Never, never," Sherring- 
ham protested. " You are not to go smirking 
through the age and down to posterity I d 
rather see you as Medusa crowned with serpents. 
That s what you look like when you look best." 

"That s consoling when I ve just bought a 
new bonnet ! I forgot to tell you just now that 
when you are an ambassador you may propose 
anything you like," Miriam went on. " But ex 
cuse me if I make that condition. Seriously 
speaking, come to me glittering with orders and 
I shall probably succumb. I can t resist stars 
and garters. Only you must, as you say, have 
them all. I doiit like to hear Mr. Dormer talk 
the slang of the studio like that phrase just 
now : it is a fall to a lower state. However, when 
one is low one must crawl, and I m crawling 
down to the Strand. Dash wood, see if mamma s 
ready. If she isn t, I decline to wait ; you must 
bring her in a hansom. I 11 take Mr. Dormer in 
the brougham ; I want to talk with Mr. Dormer ; 
he must drive with me to the theatre. His situ 
ation is full of interest." Miriam led the way out 
of the room as she continued to chatter, and 
when she reached the house-door, with the four 
men in her train, the carriage had just drawn 
up at the garden-gate. It appeared that Mrs. 
Rooth was not ready, and the girl, in spite of a 



 64! 

remonstrance from Nick, who had the sense of 
usurping the old lady s place, repeated her injunc 
tion that she should be brought on in a cab. Mir 
iam s companions accompanied her to the gate, 
and she insisted upon Nick s taking his seat in 
the brougham and taking it first. Before she 
entered she put out her hand to Sherringham, 
and, looking up at him, held his own kindly. 
" Dear old master, are n t you coming to-night ? 
I miss you when you are not there." 

"Don t go don t go it s too much," Nash 
interposed. 

" She is wonderful," said Basil Dashwood, re 
garding her admiringly ; " she has gone into the 
rehearsals, tooth and nail. But nothing takes it 
out of her." 

" Nothing puts it into you, my dear ! " Miriam 
returned. Then she went on, to Sherringham : 
"You re the faithful one you re the one I 
count on." He -was not looking at her ; his eyes 
traveled into the carriage, where they rested on 
Nick Dormer, established on the further seat 
with his face turned toward the further window. 
He was the one, faithful or no, counted on or no, 
whom a charming woman had preferred to carry 
off, and there was a certain triumph for him in 
that fact ; but it pleased Sherringham to imagine 
that his attitude was a little foolish. Miriam 
discovered something of this sort in Sherring- 
ham s eyes ; for she exclaimed abruptly : " Don t 
kill him he does n t care for me ! " With 



642  

this she passed into the carriage, which rolled 
away. 

Sherringham stood watching it a moment, till 
he heard Basil Dashwood again beside him. 
" You would n t believe what I make him do it 
for a little fellow I know." 

" Good-by ; take good care of Mrs. Rooth," 
said Gabriel Nash, waving a cheerful farewell to 
the young actor. He gave a smiling survey of 
the heavens and remarked to Sherringham that 
the rain had stopped. Was he walking, was he 
driving, should they be going in the same di 
rection ? Sherringham cared little about his 
direction and had little account of it to give ; he 
simply moved away in silence, with Gabriel at 
his side. Gabriel was partly an affliction to him ; 
indeed, the fact that he had assumed a baleful 
fascination made him only a deeper affliction. 
Sherringham moreover did him the justice to ob 
serve that he could hold his peace occasionally : 
he had, for instance, this afternoon, taken little 
part in the conversation in Balaklava Place. 
Peter greatly disliked to talk to him of Miriam, 
but he liked Nash to talk of her, and he even 
liked him to say such things as he might contra 
dict. He was not, however, moved to contradict 
an assertion dropped by his companion, discon 
nectedly, at the end of a few minutes, to the ef 
fect that she was after all the most good-natured 
creature alive. All the same, Nash added, it 
would n t do for her to take possession of an 



 643 

organization like Nick s; and he repeated that, for 
his part, he would never allow it. It would be 
on his conscience to interfere. To which Sher- 
ringham replied, disingenuously, that they might 
all do as they liked it didn t matter a button 
to him. And with an effort to carry off that 
comedy, he changed the subject. 



XXXVIII. 

PETER SHERRINGHAM would not for a moment 
have admitted that he was jealous of Nick Dor 
mer, but he would almost have liked to be 
accused of it ; for this would have given him an 
opportunity to declare, with plausibility, that so 
uncomfortable a passion had no application to his 
case. How could a man be jealous when he was 
not a suitor ? how could he pretend to guard a 
property which was neither his own nor destined 
to become his own ? There could be no question 
of loss when one had nothing at stake, and no 
question of envy when the responsibility of pos 
session was exactly what one prayed to be deliv 
ered from. The measure of one s susceptibility 
was one s pretensions, and Peter was not only 
ready to declare over and over again that, thank 
God, he had none : his spiritual detachment was 
still more complete he literally suffered from 
the fact that the declaration was but little elicited. 
He connected an idea of virtue and honor with 
his attitude ; for surely it was a high example of 
conduct to have quenched a personal passion for 
the sake of the public service. He had gone over 
the whole question at odd, irrepressible hours ; 
he had returned, spiritually speaking, the buffet 



 64$ 

administered to him, in a moment, that day in 
Rosedale Road, by the spectacle of the crdnerie 
with which Nick could let worldly glories slide. 
Resolution for resolution, he preferred after all 
another sort, and his own crdnerie would be 
shown in the way he should stick to his profes 
sion and stand up for British interests. If Nick 
had leaped over a wall he would leap over a river. 
The course of his river was already traced and 
his loins were already girded. Thus he was jus 
tified in holding that the measure of a man s sus 
ceptibility was a man s attitude : that was the 
only thing he was bound to give an account of. 

He was perpetually giving an account of it to 
his own soul, in default of other listeners. He 
was quite angry at having tasted a sweetness in 
Miriam s assurance, at the carriage door, bestowed 
indeed with very little solemnity, that Nick 
did n t care for her. Wherein did it concern him 
that Nick cared for her or that Nick did n t ? 
Wherein did it signify to him that Gabriel Nash 
should have taken upon himself to disapprove of 
a union between the young actress and the young 
painter and to frustrate an accident that might 
perhaps be happy ? For those had also been 
cooling words, at the hour, though Peter blushed 
on the morrow to think that he had perceived in 
them anything but Nash s personal sublimity. 
He was ashamed of having been refreshed, and 
refreshed by so sickly a draught, because it was 
his theory that he was not in a fever. As for 



646 , 

keeping an eye on Nick, it would soon become 
clear to that young man and that young man s 
charming friend that he had quite other uses for 
his sharpness. Nick and Miriam and Gabriel 
Nash could straighten out their complications ac 
cording to their light. He would never speak to 
Nick of Miriam ; he felt, indeed, just now as if 
he should never speak to Nick of anything. He 
had traced the course of his river, as I say, and 
the real proof would be the way he should fly 
through the air. It was a case for action for 
vigorous, unmistakable action. He had done 
very little since his arrival in London but moon 
round ^fille de theatre who was taken up partly, 
though she bluffed it off, with another man, and 
partly with arranging new petticoats for a beastly 
old "poetic drama ; " but this little waste of time 
should instantly be made up. He had given him 
self a certain rope, and he had danced to the end 
of his rope, and now he would dance back. That 
was all right so right that Sherringham could 
only express to himself how right it was by 
whistling gayly. 

He whistled as he went to dine with a great 
personage, the day after his meeting with Nick 
in Balaklava Place ; a great personage to whom 
he had originally paid his respects it was high 
time the day before that meeting, the previous 
Monday. The sense of omissions to repair, of a 
superior line to take, perhaps made him study 
with more intensity to please the personage, who 



 647 

gave him ten minutes and asked him five ques 
tions. A great many doors were successively 
opened before any palpitating pilgrim who was 
about to enter the presence of this distinguished 
man ; but they were discreetly closed again be 
hind Sherringham, and I must ask the reader to 
pause with me at the nearer end of the momen 
tary vista. This particular pilgrim fortunately 
felt that he could count upon being recognized 
not only as a faithful if obscure official in the 
great hierarchy, but as a clever young man who 
happened to be connected by blood with people 
his lordship had intimately known. No doubt it 
was simply as the clever young man that Peter 
received the next morning, from the dispenser of 
his lordship s hospitality, a no e asking him to 
dine on the morrow. He had received such cards 
before, and he always responded to the invitation : 
he did so, however, on the present occasion, with 
a sense of unusual intention. In due course his 
intention was translated into words : before the 
gentlemen left the dining-room he took the liberty 
of asking his noble host if during the next few 
days there would be three minutes more that he 
might, in his extreme benevolence, bestow upon 
him. 

" What is it you want ? Tell me now," the 
master of his fate replied, motioning to the rest 
of the company to pass out and detaining Peter 
in the dining-room. 

Peter s excellent training covered every con- 



648  

tingency : he could be concise or diffuse, as the 
occasion required. Even he himself, however, 
was surprised at the quick felicity of the terms in 
which he was conscious of conveying that if it 
were compatible with higher conveniences he 
should peculiarly like to be -transferred to duties 
in a more distant quarter of the globe. Indeed, 
though Sherringham was fond of thinking of him 
self as a man of emotions controlled by training, 
it is not impossible that there was a greater 
candor than he knew in the expression of his face 
and even the slight tremor of his voice as he pre 
sented this petition. He had wished extremely 
that his manner should be good in doing so, but 
perhaps the best part of it, for his interlocutor, 
was just the part in which it failed in which it 
confessed a secret that the highest diplomacy 
would not have confessed. Sherringham re 
marked to the minister that be did n t care in the 
least where the place might be, nor how little 
coveted a post ; the further away the better and 
the climate did n t matter. He would only prefer, 
of course, that there should be really something 
to do, although he would make the best of it even 
if there were not. He stopped in time, or at 
least he thought he did, not to appear to suggest 
that he covertly sought relief from the misery of 
a hindered passion in a flight to latitudes unfa 
vorable to human life. His august patron gave 
him a sharp look which, for a moment, seemed 
the precursor of a sharper question ; but the 



 649 

rnoment elapsed and the question did not come. 
This considerate omission, characteristic of a 
true man of the world and representing quick 
guesses and still quicker indifferences, made 
Sherringham from that moment his lordship s 
ardent partisan. What did come was a good- 
natured laugh and the exclamation : " You know 
there are plenty of swamps and jungles, if you 
want that sort of thing." Sherringham replied 
that it was very much that sort of thing he did 
want ; whereupon his interlocutor continued, 
" I 11 see I 11 see : if anything turns up, you 
shall hear." 

Something turned up the very next day : our 
young man, taken at his word, found himself in 
debted to the post for a large, stiff, engraved of 
ficial letter, in which the high position of minister 
to the smallest of Central American republics 
was offered to him. The republic, though small, 
was big enough to be "shaky," and the position, 
though high, was not so exalted that there were 
not much greater altitudes above it to which it 
was a stepping-stone. Sherringham took one 
thing with another, rejoiced at his easy triumph, 
reflected that he must have been even more no 
ticed at headquarters than he had hoped, and, on 
the spot, consulting nobody and waiting for no 
thing, signified his unqualified acceptance of the 
place. Nobody with a grain of sense would have 
advised him to do anything else. It made him 
happier than he had supposed he should ever be 



650  

again ; it made him feel professionally in the 
train, as they said in Paris ; it was serious, it was 
interesting, it was exciting, and Sherringham s 
imagination, letting itself loose into the future, 
began once more to scale the crowning heights. 
It was very simple to hold one s course if one 
really tried, and he blessed the shakiness of na 
tions. A further communication informed him 
that he would be expected to return to Paris, for 
a short interval, a week later, and that he would 
before that time be advised of the date at which 
he was to proceed to his remoter duties. 



XXXIX. 

THE first thing Peter now did was to go and 
see Lady Agnes Dormer ; it is not unworthy of 
note that he took, on the other hand, no step to 
make his promotion known to Miriam Rooth. To 
render it more probable he should find her he 
went at the luncheon-hour ; and she was indeed 
on the point of sitting down to that repast with 
Grace. Biddy was not at home Biddy was 
never at home now, her mother said : she was al 
ways at Nick s place, she spent her life there, she 
ate and drank there, she almost slept the-re. 
What she found to do there, in so many hours, 
or what was the irresistible spell, Lady Agnes 
could not pretend that she had succeeded in dis 
covering. She spoke of this baleful resort only 
as " Nick s place," and she spoke of it at first as 
little as possible. She thought it very probable, 
however, that Biddy would come in early that 
afternoon : there was something or other, seme 
common social duty, that she had condescended 
to promise she would perform with Grace. Poor 
Lady Agnes, whom Sherringham found in a very 
grim yet very tremulous condition (she assured 
her visitor her nerves were all gone), almost 
abused her younger daughter for two minutes, 



652  

having evidently a deep-seated need of abusing 
some one. I must add, however, that she did n t 
wait to meet Grace s eye before recovering, by a 
rapid gyration, her view of the possibilities of 
things those possibilities from which she still 
might squeeze, as a mother, the drop that would 
sweeten h^r cup. " Dear child," she had the 
presence of mind to add, " her only fault is, after 
all, that she adores her brother. She has a ca 
pacity for adoration, and must always take her 
gospel from some one." 

Grace declared to Peter that her sister would 
have stayed at home if she had dreamed he was 
coming, and Lady Agnes let him know that she 
had heard all about the hour he had spent with the 
poor child at Nick s place, and about his extraor 
dinary good-nature in taking the two girls to the 
play. Peter lunched in Calcutta Gardens, spend 
ing an hour there which proved at first unexpect 
edly and, as it seemed to him, unfairly dismal. 
He knew from his own general perceptions, from 
what Biddy had told him and from what he had 
heard Nick say in Balaklava Place, that Lady 
Agnes would have been wounded by her son s 
apostasy ; but it was not till he saw her that he 
appreciated the dark difference this young man s 
behavior had made in the outlook of his family. 
Evidently that behavior had, as he phrased it, 
pulled the bottom out of innumerable private cal 
culations. These were things that no outsider 
could measure, and they were none of an out- 



 653 

sider s business ; it was enough that Lady Agnes 
struck him really as a woman who had received 
her death-blow. She looked ten years older; 
she was white and haggard and tragic. Her eyes 
burned with a strange intermittent fire which 
made him say to himself that her children had 
better look out for her. When they were not 
filled with this unnatural flame they were suffused 
with comfortless tears ; and altogether the af 
flicted lady was very bad very bad indeed. It 
was because he had known she would be very 
bad that he had, in his kindness, called upon her 
in exactly this manner ; but he recognized that to 
undertake to be kind to her in proportion to her 
need might carry one very far. He was glad he 
himself had not a wronged, mad mother, and he 
wondered how Nick Dormer could endure the 
home he had ruined. Apparently he did n t en 
dure it very much, but had taken definitive and 
highly convenient refuge in Rosedale Road. 

Peter s judgment of his young kinsman was 
considerably confused, and a sensible element in 
it was the consciousness that he was perhaps just 
now not in the best state of mind for judging 
him at all. At the same time, though he held in 
general that an intelligent man has a legible war 
rant for doing the particular thing he prefers, he 
could scarcely help asking himself whether, in 
the exercise of a virile freedom, it h?.d been 
absolutely indispensable that Nick should work 
such domestic woe. He admitted indeed that 






OF I 



654  

this was an anomalous vision of Nick, as the 
worker of domestic woe. Then he saw that 
Lady Agnes s grievance (there came a moment, 
later, when she asserted as much) was not quite 
what Nick, in Balaklava Place, had represented 
it with questionable taste perhaps to a mock 
ing actress ; was not a mere shocked quarrel 
with his adoption of a " low " career, or a horror, 
the old-fashioned horror, of the strange licenses 
taken by artists under pretext of being conscien 
tious : the day for this was past, and English so 
ciety thought the brush and the riddle as good as 
anything else, with two or three exceptions. It 
was not what he had taken up, but what he had 
put down, that made the sorry difference, and 
the tragedy would have been equally great if 
he had become a wine-merchant or a horse- 
dealer. Peter had gathered at first that Lady 
Agnes would not trust herself to speak directly 
of her trouble, and he obeyed what he supposed 
to be the best discretion in making no allusion 
to it. But a few minutes before they rose from 
luncheon she broke out, and when he attempted 
to utter a word of mitigation there was something 
that went to his heart in the way she returned : 
" Oh, you don t know you don t know !" 

He perceived Grace s eyes fixed upon him at 
this instant with a look of supplication, and he 
was uncertain as to what she wanted that he 
should say something more to console her mother 
or should hurry away from the subject. Grace 



 655 

looked old and plain and (he had thought, on 
coming in) rather cross, but she evidently wanted 
something. " You don t know," Lady Agnes 
repeated, with a trembling voice 4&lt; you don t 
know." She had pushed her chair a little away 
from the table ; she held her pocket-handkerchief 
pressed hard to her mouth, almost stuffed into 
it, and her eyes were fixed on the floor. She 
made him feel as if he did know knew what 
towering piles of confidence and hope had been 
dashed to the earth. Then Lady Agnes finished 
her sentence, unexpectedly : " You don t know 
what my life with my husband was." Here, on 
the other hand, Peter was slightly at fault he 
did n t exactly see what her life with her husband 
had to do with it. What was clear to him, how 
ever, was that they literally had looked for the 
very greatest things from Nick. It was not quite 
easy to see why this had been the case it had 
not been precisely Sherringham s own prefigure- 
ment. Nick appeared to have had the faculty 
of communicating that sort of faith to women ; 
he had originally given Julia a tremendous dose 
of it, though she had since shaken off the effects. 

" Do you really think he would have done such 
great things, politically speaking ? " Peter in 
quired. " Do you consider that the root of the 
matter was in him ? " 

Lady Agnes hesitated a moment, looking 
rather hard at her visitor. " I only think what 
all his friends all his father s friends have 



656  

thought. He was his father s son, after all. No 
young man ever had a finer training, and he gave, 
from the first, repeated proof of having the high 
est sort of ability, the highest sort of ambition. 
See how he got in, everywhere. Look at his 
first seat look at his second," Lady Agnes 
continued. " Look at what every one says at 
this moment." 

" Look at all the papers ! " said Grace. " Did 
you ever hear him speak ? " she asked. And 
when Peter reminded her that he had spent his 
life in foreign lands she went on : " Well, you 
lost something." 

" It was very charming," said Lady Agnes 
quietly. 

" Of course he is charming, whatever he does," 
Peter rejoined. " He 11 be a charming artist." 

"Oh, heaven!" groaned Lady Agnes, rising 
quickly. 

" He won t that s the worst," Grace amended. 
" It is n t as if he d do things people would like. 
I ve been to his place, and I never saw such a 
horrid lot of things not at all clever or pretty." 

" You know nothing whatever about the mat 
ter ! " Lady Agnes exclaimed, with unexpected 
asperity. Then she added, to Peter, that, as it 
happened, her children did have a good deal of 
artistic taste : Grace was the only one who was 
totally deficient in it. Biddy was very clever 
Biddy really might learn to do pretty things. 
And anything the poor child could learn was now 



 

no more than her duty there was so little know 
ing what the future had in store for them all. 

" You think too much of the future you take 
terribly gloomy views," said Peter, looking for 
his hat. 

" What other views can one take, when one s 
son has deliberately thrown away a fortune ? " 

" Thrown one away ? Do you mean through 
not marrying ? " 

" I mean through killing by his perversity the 
best friend he ever had." 

Sherringham stared a moment ; then, with 
laughter : " Ah, but Julia is n t dead of it ! " 

" I m not talking of Julia," said Lady Agnes, 
with a good deal of majesty. " Nick is n t merce 
nary, and I m not complaining of that." 

" She means Mr. Carteret," Grace explained. 
" He would have done anything if Nick had 
stayed in the House." 

" But he s not dead ? " 

" Charles Carteret is dying," said Lady Agnes 
"his end is very, very near. He has been a 
sort of providence to us he was Sir Nicholas s 
second self. But he won t stand such nonsense, 
and that chapter s closed." 

"You mean he has dropped Nick out of his 
will?" 

" Cut him off utterly. He has given him no 
tice." 

" The old scoundrel ! But Nick will work the 
better for that he 11 depend on himself." 



658  

" Yes, and whom shall we depend on ? " Grace 
demanded. 

" Don t be vulgar, for God s sake ! " her mother 
ejaculated, with a certain inconsequence. 

" Oh, leave Nick alone he 11 make a lot of 
money," Peter declared cheerfully, following his 
two companions into the hall. 

" I don t in the least care whether he does or 
not," said Lady Agnes. "You must come up 
stairs again I ve lots to say to you yet," she 
went on, seeing that Peter had taken his hat. 
"You must arrange to come and dine with us 
immediately ; it s only because I ve been so 
steeped in misery that I did n t write to you the 
other day directly after you called. We don t 
give parties, as you may imagine, but if you 11 
come just as we are, for old acquaintance sake " 

"Just with Nick if Nick will come and 
dear Biddy," Grace interposed. 

" Nick must certainly come, as well as dear 
Biddy, whom I hoped so much to find," Peter 
rejoined. "Because I m going away I don t 
know when I shall see them again." 

"Wait with mamma. Biddy will come in, 
now, at any moment," Grace urged. 

" You re going away ? " asked Lady Agnes, 
pausing at the foot of the stairs and turning her 
white face upon him. Something in the tone of 
her voice showed that she had been struck by 
his own tone. 

" I have had promotion, and you must congrat- 



 659 

ulate me. They are sending me out as minister 
to a little hot hole in Central America five 
thousand miles away. I shall have to go rather 
soon." 

" Oh, I m so glad ! " Lady Agnes breathed. 
Still she paused, at the foot of the stair, and still 
she gazed. 

" How very delightful, because it will lead, 
straight off, to all sorts of other good things ! " 
Grace exclaimed. 

" Oh, I m crawling up, and I m an excellency," 
Peter laughed. 

" Then if you dine with us your excellency 
must have great people to meet you." 

" Nick and Biddy they re great enough." 

" Come up-stairs come up-stairs," said Lady 
Agnes, turning quickly and beginning to ascend. 

" Wait for Biddy I m going out," Grace 
continued, extending her hand to her kinsman. 
" I shall see you again not that you care ; but 
good-by now. Wait for Biddy," the girl repeated 
in a lower tone, fastening her eyes on his with 
the same urgent, mystifying gleam that he 
thought he had perceived in them at luncheon. 

" Oh, I 11 go and see her in Rosedale Road," 
he answered. 

" Do you mean to-day now ? " 

" I don t know about to-day, but before I leave 
England." 

" Well, she 11 be in immediately," said Grace. 
" Good-by to your excellency." 



660  

" Come up, Peter please come up," called 
Lady Agnes, from the top of the stairs. 

He mounted, and when he found himself in 
the drawing-room with her, with the door closed, 
she told him that she was exceedingly interested 
in his fine prospects, that she wished to hear all 
about his new position. She rang for coffee and 
indicated the seat he would find most comfort 
able : he had for a moment an apprehension that 
she would tell him he might if he liked light a 
cigar. For Peter Sherringham had suddenly be 
come restless too restless to occupy a comfort 
able chair ; he seated himself in it only to jump 
up again, and he went to the window while he 
communicated to his hostess the very little that 
he knew about his prospective post on hearing 
a vehicle drive up to the door. A strong light 
had just been thrown into his mind, and it 
seemed to grow stronger when, looking out of 
the window, he saw Grace Dormer issue from the 
house in a bonnet and jacket which had all the 
air of having been assumed with extraordinary 
speed. Her jacket was unbuttoned, her gloves 
were dangling from her hand and she was tying 
her bonnet-strings. The vehicle into which she 
hastily sprang was a hansom-cab which had been 
summoned by the butler from the doorstep, and 
which rolled away with her after she had given 
the cabman an address. 

" Where is Grace going in such a hurry ? " he 
asked of Lady Agnes ; to which she replied that 



 66 1 

she had not the least idea her children, at the 
pass they had all come to, knocked about as they 
liked. 

Peter sat down again ; he stayed a quarter of 
an hour and then he stayed longer, and during 
this time his appreciation of what Lady Agnes 
had in her mind gathered force. She showed 
him clearly enough what she had in her mind, 
although she showed it by no clumsy nor repre 
hensible overtures. It looked out of her sombre, 
conscious eyes and quavered in her preoccupied, 
perfunctory tones. She manifested an extrava 
gant interest in his future proceedings, the prob 
able succession of events in his career, the dif 
ferent honors he would be likely to come in for, 
the salary attached to his actual appointment, the 
salary attached to the appointments that would 
follow they would be sure to, wouldn t they? 
- and what he might reasonably expect to save. 
Oh, he must save Lady Agnes was an advo 
cate of saving ; and he must take tremendous 
pains and get on and be clever and ambitious : 
he must make himself indispensable and rise to 
the top. She was urgent and suggestive and 
sympathetic ; she threw herself into the vision of 
his achievements and emoluments as if to satisfy 
a little the sore hunger with which Nick s treach 
ery had left her. This was touching to Peter 
Sherringham, and he did not remain unmoved 
even at those more importunate moments when, 
as she fell into silence, fidgeting feverishly with 



662  

a morsel of fancy-work that she had plucked 
from a table, her whole presence became an in 
tense repressed appeal to him. What that appeal 
would have been had it been uttered was: " Oh, 
Peter, take little Biddy ; oh, my dear young 
friend, understand your interests at the same 
time that you understand mine ; be kind and 
reasonable and clever ; save me all further anxi 
ety and tribulation and accept my lovely, faultless 
child from my hands." 

That was what Lady Agnes had always meant, 
more or less, that was what Grace had meant, 
and they meant it with singular lucidity on the 
present occasion. Lady Agnes meant it so much 
that from one moment to another Peter scarcely 
knew what she might do ; and Grace meant it so 
much that she had rushed away in a hansom to 
fetch her sister from the studio. Grace, how 
ever, was a fool, for Biddy certainly would n t 
come. The news of his promotion had set them 
off, adding brightness to their idea of his be 
ing an excellent match ; bringing home to them 
sharply the sense that if he were going away to 
strange countries he must take Biddy with him 
that something at all events must be settled 
about Biddy before he went. They had suddenly 
begun to throb with the conviction that they had 
no time to lose. 

Strangely enough, the perception of all this 
had not the effect of throwing Peter on the de 
fensive, or at least of making him wish to bolt 



 66$ 

When once he had discovered what was in the 
air he recognized a propriety, a real felicity in it ; 
could not deny that he was, in certain ways, a 
good match, since it was quite probable he would 
go far ; and was even generous enough (as he 
had no fear of being dragged to the altar) to en 
ter into the conception that he might offer some 
balm to a mother who had had a horrid disap 
pointment. The feasibility of marrying Biddy 
was not exactly augmented by the idea that his 
doing so would be a great offset to what Nick 
had made Lady Agnes suffer ; but at any rate 
Peter did not dislike his strenuous companion so 
much as to wish to punish her for being strenu 
ous. He was not afraid of her, whatever she 
might do ; and though he was unable to grasp 
the practical relevancy of Biddy s being produced 
on the instant, he was willing to linger for half 
an hour on the chance of her turning up. 

There was a certain contagion in Lady Agnes s 
appeal it made him appeal sensibly to himself. 
For, indeed, as it is time to say, the glass of our 
young man s spirit had been polished for that re 
flection. It was only at this moment that he be 
came really candid with himself. When he made 
up his mind that his only safety was in flight, and 
took the strong measure of asking for assistance 
to flee, he was very conscious that another and 
probably still more effectual safeguard (especially 
if the two should be conjoined) lay in the hollow 
of his hand. Julia Dallow s words in Paris had 



664  

come back to him and had seemed much wiser 
than when they were spoken : " She 11 save you 
disappointments ; you would know the worst that 
can happen to you, and it would n t be bad." 
Julia had put it into a nutshell Bicldy would 
probably save him Disappointments. And then 
she was well, she was Biddy. Peter knew bet 
ter what that was since the hour he had spent 
with her in Rosedale Road. But he had brushed 
away the sense of it, though he was aware that 
in doing so he took only half measures, was even 
guilty of a sort of fraud upon himself. If he was 
sincere in wishing to put a gulf between his fu 
ture and that portion of his past and present 
which was associated with Miriam Rooth, there 
was a very simple way to do so. Ke had dodged 
that way, dishonestly fixing upon another which, 
taken alone, was far from being so good ; but 
Lady A^nes brought him back to it. She held 
him in magnanimous contemplation of it, during 
which the safety, as Julia had called it, of the 
remedy became fascinating to his mind, espe 
cially as that safety appeared not to exclude 
a concomitant sweetness. It would be simple 
and it would swallow up his problems ; it would 
put an end to all alternatives, which, as alterna 
tives were otherwise putting an end to him, would 
be an excellent thing. It would settle the whole 
question of his future, and it was high time this 
should be settled. 

Peter took two cups of coffee while he made 



 665 

out his future with Lady Agnes, but though he 
drank them slowly he had finished them before 
Biddy turned up. He stayed three quarters of 
an hour, saying to himself that she would n t 
come why should she come? Lady Agnes 
said nothing about this ; she really, in vulgar 
vocables, said nothing about any part of the busi 
ness. But she made him fix the next day but 
one for coming to dinner, and her repeated decla 
ration that there would be no one else, not another 
creature but themselves, had almost the force of 
a legal paper. In giving his word that he would 
come without fail, and not write the next clay to 
throw them over for some function that he should 
choose to dub obligatory, Peter felt quite as if he 
were putting his name to such a document. He 
went away at half past three ; Biddy, of course, 
had n t come, and he had been certain she 
would n t. He could n t imagine what Grace s 
idea had been, nor what pretext she had put for 
ward to her sister. Whatever it had been, Biddy 
had seen through it and hated such machinations. 
Peter could only like her the better for that. 



XL. 

LADY AGNES would doubtless have clone bet 
ter, in her own interest or in that of her child, to 
have made sure of Peter s company for the very 
next evening. This she had indeed attempted, 
but the application of the idea had failed. Peter 
had a theory that he was inextricably engaged ; 
moreover her ladyship could not take upon her 
self to answer for Nick. Of course they must 
have Nick, though, to tell the truth, the hideous 
truth, she and her son were scarcely upon terms. 
Peter insisted on Nick, he wished particularly to 
see him, and he gave his hostess notice that he 
would make each of them forgive everything to 
the other. Lady Agnes declared that all her son 
had to forgive was her loving him more than her 
life, and she would have challenged Peter, had he 
allowed it, on the general ground of the compara 
tive dignity of the two arts of painting portraits 
and governing nations. Peter declined the chal 
lenge : the most he did was to intimate that he 
perhaps saw Nick more vividly as a painter than 
as a governor. Later he remembered vaguely 
something Lady Agnes had said about their be 
ing a governing family. 

He was going, by what he could ascertain, to 



, 66? 

a very queer climate, and he had many prepara 
tions to make. He gave his best attention to 
these, and for a couple of hours after leaving 
Lady Agnes he rummaged London for books 
from which he might extract information about 
his new habitat. It made apparently no great 
figure in literature, so that Peter could reflect 
that he was perhaps destined to find a salutary 
distraction in filling the void with a volume of 
impressions. After he had gathered that there 
were no books he went into the Park. He treated 
himself to an afternoon or two there when he 
happened to drop upon London in the summer : 
it refreshed his sense of the British interests he 
would have to stand up for. Moreover, he had 
been hiding more or less, and now all that was 
changed, and this was the- simplest way not to 
hide. He met a host of friends, made his situa 
tion as public as possible and accepted on the 
spot a great many invitations ; all subject, how 
ever, to the mental reservation that he should 
allow none of them to interfere with his being 
present the first night of Miriam s new venture. 
He was going to the equator to get away from 
her, but to break with the past with some decency 
of form he must show an affected interest, if he 
could muster none other, in an occasion that 
meant so much for her. The least intimate of 
her associates would do that, and Peter remem 
bered that, at the expense of good manners, he 
had stayed away from her first appearance on any 



668  

stage. He would have been shocked if he had 
found himself obliged to go back to Paris with 
out giving her his personal countenance at the 
imminent crisis, so good a right had she to ex 
pect it. 

It was nearly eight o clock when he went to 
Great Stanhope Street to dress for dinner and 
learn that a note which he found on the hall 
table, and which bore the marks of hasty dis 
patch, had come in three or four hours before. 
It exhibited the signature of Miriam Rooth and 
informed him that she positively expected him at 
the theatre at eleven o clock the next morning, 
for which hour a dress rehearsal of the revived 
play had been hurriedly determined upon, the 
first night being now definitely fixed for the im 
pending Saturday. She counted upon his atten 
dance at both ceremonies, but she had particular 
reasons for wishing to see him at the rehearsal. 
" I want you to see and judge and tell me," she 
said, " for my mind s like a flogged horse it 
won t give another kick." It was for the Satur 
day he had made Lady Agnes his promise ; he 
had thought of the possibility of the play in doing 
so, but had rested in the faith that, from valid 
symptoms, this complication would not occur till 
the following week. He decided nothing on the 
spot in relation to the conflict it was enough 
to dash off three words to Miriam to the effect 
that he would sooner perish than fail her on the 
morrow. 



2 "HE TRAGIC MUSE. 669 

He went to the theatre in the morning, and the 
episode proved curious and instructive. Though 
there were twenty people in the stalls, it bore lit 
tle resemblance to those repetitions generates to 
which, in Paris, his love of the drama had often 
attracted him, and which, taking place at night, 
in the theatre closed to the public, are virtually 
first performances with invited spectators. They 
were, to his sense, always settled and stately, and 
were rehearsals of the premiere even more than 
rehearsals of the play. The present occasion was 
less august ; it was not so much a concert as a 
confusion of sounds, and it took audible and afc 
times disputatious counsel with itself. It was 
rough and frank and spasmodic, but it was vivid 
and strong, and, in spite of the serious character 
of the piece, often exceedingly droll : while it 
gave Sherringham, oddly enough, a livelier sense 
than he had ever had of bending over the hissing, 
smoking, sputtering caldron in which a palatable 
performance is stewed. He looked into the gross 
darkness that may result from excess of light ; 
that is he understood how knocked up, on the 
eve of production, every one concerned in the 
preparation of a play might be, with nerves over 
stretched and glasses blurred, awaiting the test 
and the response, the echo to be given back by 
the big, receptive, artless, stupid, delightful pub 
lic. Sherringham s interest had been great in 
advance, and as Miriam, since his arrival, had 
taken him much into her confidence, he knew 



6/0  

what she intended to do and had discussed a 
hundred points with her. They had differed 
about some of them and she had always said : 
" Ah, but wait till you see how I shall do it at 
the time ! " That was usually her principal rea 
son and her most convincing argument. She 
had made some changes at the last hour she 
was going to do several things in another way- 
But she wanted a touching-stone, she wanted a 
fresh ear, and, as she told Sherringham when he 
went behind after the first act, that was why 
she had insisted on this private performance, to 
.which a few fresh ears were to be admitted. 
They did n t want to let her have it they were 
a parcel of donkeys ; but as to what she meant 
in general to have, she had given them a hint 
which she flattered herself they would n t soon 
forget. 

Miriam spoke as if she had had a great battle 
with her fellow-workers and had routed them ut 
terly. It was not the first time Sherringham had 
heard her talk as if such a life as hers could only 
be a fighting life, so that she frankly recognized 
the fine uses of a faculty for making a row. She 
rejoiced that she had this faculty, for she knew 
what to do with it ; and though there might be 
a certain swagger in taking such a stand in ad 
vance, when one had done the infinitely little 
that she had done, yet she trusted to the future 
to show how right she should have been in be 
lieving that a pack of idiots would never hold out 



 6/1 

against her, would know that they could n t af 
ford to. Her assumption, of course, was that she 
fought for the light and the right, for the good 
way and the thorough, for doing a thing properly 
if one did it at all. What she had really wanted 
was the theatre closed for a night, and the dress 
rehearsal, put on for a few people, given instead 
of " Yolande." That she had not got, but she 
would have it the next time. She spoke as if her 
triumphs behind the scenes as well as before 
would go by leaps and bounds, and Sherringham 
perfectly believed, for the time, that she would 
drive her coadjutors in front of her like sheep. 
Her tone was the sort of thing that would have 
struck one as preposterous if one did n t believe 
in her ; but if one did believe in her it only 
seemed thrown in with the other gifts. How was 
she going to act that night, and what could be 
said for such a hateful way of doing things ? She 
asked Sherringham questions that he was quite 
unable to answer ; she abounded in superlatives 
and tremendously strong objections. He had a 
sharper vision than usual of the queer fate, for 
a peaceable man, of being involved in a life of so 
violent a rhythm : one might as well be hooked 
to a Catharine-wheel and whiz round in flame and 
smoke, 

It was only for five minutes, in the wing, amid 
jostling and shuffling and shoving, that chey held 
this conference. Miriam, splendid in a brocaded 
anachronism, a false dress of the beginning of 



6/2  

the century, and excited and appealing, imperious 
and reckless and good-natured, full of exaggerated 
propositions, supreme determinations and comical 
irrelevancies, showed as radiant a young head as 
the stage had ever seen. Other people quickly 
surrounded her, and Sherringham saw that 
though she wanted a fresh ear and a fresh eye 
she was liable to tell those who possessed these 
advantages that they did n t know what they 
were talking about. It was rather hard with her 
(Basil Dashwood let him into this, wonderfully 
painted and in a dress even more beautiful than 
Miriam s that of a young dandy of the ages of 
silk) : if you were not in the business you were 
one kind of donkey and if you were in the busi 
ness you were another kind. Sherringham noted 
with a certain displeasure that Gabriel Nash was 
not there ; he preferred to believe that it was 
from this observation that his annoyance hap 
pened to come when Miriam, after the remark 
just quoted from Dashwood, laughing and saying 
that at any rate the thing would do because it 
would just have to do, thrust vindictively but 
familiarly into the young actor s face a magnifi 
cent feather fan. " Is n t he too lovely," she 
asked, "and does n t he know how to do it?" 
Basil Dashwood had the sense of costume even 
more than Sherringham supposed, inasmuch as 
it now appeared that he had gone profoundly into 
the question of what his clever comrade was to 
wear. He had drawn patterns and hunted up 



 6/3 

stuffs, had helped her to try on her clothes, had 
bristled with ideas and pins. It is not perfectly 
easy to explain why Sherringham grudged Gabriel 
Nash the cynicism of his absence ; it may even 
be thought singular that he should have missed 
him. At any rate he flushed a little when Mir 
iam, of whom he inquired whether she hadn t in 
vited her oldest and clearest friend, exclaimed : 
" Oh, he says he doesn t like the kitchen fire 
he only wants the pudding ! " It would have 
taken the kitchen fire to account, at that moment, 
for the red of Sherringham s cheek ; and he was 
indeed uncomfortably heated by helping to handle, 
as he phrased it, the saucepans. 

This he felt so much after he had returned to 
his seat, which he forbore to quit again till the 
curtain had fallen on the last act, that in spite of 
the high beauty of that part of the performance 
of which Miriam carried the weight there was a 
moment when his emancipation led him to give 
a suppressed gasp of relief, as if he were scram 
bling up the bank of a torrent after an immer 
sion. The girl herself, at any rate, as was wholly 
right, was of the incorruptible faith : she had 
been saturated to good purpose with the great 
spirit of Madame Carre. That was conspicuous 
as the play went on, and she watched over the 
detail with weary piety and passion. Sherring 
ham had never liked the piece itself ; he thought 
that as clumsy in form and false in feeling it did 
little honor to the British theatre ; he hated many 



6/4  

of the speeches, pitied Miriam for having to utter 
them, and considered that, lighted by that sort of 
candle, the path of fame might very well lead no 
where. 

When the rehearsal was over he went behind 
again, and in the rose-colored satin of the de nofi- 
ment the heroine of the occasion said to him : 
" Fancy my having to drag through that other 
stuff to-night the brutes ! " He was vague 
about the persons designated in this allusion, but 
he let it pass : he had at the moment a kind of 
detached foreboding of the way any gentleman 
familiarly connected with Miriam in the future 
would probably form the habit of letting objurga 
tions and some other things pass. This had be 
come, indeed, now, a frequent state of mind with 
him ; the instant he was before her, near her, 
next her, he found himself a helpless subject of 
the spell which, so far at least as he was con 
cerned, she put forth by contact and of which 
the potency was punctual and absolute : the fit 
came -on, as he said, exactly as some esteemed 
express train on a great line bangs at a given 
moment into the station. At a distance he partly 
recovered himself that was the encouragement 
for going to the shaky republic ; but as soon as 
he entered her presence his life struck him as a 
thing disconnected from his will. It was as if he 
had been one thing and his behavior another ; he 
had glimpses of pictures of this difference, drawn, 
as they might be, from the coming years little 



 6/5 

illustrative scenes in which he saw himself in 
strange attitudes of resignation, always rather 
sad and still, with a slightly bent head. Such 
images should not have been inspiring, but it is 
a fact that they were decidedly fascinating. The 
gentleman with the bent head had evidently given 
up something that was dear to him, but it was 
exactly because he had got his price that he was 
there. " Come and see me three or four hours 
hence," Miriam said " come, that is, about six. 
I shall rest till then, but I want particularly to 
talk with you. There will be no one else not 
the end of any one s nose. You 11 do me good." 
So of course Peter drove up to Balaklava Place 
about six. 



XLI. 

" I DON T know I have n t the least idea I 
don t care don t ask me," he broke out imme 
diately, in answer to some question that she put 
to him, with little delay, about his sense of the 
way she had done certain things at the theatre. 
Had she not frankly better give up that way and 
return to their first idea, the one they had talked 
over so much ? Sherringham declared that it 
was no idea of his ; that, at any rate, he should 
never have another as long as he lived ; and that, 
so help him heaven, they had talked such things 
over more than enough. 

" You re tired of me yes, already," said 
Miriam, sadly and kindly. They were alone, her 
mother had not peeped out and she had prepared 
herself to reUirn to the theatre. " However, it 
doesn t matter, and of course your head is full 
of other things. You must think me ravenously 
selfish perpetually chattering about my little 
shop. What will you have when one s a shop 
girl ? You used to like it, but then you were n t 
a minister." 

" What do you know about my being a minis- 
ter ? " Sherringham asked, leaning back in his 
chair and gazing at her from sombre eyes. Some- 



 677 

times he thought she looked better on the stage 
than she did off it, and sometimes he thought the 
exact contrary. The former of these convictions 
had held his mind in the morning, and it was now 
punctually followed by the other. As soon as 
she stepped on the boards a great and special 
alteration usually took place in her she was in 
focus and in her frame ; yet there were hours too 
in which she wore her world s face before the 
audience, just as there were hours when she wore 
her stage face in the world. She took up either 
mask as it suited her humor. To-day Sherring- 
bam was seeing each in its order, and he thought 
each the best. 

" I should know very little if I waited for you 
to tell me that s very certain," Miriam an 
swered. " It s in the papers that you ve got a 
high appointment, but I don : read the papers 
unless there s something in them about myself. 
Next week I shall devour them and think them 
driveling too, no doubt. It was Basil Dashwood 
told me, this afternoon, of your promotion he 
has seen it announced somewhere. I m delighted 
if -it gives you more money and more advantages, 
but don t expect me to be glad that you re going 
away to some distant, disgusting country." 

" The matter has only just been settled and 
we ve each been busy with our own affair::. 
Even if you had n t given me these opportuni 
ties," Sherringham went on, " I should have tried 
to see you to-day, to tell you my news and take 
leave of vou." 



6; 8  

" Take leave ? Are n t you coming to-mor 
row ? " 

" Oh, yes, I shall see you through that. But 
I shall rush away the very moment it s over." 

" I shall be much better then really I shall," 
the girl said. 

" The better you are the worse you are." 

Miriam returned his gaze with a beautiful char 
ity. " If it would do you any good I would be 
bad." 

"The worse you are the better you are!" 
laughed Sherringham. " You re a kind of de 
vouring demon." 

"Not a bit! It s you." 

"It s I? I like that." 

" It s you who make trouble, who are sore and 
suspicious and supersubtle, not taking things as 
they come and for what they are, but twisting 
them into misery and falsity. Oh, I ve watched 
you enough, my dear friend, and I ve been sorry 
for you and sorry for myself ; for I m not so 
taken up with myself as you think. I m not 
such a low creature. I m capable of gratitude, 
I m capable of affection. One may live in paint 
and tinsel, but one is n t absolutely without a soul. 
Yes, I ve got one," the girl went on, " though I 
do paint my face and practice my intonations. 
If what you are going to do is good for you I m 
very glad. If it leads to good things, to honor 
and fortune and greatness, I m enchanted. If it 
means your being away always, forever and ever, 






 6/9 

of course that s serious. You know it I 
need n t tell you I regard you as I really don t 
regard any one else. I have a^confidence in you 
ah, it s a luxury. You re a gentleman, mon 
bon ah, you re a gentleman ! It s just that. 
And then you see, you understand, and that s 
a luxury too. You re a luxury altogether, Mr. 
Sherringham. Your being where I shall never 
see you is not a thing I shall enjoy ; I know that 
from the separation of these last months after 
our beautiful life in Paris, the best thing that 
ever happened to me or that ever will. But if 
it s your career, if it s your happiness, I can miss 
you and hold my tongue. I can be disinterested 
- I can ! " 

" What did you desire me to come for ? " Sher 
ringham asked, attentive and motionless. The 
same impression, the old impression, was with 
him again ; the sense that if she was sincere it 
was sincerity of execution, if she was genuine it 
was the genuineness of doing it well. She did 
it so well now that this very fact was charming 
and touching. When she asked him, at the 
theatre, to grant her the hour in the afternoon, 
she wanted candidly (the more as she had not 
seen him at home for several days) to go over 
with him once again, on the eve of the great 
night (it would be for her second attempt the 
critics would lie so in wait the first success 
might have been a fluke), some of her recurrent 
doubts : knowing from experience what good 



680  

ideas he often had, how he could give a worrying 
alternative its quietus at the last. Then she had 
heard from Dashwood of the change in his situ 
ation, and that had really from one moment to 
the other made her think sympathetically of his 
preoccupations led her open-hancledly to drop 
her own. She was sorry to lose him and eager 
to let him know how good a friend she was con 
scious that he had been to her. But the expres 
sion of this was already, at the end of a minute, 
a strange bedevilment : she began to listen to 
herself, to speak dramatically, to represent. She 
uttered the things she felt as if they were 
snatches of old play-books, and really felt them 
the more because they sounded so well. This, 
however, did n t prevent them from being as good 
feelings as those of anybody else, and at the mo 
ment Sherringham, to still a rising emotion 
which he knew he should n t still articulated 
the challenge I have just recorded, she seemed to 
him to have at any rate the truth of gentleness 
and generosity. 

" There s something the matter with you 
you re jealous," said Miriam. "You re jealous 
of Mr. Dormer. That s an example of the way 
you tangle everything up. Lord, he won t hurt 
you, nor me either ! " 

" He can t hurt me, my dear, and neither can 
you ; for I have a nice little heart of stone and a 
smart new breastplate of iron. The interest I 
take in you is something quite extraordinary ; 



 68 1 

but the most extraordinary thing in it is that it s 
perfectly prepared to tolerate the interest of 
others." 

" The interest of others need n t trouble it 
much ! " Miriam declared. " If Mr. Dormer has 
broken off his marriage to such an awfully fine 
woman (for she is that, your swell of a sister), it 
isn t fora loud wretch like me. He s kind to 
me because that s his nature, and he notices me 
because that s his business ; but he s away up 
in the clouds a thousand miles over my head. 
He has got something on/ as they say ; he s in 
love with an idea. I think it s a shocking bad 
one, but that s his own affair. He s quite ex 
alte ; living on nectar and ambrosia what he 
has to spare for us poor crawling things on earth 
is only a few dry crumbs. I did n t even ask him 
to come to rehearsal Besides, he thinks you re 
in love with me and that it would n t be honor 
able to cut in. He s capable of that isn t it 
charming ? " 

" If he were to relent and give up his scruples, 
would you marry him ?" asked Sherringham. 

" Mercy, how you chatter about marrying ! " 
the girl laughed. "You ve all got it on the 
brain." 

" Why, I put it that way to please you, because 
you complained to me last year precisely that 
this was not what seemed generally to be 
wanted." 

"Oh, last year!" Miriam murmured. Then, 



682  

differently, " Yes, it s very tiresome ! " she ex 
claimed. 

" You told me, moreover, in Paris, more than 
once, that you would n t listen to anything but 
that." 

" Well, I won t, but I shall wait till I find a 
husband who s bad enough. One who 11 beat 
me and swindle me and spend my money on 
other women that s the sort of man for me. 
Mr. Dormer, delightful as he is, does n t come up 
to that." 

" You 11 marry Basil Dashwood," Sherringham 
replied. 

" Oh, marry ? call it marry, if you like. 
That s what poor mother says she lives in 
dread of it." 

"To this hour," said Sherringham, " I have n t 
managed to make out what your mother wants. 
She has so many ideas, as Madame Carre said." 

" She wants me to be a tremendous sort of 
creature all her ideas are reducible to that. 
What makes the muddle is that she isn t clear 
about the kind of creature she wants most. A 
great actress or a great lady sometimes she 
inclines for one and sometimes for the other ; but 
on the whole she persuades herself that a great 
actress, if she 11 cultivate the right people, may 
be a great lady. When I tell her that won t do, 
and that a great actress can never be anything 
but a great vagabond, then the dear old thing 
has tantrums, and we have scenes the most 



 683 

grotesque : they d make the fortune, for a sub 
ject, of some play-writing fellow, if he had the 
wit to guess them ; which, luckily for us, perhaps, 
he never will. She usually winds up by protesting 
devinez un peu quoi /" Miriam added. And 
as her companion professed his complete inability 
to divine : " By declaring that rather than take it 
that way I must marry you." 

" She s shrewder than I thought. It s the 
last of vanities to talk about it, but I may men 
tion in passing that if you would marry me you 
should be the greatest of all possible ladies." 

" Heavens, my dear fellow, what natural capa 
city have I for that ? " 

" You re artist enough for anything. I shall 
be a great diplomatist : my resolution is firmly 
taken. I m infinitely cleverer than you have the 
least idea of, and you shall be a great diploma 
tist s wife." 

"And the demon, the devil, the devourer and 
destroyer, that you are so fond of talking about : 
what, in such a position, do you do with that 
element of my nature ? Ou le fourrez-vous ? " 

" I 11 look after it, I 11 keep it under. Rather 
perhaps I should say, I 11 bribe it and lull it 
I 11 gorge it with earthly grandeurs." 

"That s better," said Miriam; "for a de 
mon that s kept under is a shabby little demon. 
Don t let us be shabby." Then she added : 
" Do you really go away the beginning of next 
week?" 



684  

" Monday night, -if possible." 

"That s to Paris. Before you go to your new 
post they must give you an interval here." 

" I sha n t take it I m so tremendously keen 
for my duties. I shall insist on going sooner. 
Oh, I shall be concentrated now." 

" I 11 come and act there," said Miriam, with 
her handsome smile. " I ve already forgotten 
what it was I wanted to discuss with you : it was 
some trumpery stuff. What I want to say now 
is only one thing : that it s not in the least true 
that because my life pitches me in every direc 
tion and mixes me up with all sorts of people 
or rather with one sort, mainly, poor dears ! I 
haven t a decent character, I haven t common 
honesty. Your sympathy, your generosity, your 
patience, your precious suggestions, our dear, 
sweet days last summer in Paris, I shall never for 
get. You re the best you re different from all 
the others. Think of me as you please, and make 
profane jokes about my matrimonial prospects 
I shall think of you only in one way. I have 
a great respect for you. With all my heart I 
hope you 11 be a great diplomatist. God bless 
you ! " 

Miriam got up as she spoke and in so doing 
she glanced at the clock a movement which 
somehow only added to the noble gravity of her 
discourse : it was as if she were considering his 
time, not her own. Sherringham, at this, rising 
too, took out his watch and stood a moment with 



 685 

his eyes bent upon it, though without in the least 
perceiving what the needles marked. 

" You 11 have to go, to reach the theatre at 
your usual hour, won t you ? Let me not keep 
you. That is, let me keep you only long enough 
just to say this, once for all, as I shall never 
speak of it again. I m going away to save my 
self," Sherringham went on, deliberately, standing 
before her and soliciting her eyes with his own. 
" I ought to go, no doubt, in silence, in decorum, 
in virtuous submission to hard necessity with 
out asking for credit or sympathy, without provok 
ing any sort of scene or calling attention to my 
fortitude. But I can t upon my soul I can t. I 
can go, I can see it through, but I can t hold my 
tongue. I want you to know all about it, so that 
over there, when I m bored to death, I shall at 
least have the exasperatingly vain consolation of 
feeling that you do know and that it does 
neither you nor me any good ! " 

He paused a moment, upon which Miriam 
asked, " That I do know what ? " 

"That I have a consuming passion for you and 
that it s impossible." 

" Ah, impossible, my friend ! " she sighed, but 
with a quickness in her assent. 

" Very good ; it interferes, the gratification of 
it would interfere fatally, with the ambition of 
each of us. Our ambitions are odious, but we 
are tied fast to them." 

" Ah, why ain t we simple ? " Miriam quavered. 



686  

" Why ain t we of the people comme tout le 
monde just a man and a girl liking each 
other ? " 

Sherringham hesitated a moment ; she was so 
tenderly mocking, so sweetly ambiguous, as she 
said this. " Because we are precious asses ! 
However, I m simple enough, after all, to care 
for you as I have never cared for any human 
creature. You have, as it happens, a personal 
charm for me that no one has ever approached, 
and from the top of your splendid head to the 
sole of your theatrical shoe (I could go down on 
my face there, abjectly and kiss it!) every 
inch of you is dear and delightful to me. There 
fore good-by." 

Miriam stared, at this, with wider eyes : he had 
put the matter in a way that struck her. For a 
moment, all the same, he was afraid she would 
reply as if she had often heard that sort of thing 
before. But she was too much moved the pure 
color that had risen to her face showed it to 
have recourse to this particular facility. She 
was moved even to the glimmer of tears, though 
she gave him her hand with a smile. " I m so 
glad you ve said all that ; for from you I know 
what it means. Certainly, it s better for you to 
go away. Of course it s all wrong, is n t it ? 
but that s the only thing it can be : therefore it s 
all right, is n t it ? Some day when we re great 
people we 11 talk these things over ; then we 
shall be quiet, we shall be at p:ace let us hope 



 68? 

so, at least and better friends than people will 
know." She paused a moment, smiling still ; 
then she said, while he held her hand : "Don t, 
doiit come to-morrow night." 

With this she attempted to draw her hand away, 
as if everything were settled and over ; but the 
effect of her movement was that, as he held her 
hand tight, he was simply drawn toward her and 
close to her. The effect of this, in turn, was 
that, releasing her only to possess her more, he 
seized her in his arms and breatjjng deeply, " I 
love you ! " clasped her in a long embrace. It 
was so long that it gave the door of the room 
time to open before either of them had taken no 
tice. Mrs. Rooth, who had not peeped in before, 
peeped in now, becoming in this matter witness 
of an incident she could scarcely have expected. 
The unexpected, indeed, for Mrs. Rooth, had 
never been an insuperable element in things ; it 
was her system, in general, to be too much in 
harmony to be surprised. As the others turned 
round they saw her standing there and smiling at 
them, and heard her ejaculate, with wise indul 
gence 

" Oh, you extravagant children ! " 

Miriam brushed off her tears, quickly but un- 
confusedly. " He s going away he s bidding 
us farewell." 

Sherringham it was perhaps a result of his 
general agitation laughed out at the "us" (he 
had already laughed at the charge of puerility), 



688  

and Mrs. Rooth returned, " Going away ? Ah, 
then I must have one too ! And she held out 
both her hands. Sherringham stepped forward 
and, taking them, kissed her respectfully on each 
cheek, in the foreign manner, while she contin 
ue;! : " Our dear old friend our kind, gallant 
gentleman ! " 

" The gallant gentleman has been promoted to 
a great post the proper reward of his gallantry," 
Miriam said. " He s going out as minister to 
some impossible place where is it?" 

"As minister how very charming ! We are 
getting on." And the old woman gave him a 
curious little upward interrogative leer. 

" Oh, well enough. One must take what one 
can get," he answered. 

" You 11 get everything now, I m sure, sha n t 
you ? " Mrs. Rooth asked, with an inflection that 
called back to him, comically (the source was so 
different), the very vibrations he had noted the 
day before in Lady Agnes s voice. 

" He s going to glory and he 11 forget all 
about us forget that he has ever known such 
people. So we shall never see him again, and 
it s better so. Good-by, goocl-by," Miriam re- 
repeated ; " the brougham must be there, but I 
won t take you. I want to talk to mother about 
you, and we shall say things not fit for you to 
hear. Oh, I ll let you know what we lose 
don t be afraid," she added to Mrs. Rooth. 
" He s the rising star of diplomacy." 



 689 

" I knew it from the first I know how things 
turn out for such people as you ! " cried the old 
woman, gazing fondly at Sherringham. " But 
you don t mean to say you re not coming to-mor 
row night ? " 

"Don t don t; it s great folly," Miriam in 
terposed ; " and it s quite needless, since you 
saw me to-day." 

Sherringham stood looking from the mother to 
the daughter, the former of whom broke out to 
the latter : " Oh, you dear rogue, to say one has 
seen you yet ! You know how you 11 come up to 
it ; you 11 be transcendent." 

" Yes, I shall be there certainly," said Sher 
ringham, at the door, to Mrs. Rooth. 

11 Oh, you dreadful goose ! " Miriam called after 
him. But he went out without looking round at 
her. 



XLII. 

NICK DORMER had for the hour quite taken 
up his abode at his studio, where Biddy usually 
arrived after breakfast to give him news of the 
state of affairs in Calcutta Gardens, and where 
many letters and telegrams were now addressed 
to him. Among such missives, on the morning 
of the Saturday on which Peter Sherringham had 
promised to dine at the other house, was a note 
from Miriam Rooth, informing Nick that if he 
should not telegraph to put her off she would 
turn up about half past eleven, probably with her 
mother, for just one more sitting. She added 
that it was a nervous day for her and that she 
could n t keep still, so that it would really be 
very kind to let her come to him as a refuge. 
She wished to stay away from the theatre, where 
everything was now settled (or so much the worse 
for the others if it was n t), till the evening, but 
if she were left to herself should be sure to go 
there. It would keep her quiet and soothe her 
to sit he could keep her quiet (he was such a 
blessing that way !) at any time. Therefore she 
would give him two or three hours or rather 
she would ask him for them if he did n t posi 
tively turn her from the door. 



, 691 

It had not been definite to Nick that he 
wanted another sitting at all for the slight work, 
as he held it to be, that Miriam had already 
helped him to achieve. He regarded this work 
as a kind of pictorial obiter dictum : he had made 
what he could of it and would have been at a 
loss to see how he could make more. If it was 
not finished, this was because it was not finish- 
able ; at any rate he had said all he had to say 
in that particular phrase. Nick Dormer, as it 
happened, was not just now in the highest spir 
its ; his imagination had within two or three days 
become conscious of a check which he tried to 
explain by the idea of a natural reaction. Any 
important change, any new selection, in one s 
life was exciting, and exaggerate that importance 
and one s own as little as one would, there was 
an inevitable strong emotion in renouncing, in 
the face of considerable opposition, one sort of 
responsibility for another sort. That made life 
not perhaps necessarily joyous, but decidedly 
thrilling, for the hour; and it was all very well 
till the thrill abated. When this occurred, as it 
inevitably would, the romance and the poetry of 
the thing would be exchanged for the flatness 
and the prose. It was to these latter elements 
that Nick Dormer had waked up pretty wide on 
this particular morning ; and the prospect was 
not appreciably more blooming from the fact 
that he had warned himself in advance that it 
would be dull. He had known how dull it would 



692  

be, but now he would have time to learn that 
even better. A reaction was a reaction, but it 
was not after all a catastrophe. A part of its 
privilege would be to make him ask himself if 
he had not committed a great mistake ; that 
privilege would doubtless even remain within the 
limits of its nature in leading him to reply to 
this question in the affirmative. But he would 
live to withdraw such a concession this was 
the first thing to bear in mind. 

He was occupied, even while he dressed, in 
the effort to get forward, mentally, with some 
such retractation, when, by the first post, Mir 
iam s note arrived. At first it did little to help 
him in his effort, for it made him contrast her 
eagerness with his own want of alacrity and ask 
himself what the deuce he should do with her. 
Ambition, with her, was always on the charge, 
and she was not a person to conceive that others 
might, in bad moments, listen for the trumpet in 
vain. It would never have occurred to her that 
only the day before he had spent a portion of the 
afternoon quite at the bottom of the hill. He 
had in fact turned into the National Gallery and 
had wandered about there for more than one 
hour, and it was just while he did so that the 
immitigable recoil had begun perversely to set 
in. And the perversity was all the greater from 
the circumstance that if the experience was de 
pressing it was not because he had been discour 
aged beyond measure by the sight of the grand 



 693 

things that had been done things so much 
grander than any that would ever bear his signa 
ture. That variation he was duly acquainted 
with and should taste in abundance again. What 
had happened to him, as he passed on this occa 
sion from Titian to Rubens and from Gainsbor 
ough to Rembrandt, was that he found himself 
calling the whole art literally into question. 
What was it, after all, at the best, and why had 
people given it so high a place ? Its weakness, 
its narrowness appeared to him ; tacitly blasphem 
ing, he looked at several world-famous perform 
ances with a lustreless eye. That is, he blas 
phemed if it were blasphemy to say to himself 
that, with all respect, they were a poor business, 
only well enough in their small way. The force 
that produced them was not one of the greatest 
forces in human affairs ; their place was inferior 
and their connection with the life of man casual 
and slight. They represented so inadequately 
the idea, and it was the idea that won the race, 
that in the long run came in first He had in- 
contestably been in much closer relation to the 
idea a few months before than he was to-day : it 
made up a great deal for the bad side of politics 
that they were after all a clumsy system for ap 
plying and propagating the idea. The love of it 
had really been, at certain hours, at the bottom of 
his disposition to follow them up; though this 
had not been what he used to talk of most with 
his political comrades or even with Julia. Cer- 



694  

tainly, political as Julia was, he had not conferred 
with her much about the idea. However, this 
might have been his own fault quite as much as 
hers, and she probably took such an enthusiasm 
for granted she took such a tremendous lot of 
things for granted. On the other hand he had 
put this enthusiasm forward frequently in his 
many discussions with Gabriel Nash, with the 
effect, it is true, of making that worthy scoff 
transcendentally at what he was pleased to term 
his hypocrisy. Gabriel maintained precisely that 
there were more ideas, more of those that man 
lived by, in a single room of the National Gal 
lery than in all the statutes of Parliament. Nick 
had replied to this more than once that the de 
termination of what man did live by was re 
quired ; to which Nash had retorted (and it was 
very rarely that he quoted Scripture) that it was 
at any rate not by bread and butter alone. The 
statutes of Parliament gave him bread and butter 
tout au plus. 

Nick Dormer, at present, had no pretension of 
trying this question over again : he reminded 
himself that his ambiguity was subjective, as the 
philosophers said ; the result of a mood which in 
due course would be at the mercy of another 
mood. It made him curse, and cursing, as a 
finality, was shaky ; so he would throw out a 
platform beyond it. The time far beyond others 
to do one s work was when it did n t seem worth 
doing, for then one gave it a brilliant chance, 



 695 

that of resisting the stiffest test of all the test 
of striking one as very bad. To do the most 
when there would be the least to be got by it 
was to be most in the true spirit of production. 
One thing, at any rate, was very certain, Nick 
reflected : nothing on earth would induce him to 
change back again ; not even if this twilight of 
the soul should last for the rest of his days. He 
hardened himself in his posture with a good con 
science, which, had they had a glimpse of it, 
would have made him still more diverting to 
those who already thought him so ; but now, by 
good fortune, Miriam suddenly knocked together 
the little bridge that was wanted to carry him 
over to more elastic ground. If he had made his 
sketch it was a proof that he had done her, and 
that he had done her flashed upon him as a 
sign that she would be still more feasible. He 
found his platform, as I have called it, and for 
a moment, in his relief, he danced upon it. He 
sent out a telegram to Balaklava Place requesting 
his beautiful sitter by no manner of means to fail 
him. When his servant came back, it was to 
usher into the studio Peter Sherringham, whom 
the man had apparently found at the door. 

The hour was so early for social intercourse 
that Nick immediately guessed his visitor had 
come on some rare errand ; but this inference 
was instantly followed by the reflection that 
Peter might after all only wish to make up by 
present zeal for not having been near him before. 



696  

He forgot that, as he had subsequently learned 
from Biddy, their foreign, or all but foreign, 
cousin had spent an hour in Rosedale Road, miss 
ing him there but pulling out Miriam s portrait, 
the day of his own hurried visit to Beauc!ere. 
These young men were not on a ceremonious 
footing, and it was not in Nick s nature to keep 
a record of civilities rendered or omitted ; never 
theless he had been vaguely conscious that dur 
ing a stay in London, on Peter s part, which 
apparently was stretching itself out, he and his 
kinsman had foregathered less than of yore. It 
was indeed an absorbing moment in the career 
of each, but at the same time that he recognized 
this truth Nick remembered that it was not im 
possible Peter might have taken upon himself to 
resent some supposititious failure of considera 
tion for Julia ; though this would have been 
stupid, and the newly appointed minister (to he 
had forgotten where) cultivated a finer habit. 
Nick held that as he had treated Julia with stu 
dious generosity she had nothing whatever to 
reproach him with ; so her brother had therefore 
still less. It was at any rate none of her bro 
ther s business. There were only two things 
that would have made Nick lukewarm about dis 
posing in a few frank words of all this : one of 
them his general hatred of talking of his private 
affairs (a reluctance in which he and Peter were 
well matched) ; and the other a particular sen 
timent which would have involved more of a 



 697 

confession, and which could not be otherwise de 
scribed than as a perception that the most defi 
nite and even most pleasant consequence of the 
collapse of his engagement was, as it happened, 
an extreme consciousness of freedom. Nick 
Dormer s observation was of a different sort from 
his cousin s ; he noted much less the signs of 
the hour and kept altogether a looser register of 
life ; nevertheless, just as one of our young men 
had during these days in London found the air 
peopled with personal influences, the concussion 
of human atoms, so the other, though only ask 
ing to live without too many questions and work 
without too many disasters, to be glad and sorry 
in short on easy terms, had become aware of a 
certain social tightness, of the fact that life is 
crowded and passion restless, accident frequent 
and community inevitable. Everybody with 
whom one had relations had other relations too, 
and even optimism was a mixture and peace an 
I/embroilment. The only chance was to let every- 
Jjthing be embroiled but one s temper and every- 
[ thing spoiled but one s work. It must be added 
that Nick sometimes took precautions against 
irritation which were in excess of the danger, as 
departing travelers, about to whiz through for 
eign countries, study phrase-books for combina 
tions of words they will never use. He was at 
home in the brightness of things his longest 
excursions across the border were short. He 
had a dim sense that Peter considered that he 



698  

made him uncomfortable, and might have come 
now to tell him so ; in which case he should be 
sorry for Peter in various ways. But as soon as 
his visitor began to speak Nick felt suspicion 
fade into old friendliness, and this in spite of the 
fact that Peter s speech had a slightly exagger 
ated promptitude, like the promptitude of busi 
ness, which might have denoted self-conscious 
ness. To Nick it quickly appeared better to be 
glad than to be sorry : this simple argument was 
more than sufficient to make him glad Peter was 
there. 

" My dear Nick, it s an unpardonable hour, 
is n t it ? I was n t even sure you d be up, and 
yet I had to risk it, because my hours are num 
bered. I m going away to-morrow," Peter went 
on ; "I ve a thousand things to do. I ve had 
no talk with you this time such as we used to 
have of old (it s an irreparable loss, but it s your 
fault, you know), and as I ve got to rush about 
all day I thought I d just catch you before any 
one else does." 

" Some one has already caught me, but there s 
plenty of time," Nick returned. 

Peter stared a moment, as if he were going to 
ask a question : then he thought better of this 
and said : "I see, I see. I m sorry to say I Ve 
only a few minutes at best." 

" Man of crushing responsibilities, you ve come 
to humiliate me! " Nick exclaimed. " I know all 
about it." 



 699 

" It s more than I do, then. That s not what 
I ve come for, but I shall be delighted if I humil 
iate you a little by the way. I ve two things in 
mind, and I 11 mention the most difficult first. I 
came here the other day the day after my ar 
rival in town." 

" Ah, yes, so you did ; it was very good of 
you," Nick interrupted, as if he remembered. 
" I ought to have returned your visit, or left a 
card, or written my name, or something, in Great 
Stanhope Street, ought n t I ? You had n t got 
this new thing then, or I would have done so." 

Peter eyed him a moment. " I say, what s the 
matter with you ? Am I really unforgivable for 
having taken that liberty?" 

" What liberty ? " Nick looked now as if there 
were nothing whatever the matter with him, and 
indeed his visitor s allusion was not clear to him. 
He was thinking only for the instant of Biddy, of 
whom and whose secret inclinations Grace had 
insisted on talking to him. They were none of 
his business, and if he would not for the world 
have let the girl herself suspect that he had vio 
lent lights on what was most screened and cur- 
tained in her, much less would he have made 
Peter a clumsy present of this knowledge. Grace 
had a queer theory that Peter treated Biddy badly 
treated them all, somehow, badly ; but Grace s 
zeal (she had plenty of it, though she affected all 
sorts of fine indifference) almost always took the 
form of being wrong. Nick wanted to do only 



700  

what Biddy would thank him for, and he knew 
very well what she would n t. She wished him 
and Peter to be great friends, and the only ob 
stacle to this was that Peter was too much of a 
diplomatist. Peter made him, for an instant, 
think of her and of the hour they had lately spent 
together in the studio in his absence an hour 

o 

of which Biddy had given him a history full of 
detail and of omissions ; and this in turn brought 
Nick s imagination back to his visitor s own side 
of the matter. That complexity of things of 
which the sense had lately increased with him, 
and to which it was owing that any thread one 
might take hold of would probably lead one to 
something discomfortable, was illustrated by the 
fact that while poor Biddy was thinking of Peter 
it was ten to one that poor Peter was thinking of 
Miriam Rooth. All this danced before Nick s 
intellectual vision for a space briefer than my too 
numerous words. 

" I pitched into your treasures I rummaged 
among your canvases," Peter said. " Biddy had 
nothing whatever to do with it she maintained 
an attitude of irreproachable reserve. It has 
been on my conscience all these days, and I 
ought to have done penance before. I have been 
putting it off partly because I am so ashamed of 
my indiscretion. Que voulez-vons, my dear Nick ? 
My provocation was great. I heard you had been 
painting Miss Rooth, so that I could n t restrain 
my curiosity. I simply went into that corner and 



 70 1 

struck out there a trifle wildly, no doubt. 
I dragged the young lady to the light your 
sister turned pale as she saw me. It was a good 
deal like breaking open one of your letters, 
was n t it ? However, I assure you it s all right, 
for I congratulate you both on your style and on 
your correspondent." 

" You re as clever, as witty, as humorous, as 
ever, old boy," Nick rejoined, going himself into 
the corner designated by his companion and lay 
ing his hands on the same canvas. " Your curi 
osity is the highest possible tribute to my little 
attempt, and your sympathy sets me right with 
myself. There is she again," Nick went on, 
thrusting the picture into an empty frame ; "you 
shall see her whether you wish to or not." 

" Right with yourself ? You don t mean to say 
you ve been wrong ! " Sherringham returned, 
standing opposite the portrait. 

" Oh, I don t know ; I Ve been kicking up such 
a row ; anything is better than a row." 

" She s awfully good she s awfully true," 
said Sherringham. " You ve done more to it, 
since the other day ; you ve put in several 
things." 

" Yes, but I ve worked distractedly. I ve not 
altogether conformed to the celebrated recom 
mendation about being off with the old love." 

" With the old love ? " Sherringham repeated, 
looking hard at the picture. 

" Before you are on with the new ! " Nick had 



7O2  

no sooner uttered these words than he colored ; 
it occurred to him that Peter would probably 
think he was alluding to Julia. He therefore 
added quickly : " It is n t so easy to cease to 
represent an affectionate constituency. Really, 
most of my time for a fortnight has been given 
up to letter-writing. They ve all been unex 
pectedly charming. I should have thought they 
would have loathed and despised me. But not 
a bit of it ; they cling to me fondly they strug 
gle with me tenderly. I ve been down to talk 
with them about it, and we ve passed the most 
sociable, delightful hours. I ve designated my 
successor ; I ve felt a good deal like the Emperor 
Charles the Fifth when about to retire to the 
monastery of Yuste. The more I ve seen of 
them, in this way, the more I ve liked them, and 
they declare it has been the same with themselves 
as regards me. We spend our time in assuring 
each other that we have n t begun to know each 
other till now. In short, it s all wonderfully 
jolly, but it is n t business. C est magnifique, 
mais ce n est pas la guerre." 

"They are not so charming as they might be 
if they don t offer to keep you and let you 
paint." 

" They do, almost ; it s fantastic," said Nick. 
" Remember they have n t seen any of my paint 
ing yet." 

" Well, I m sorry for you ; we live in too en 
lightened an age," Peter declared. "You can t 



 703 

suffer for art. Your experience is interesting ; 
it seems to show that, at the tremendous pitch 
of civilization we ve reached, you can t surfer 
from anything but hunger." 

"I shall doubtless do that in abundance." 

" Never, never, when you paint as well as 
this." 

"Oh, come, you re too good to be true," Nick 
replied. " But where did you learn that one s 
larder is full in proportion as one s work is 
fine?" 

Peter gave him no satisfaction on this curious 
point he only continued to look at the picture ; 
after which, in a moment, he said : " I ll give you 
your price for it on the spot." 

" Dear boy, you re so magnanimous that you 
shall have it for nothing ! " Nick exclaimed, pass 
ing his arm into his companion s. 

Peter was silent at first. " Why do you call 
me magnanimous ? " 

"Oh, bless my soul, it s hers I forget!" 
laughed Nick, failing in his turn to answer the 
other s inquiry. "But you shall have another." 

" Another ? Are you going to do another ? " 

"This very morning. That is, I shall begin it. 
I ve heard from her ; she s coming to sit a 
short time hence." 

Peter turned away a little at this, releasing 
himself, and, as if the movement had been an 
effect of Nick s words, looked at his watch ear 
nestly, to dissipate that appearance. He fell back, 



704  

to consider the picture from further off. " The 
more you do her the better ; she has all the qual 
ities of a great model. From that point of view 
it s a pity she has another trade: she might 
make so good a thing of this one. But how shall 
you do her again ? " Sherringham continued, in 
genuously. 

" Oh, I can scarcely say ; we 11 arrange some 
thing ; we 11 talk it over. It s extraordinary how 
well she enters into what one wants : she knows 
more than one does one s self. She isn t the 
first comer. However, you know all about that 
since you invented her, didn t you? That s 
what she says ; she s awfully sweet on you," 
Nick pursued. " What I ought to do is to try 
something as different as possible from that 
thing ; not the sibyl, the muse, the tremendous 
creature, but the charming woman, the person 
one knows, in different gear, as she appears en 
mile, as she calls it. I 11 do something really 
serious and send it to you out there with my re 
spects. It will remind you of home, and perhaps 
a little even of me. If she knows it s for you 
she 11 throw herself into it in the right spirit. 
Leave it to us, my dear fellow ; we 11 turn out 
something good." 

" It s jolly to hear you ; but I shall send you a 
cheque," said Peter. 

" I suppose it s all right in your position, but 
you re too proud," his kinsman answered. 

" What do you mean by my position ? " 



 705 

" Your exaltation, your high connection with 
the country, your treating with sovereign powers 
as the representative of a sovereign power. Is n t 
that what they call em ? " 

Sherringham, who had turned again toward 
his companion, listened to this with his eyes fixed 
on Nick s face, while at the same time he once 
more drew forth his watch. "Brute!" he ex 
claimed familiarly, at the same time dropping his 
eyes on the watch. " At what time did you say 
you expected your sitter?" 

" Oh, we ve plenty of time ; don t be afraid of 
letting me see you agitated by her presence." 

" Brute ! " Sherringham again ejaculated. 

This friendly personal note cleared the air, 
made the communication between the two men 
closer. " Stay with me and talk to me," said 
Nick; "I dare say it s good for me. Heaven 
knows when I shall see you so independently 
again." 

" Have you got something more to show me, 
then some other work ? " Sherringham asked. 

" Must I bribe you by setting my sign-boards 
in a row ? You know what I ve done ; by which 
I mean of course you know what I haven t done. 
My work, as you are so good as to call it, has 
hitherto been horrible rot. I ve had no time, no 
opportunity, no continuity. I must go and sit 
down in a corner and learn my alphabet. That 
thing is n t good ; what I shall do for you won t 
be good. Don t protest, my dear fellow ; no- 



706  

thing will be fit to look at for a long time. And 
think of my ridiculous age. As the good people 
say (or don t they say it ?) it s a rum go. It 
won t be amusing." 

&gt; " Oh, you re so clever you 11 get on fast," 
Sherringham replied, trying to think how he 
could most directly disobey his companion s in 
junction not to protest. 

" I mean it won t be amusing for others," said 
Nick, unperturbed by this violation. " They 
want results, and small blame to them." 

" Well, whatever you do, don t talk like Mr. 
Gabriel Nash," Peter went on. " Sometimes I 
think you re just going to." 

Nick stared a moment. " Why, he never would 
have said that. They want results, the damned 
fools that would have been more in his 
key." 

"It s the difference of a nuance. And are you 
extraordinarily happy ? " Peter added, as Nick 
now obliged him by arranging half a dozen can 
vases so that he could look at them. 

"Not so much so, doubtless, as the artistic life 
ought to make one : because all one s people 
are not so infatuated as one s electors. But 
little by little I m learning the beauty of obsti 
nacy." 

" Your mother s very bad ; I lunched with her 
the day before yesterday." 

"Yes, I know I know," said Nick hastily; 
"but it s too late it s too late. I must just 



 707 

peg away here and not mind. I ve after all a 
great advantage in my life." 

Sherringham hesitated. " And that would 
be?" 

" Oh, I mean knowing what I want to do ; 
that s everything, you know." 

" It s an advantage, however, that you ve only 
just come in for, is n t it ? " 

"Yes, but having waited only makes me prize 
it the more. I ve got it now ; and it makes up, 
for the present, for the absence of some other 
things." 

Again Sherringham was silent awhile. " That 
sounds a little flat," he remarked at last. 

" It depends upon what you compare it with. 
It s rather more pointed than the House of Com 
mons." 

" Oh, I never thought I should like that." 

There was another -pause, during which Nick 
moved about the room, turning up old sketches 
to see if he had anything more to show his vis 
itor, while Sherringham continued to look at the 
unfinished and in some cases, as it seemed to 
him, unpromising productions already submitted 
to his attention. They were much less interest 
ing than the portrait of Miriam Rooth, and, it 
would have appeared, much less significant of 
ability. For that particular effort Nick s talent 
had taken an unprecedented spring. This was 
the reflection that Peter made, as he had made 
it, intensely, before ; but the words he presently 



708  

uttered had no visible connection with it. They 
only consisted of the abrupt inquiry : " Have you 
heard anything from Julia? " 
" Not a syllable. Have you ? " 
" Dear, no ; she never writes to me." 
" But won t she, on the occasion of your promo 
tion ? " 

"I dare say not," said Peter: and this was the 
only reference to Mrs. Daliow that passed be 
tween her brother and her late intended. It left 
a slight agitation of the atmosphere, which Sher- 
ringham proceeded to allay by an allusion com 
paratively speaking more relevant. He expressed 
disappointment that Biddy should not have come 
in ; having had an idea that she was always in 
Rosedale Road of a morning. That was the 
other moiety of his present errand the wish to 
see her and give her a message for Lady Agnes, 
upon whom, at so early an hour, he had not pre 
sumed to intrude in Calcutta Gardens. Nick re 
plied that Biddy did in point of fact almost always 
turn up, and for the most part early ; she came 
to wish him good-morning and start him for the 
clay. She was a devoted Electra, laying a cool, 
healing hand on a distracted Orestes. He re 
minded Peter, however, that he would have a 
chance of seeing her that evening, and of seeing 
Lady Agnes ; for was n t he to do them the honor 
of dining in Calcutta Gardens ? Biddy, the day 
before, had arrived full of that excitement. Peter 
explained that this was exactly the sad subject of 



 709 

his actual demarche : the project of the dinner in 
Calcutta Gardens had, to his exceeding regret, 
fallen to pieces. The fact was (did n t Nick 
know it ?) the night had been suddenly and per 
versely fixed for Miriam s premiere, and he was 
under a definite engagement with her not to stay 
away from it. To add to the bore of the thing 
he was obliged to return to Paris the very next 
morning. He was quite awfully sorry, for he had 
promised Lady Agnes : he did n t understand 
then about Miriam s affair, in regard to which he 
had given a previous pledge. He was more sorry 
than he could say, but he could never fail Miss 
Rooth : he had professed from the first an interest 
in her which he must live up to a little more. 
This was his last chance he hadn t been near 
her at the trying time she first produced herself. 
And the second night of the play wouldn t do 
it must be the first or nothing. Besides, he 
could n t wait over till Monday. 

While Peter enumerated these complications 
his companion was occupied in polishing with a 
cloth a palette that he had just been scraping. 
"I see what you mean I m very sorry too," 
said Nick. " I m sorry you can t give my mother 
this joy I give her so little." 

" My dear fellow, you might give her a little 
more. It s rather too much to expect me to 
make up for your omissions ! " 

Nick looked at Peter with a moment s fixedness 
while he rubbed his palette ; and for that moment 



710  

he felt the temptation to reply : " There s a way 
you could do that, to a considerable extent I 
think you guess it which wouldn t be intrin 
sically disagreeable." But the impulse passed, 
without expressing itself in speech, and he simply 
answered : " You can make this all clear to Biddy 
when she comes, and she 11 make it clear to my 
mother." 

" Poor little Biddy ! " Sherringham mentally 
exclaimed, thinking of the girl with that job be 
fore her ; but what he articulated was that this 
was exactly why he had come to the studio. He 
had inflicted his company on Lady Agnes on 
Thursday, and had partaken of a meal with her, 
but he had not seen Biddy, though he had waited 
for her, hoping she would come in. Now he 
would wait for her again she was thoroughly 
worth it. 

" Patience, patience, you ve always me," said 
Nick ; to which he subjoined, " If it s a question 
of going to the play I scarcely -see why you 
should n t dine at my mother s all the same. Peo 
ple go to the play after dinner." 

" Yes, but it would n t be fair, it would n t be 
decent : it s a case when I must be in my seat 
from the rise of the curtain. I should force your 
mother to dine an hour earlier than usual, and 
then, in return for this courtesy, go off to my en 
tertainment at eight o clock, leaving her and 
Grace and Biddy languishing there. I wish I had 
proposed in time that they should go with me," 
Peter continued, not very ingenuously. 



 /I I 

" You might do that still," Nick suggested. 

" Oh, at this time of day it would be impossible 
to get a box." 

" I 11 speak to Miss Rooth about it, if you like, 
when she comes," smiled Nick. 

" No, it would n t do," said Peter, turning away 
and locking once more at his watch. He made 
tacitly the addition that, still less than asking 
Lady Agnes, for his convenience, to dine early, 
would this be decent, would it be fair. His tak 
ing Biddy the night he dined with her and with 
Miss Tressilian had been something very like a 
violation of those proprieties. He could n t say 
this to Nick, who remarked in a moment that it 
was all right, for Peter s action left him his own 
freedom. 

" Your own freedom ? " Peter echoed interroga 
tively, turning round. 

" Why, you see now I can go to the theatre 
myself." 

" Certainly ; I had n t thought of that. You 
would have been going." 

I gave it up for the prospect of your com 
pany." 

" Upon my word, you re too good I don t 
deserve such sacrifices," said Sherringham, who 
saw from Nick s face that this was not a figure of 
speech but the absolute truth. "Did n t it, how 
ever, occur to you that, as it would turn out, I 
might that I even naturally would myself be 
going ? " he added. 



712  

Nick broke into a laugh. "It would have oc 
curred to me if I understood a little better " 
And he paused, still laughing. 

" If you understood a little better what ? " 
Peter demanded. 

" Your situation, simply." 

Peter looked at him a moment. " Dine with 
me to-night, independently ; we 11 go to the thea 
tre together, and then you 11 understand it." 

" With pleasure, with pleasure : we 11 have a 
jolly evening," said Nick. 

" Call it jolly if you like. When did you say 
she was coming ? " Peter asked. 

" Biddy ? Oh, probably, as I tell you, at any 
moment." 

" I mean the great Miriam," Peter replied. 

" The great Miriam, if she s punctual, will be 
here in about forty minutes." 

" And will she be likely to find your sis 
ter ? " 

" My dear fellow, that will depend on whether 
my sister remains to see her." 

Exactly; but the point is whether you ll 
allow her to remain, is n t it ? " 

Nick looked slightly mystified. " Why should 
n t she do as she likes ?" 

" In that case she 11 probably go." 

" Yes, unless she stays." 

Don t let her," Peter dropped; "send her 
away." And to explain this he added, " It does 
n t seem exactly the right sort of thing, young 



 713 

girls meeting actresses." His explanation, in 
turn, struck him as requiring another clause ; so 
he went on : " At least it is n t thought the right 
sort of thing abroad, and even in England my 
foreign ideas stick to me." 

Even with this amplification, however, his prop 
osition evidently still appeared to his companion 
to have a flaw ; which, after he had considered it 
a moment, Nick exposed in the simple words : 
"Why, you originally introduced them, in Paris 
Biddy and Miss Rooth. Did n t they meet at 
your rooms and fraternize, and wasn t that much 
more abroad than this ? " 

" So they did, but she did n t like it," Peter 
answered, suspecting that, for a diplomatist, he 
looked foolish. 

"Miss Rooth did n t like it ?" Nick persisted. 

" That I confess I ve forgotten. Besides, she 
was not an actress then. What I remember 
is that Biddy was n t particularly pleased with 
her." 

" Why, she thought her wonderful praised 
her to the skies. I remember too." 

" She did n t like her as a woman ; she praised 
her as an actress." 

" I thought you said she was n t an actress 
then," Nick rejoined. 

Peter hesitated. "Oh, Biddy thought so. She 
has seen her since, moreover. I too,; her the 
other night, and her curiosity s satisfied." 

"It s not of any consequence, and if there s a 



714  

reason for it I 11 bundle her off directly. But the 
great Miriam seems such a kind, good woman." 

"So she is, charming charming," said Peter, 
looking hard at Nick. 

" Here comes Biddy now," this young man went 
on. " I hear her at the door : you can warn her 
yourself." 

" It is n t a question of warning that s 
not in the least my idea. But I 11 take Biddy 
away," said Peter. 

" That will be still more energetic." 

" Oh, it s simply selfish I like her com 
pany." Peter had turned, as if to go to the door 
to meet the girl ; but he quickly checked him 
self, lingering in the middle of the room ; and the 
next instant Biddy had come in. When she saw 
him there she also stopped. 



XLIII. 

" ARRIVE, arrive, my child," said Nick. " Peter s 
weary of waiting for you." 

" Ah, he s come to say he won t dine with us 
to-night ! " Biddy stood with her hand on the 
latch. 

" I leave town to-morrow : I ve everything 
to do ; I m broken-hearted ; it s impossible," 
Peter pleaded. " Please make my peace with 
your mother; I m ashamed of not having written 
to her last night." 

Biddy closed the door and came in, while her 
brother said to her, " How in the world did you 
guess it ? " 

" 1 saw it in the Morning Post, " Biddy an 
swered, looking at Peter. 

"In the Morning Post ?" her cousin repeated. 

" I saw there s to be a first night at that thea 
tre, the one you took us to. So I said, Oh, he 11 
go there. " 

" Yes, I ve got to do that too," Peter ad 
mitted. 

" She s going to sit to me again this morning, 
the wonderful actress of that theatre she has 
made an appointment : so you see I m getting 
on," Nick announced to Biddy. 



716  

" Oh, 1 m so glad she s so splendid ! " The 
girl locked away from Peter now, but not, though 
it seemed to fill the place, at the triumphant por 
trait of Miriam Rooth. 

" I m delighted you ve come in. I have waited 
for you," Peter hastened to declare to Biddy, 
though he was conscious that this was, under the 
circumstances, meagre. 

" Are n t you coming to see us again ? " 

" I m in despair, but I shall really not have 
time. Therefore it s a blessing not to have missed 
you here." 

" I m very glad," said Biddy. Then she added : 
"And you re going to America to stay a long 
time?" 

"Till I m sent to some better place." 

" And will that better place be as far away ? " 

" Oh, Biddy, it would n t be better then," said 
Peter. 

" Do you mean they 11 give you something to 
do at home ? " 

" Hardly that. But I ve got a tremendous lot 
to do at home to-day." For the twentieth time 
Peter referred to his watch. 

Biddy turned to her brother, who murmured to 
her, "You might bid me good-morning." She 
kissed him, and he asked what the news might 
be in Calcutta Gardens ; to which she replied : 

"The only news is, of course, that, poor dears ! 
they re making great preparations for Peter. 
Mamma thinks you must have had such a nasty 



 717 

dinner the other day," the girl continued, to the 
guest of that romantic occasion. 

" Faithless Peter ! " said Nick, beginning to 
whistle and to arrange a canvas in anticipation 
of Miriam s arrival. 

" Dear Biddy, thank your stars you are not in 
my horrid profession," protested the personage 
thus designated. " One is bowled about like a 
cricket-ball, unable to answer for one s freedom 
or one s comfort from one moment to another." 

" Oh, ours is the true profession Biddy s 
and mine," Nick broke out, setting up his can 
vas : "the career of liberty and peace, of charm 
ing long mornings, spent in a still north light, 
in the contemplation, and I may even say in the 
company, of the amiable and the beautiful." 

" That certainly is the case when Biddy comes 
to see you," Peter returned. 

Biddy smiled at him. " I come every day. 
And? io son pittore ! I encourage Nick aw 
fully." 

" It s a pity I m not a martyr ; she would 
bravely perish with me," Nick said. 

"You are you are a martyr when people 
say such odious things ! " the girl cried. " They 
do say them. I ve heard many more than I ve 
repeated to you." 

" It s you yourself, then, indignant and sym 
pathetic, who are the martyr," observed Peter, 
who wanted greatly to be kind to her. 

" Oh, I don t care ! " she answered, coloring in 



718 THE TKAGIC MUSE. 

response to this ; and she continued, to Peter : 
" Don t you think one can do as much good by 
painting great works of art as by as by what 
papa used to do ? Don t you think art is necessary 
to the happiness, to the greatness of a people ? 
Don t you think it s manly and honorable ? Do 
you think a passion for it is a thing to be ashamed 
of? Don t you think the artist the conscien 
tious, the serious one is as distinguished a 
member of society as any one else ? " 

Peter and Nick looked at each other and 
laughed at the way she had got up her subject, 
and Nick asked his visitor if she did n t express 
it all in perfection. " I delight, in general, in art 
ists, but I delight still more in their defenders," 
Peter jested, to Biddy. 

" Ah, don t attack me, if you re wise," Nick 
said. 

" One is tempted to, when it makes Biddy so 
fine." 

" Well, that s the way she encourages me : 
it s meat and drink to me," Nick went on. " At 
the same time I m bound to say there is a little 
whistling in the dark in it." 

" In the dark ? " his sister demanded. 

"The obscurity, my dear child, of your own as 
pirations, your mysterious ambitions and plastic 
visions. Are n t there some heavyish shadows 
there ? " 

"Why, I never cared for politics." 

" No, but you cared for life, you cared for so- 



 

ciety, and you have chosen the path of solitude 
and concentration." 

" You horrid boy ! " said Biddy. 

" Give it up, that arduous steep give it up 
and come out with me," Peter interposed. 

" Come out with you ? " 

" Let us walk a little, or even drive a little. 
Let us at any rate talk a little." 

" I thought you had so much to do," Biddy 
candidly objected. 

" So I have, but why should n t you do a part 
of it with me ? Would there be any harm ? I m 
going to some tiresome shops you 11 cheer the 
economical hour." 

The girl hesitated ; then she turned to Nick. 
" Would there be any harm ? " 

" Oh, it s none of his business ! " Peter pro 
tested. 

"He had better take you home to your 
mother." 

"I m going home I sha n t stay here to 
day," said Biddy. Then, to Peter : " I came in a 
hansom, but I shall walk back. Come that way 
with me." 

" With singular pleasure. But I shall not be 
able to go in," Sherringham added. 

"Oh, that s no matter/ said Biddy. " Good- 
by, Nick." 

" You understand, then, that we dine together 
at seven sharp. Would n t a club be best ? " 
Peter, before going, inquired of Nick. He sug- 



72O  

gested further which club it should be ; and his 
words led Biddy, who had directed her steps 
toward the door, to turn a moment, as if she 
were on the point of asking reproachfully whether 
it was for this Peter had given up Calcutta Gar 
dens. But this impulse, if impulse it was, had 
no sequel except so far as it was a sequel that 
Peter spontaneously explained to her, after Nick 
had assented to his conditions, that her brother 
too had a desire to go to Miss Rooth s first night 
and had already promised to accompany him. 

" Oh, that s perfect ; it will be so good for 
him won t it? if he s going to paint her 
again," Biddy responded. 

" I think there s nothing so good for him as 
that he happens to have such a sister as you," 
Peter observed, as they went out. As he spoke 
he heard, outside, the sound of a carriage stop 
ping; and before Biddy, who was in front of him, 
opened the door of the house he had time to say 
to himself, "What a bore there s Miriam!" 
The opened door showed him that he was right 
this young lady was in the act of alighting 
from the brougham provided by Basil Dash wood s 
thrifty zeal. Her mother followed her, and both 
the new visitors exclaimed and rejoiced, in their 
demonstrative way, as their eyes fell upon their 
valued friend. The door had closed behind Peter, 
but he instantly and violently rang, so that they 
should be admitted with as little delay as pos 
sible, while he remained slightly disconcerted by 



 72 1 

the prompt occurrence of an encounter he had 
sought to avert. It ministered, moreover, a little 
to this particular sensation that Miriam appeared 
to have come somewhat before her time. The inci 
dent promised, however, to pass off in the happiest 
way. Before he knew it both the ladies had taken 
possession of Biddy, who looked at them with 
comparative coldness, tempered indeed by a faint 
glow of apprehension, and Miriam had broken out: 

" We know you, we know you ; we saw you in 
Paris, and you came to my theatre a short time 
ago with Mr. Sherringham." 

" We know your mother, Lady Agnes Dormer. 
I hope her ladyship is very well," said Mrs. 
Rooth, who had never struck Sherringham as a 
more objectionable old woman. 

" You offered to do a head of me, or something 
or other : did n t you tell me you work in clay ? 
I dare say you ve forgotten all about it, but I 
should be delighted," Miriam pursued, with the 
richest urbanity. 

Peter was not concerned with her mother s 
pervasiveness, though he did n t like Biddy to see 
even that ; but he hoped his companion would 
take the overcharged benevolence of the young 
actress in the spirit in which, rather to his sur 
prise, it evidently was offered. 

" I ve sat to your clever brother many times," 
said Miriam; "I m going to sit again. I dare 
say you ve seen what we ve done he s too 
delightful. Si vous saviez comme cela me re- 



722  

pose ! " she added, turning for a moment to 
Sherringham. Then she continued, smiling, to 
Biddy : " Only he ought n t to have thrown up 
such prospects, you know. I have an idea I 
wasn t nice to you that day in Paris I was 
nervous and scared and perverse. I remember 
perfectly ; I was odious. But I m better now 
you d see if you were to know me. I m not a 
bad girl really I m not. But you must have 
your own friends. Happy they you look so 
charming ! Immensely like Mr. Dormer, espe 
cially about the eyes ; is n t she, mamma ? " 

" She comes of a beautiful Norman race the 
finest, purest strain," the old woman simpered. 
" Mr. Dormer is sometimes so good as to come 
and see us we are always at home on Sunday ; 
and if some day you were so venturesome as to 
come with him you might perhaps find it pleasant, 
though very different, of course, from the circle 
in which you habitually move." 

Biddy murmured a vague recognition of these 
wonderful civilities, and Miriam commented : 
"Different, yes; but we re all right, you know. 
Do come," she added. Then turning to Sher 
ringham, " Remember what I told you I don t 
expect you to-night." 

" Oh, I understand ; I shall come," Peter an 
swered, growing red. 

" It will be idiotic. Keep him, keep him away 
don t let him," Miriam went on, to Biddy; 
with which, as Nick s portals now were gaping, 
she drew her mother away. 



 

Peter, at this, walked off briskly with Biddy, 
dropping, as he did so, " She s too fantastic ! " 

" Yes, but so tremendously good-looking. I 
shall ask Nick to take me there," the girl con 
tinued, after a moment. 

" Well, she 11 do you no harm. They re all 
right, as she says. It s the world of art you 
were standing up so for art, just now." 

" Oh, I was n t thinking so much of that kind," 
said Biddy. 

"There s only one kind it s all the same 
thing. If one sort s good the other is." 

Biddy walked along a moment. "Is she seri 
ous ? Is she conscientious ? " 

" Oh, she has the makings of a great artist," 
said Peter. 
f " I m glad to hear you think a woman can be 

one." 

. " In that line there has never been any doubt 
\about it." 

\ " And only in that line ? " 
I " I mean on the stage in general, dramatic or 
lyric. It s as the actress that the woman pro 
duces the most complete and satisfactory artistic 
results." 

" And only as the actress ? " 

" Yes, there s another art in which she s not 
bad." 

" Which one do you mean ? " asked Bidc ? y. 

" That of being charming and good, and indis 
pensable to man." 



;i 



724  

"Oh, that isn t an art." 

" Then you leave her only the stage. Take it, 
if you like, in the widest sense." 

Biddy appeared to reflect a moment, as if to 
see in what sense this might be. But she found 
none that was wide enough, for she cried the 
next minute : " Do you mean to say there s 
nothing for a woman but to be an actress ? " 

" Never in my life. I only say that that s the 
best thing for a woman to be who finds herself 
irresistibly carried into the practice of the arts ; 
for there her capacity for them has most applica 
tion and her incapacity for them least. But at 
the same time I strongly recommend her not to 
be an artist if she can possibly help it. It s a 
devil of a life." 

" Oh, I know ; men want women not to be any 
thing." 

" It s a poor little refuge they try to take from 
the overwhelming consciousness that you are, in 
fact, everything." 

" Everything ? That s the kind of thing you 
say to keep us quiet." 

" Dear Biddy, you see how well we succeed ! " 
laughed Sherringham ; to which the girl re 
sponded by inquiring irrelevantly : 

" Why is it so necessary for you to go to the 
theatre to-night, if Miss Rooth does n t want you 
to ? " 

" My dear child, she does. But that has no 
thing to do with it." 



 725 

" Why then did she say that she does n t ? " 
" Oh, because she meant just the contrary." 
" Is she so false, then is she so vulgar ? " 
" She speaks a special language ; practically it 
is n t false, because it renders her thought, and 
those who know her understand it." 

" But she does n t use it only to those who 
know her, since she asked me, who have so little 
the honor of her acquaintance, to keep you away 
to-night. How am I to know that she meant by 
that that I m to urge you on to go ? " 

Sherringham was on the point of replying, 
" Because you have my word for it ; " but he 
shrank, in fact, from giving his word he had 
some fine scruples and endeavored to get out of 
his embarrassment by a general tribute. " Dear 
Biddy, you re delightfully acute : you re quite as 
clever as Miss Rooth." He felt, however, that 
this was scarcely adequate, and he continued : 
" The truth is, its being important for me to go 
is a matter quite independent of that young lady s 
wishing it or not wishing it. There happens to 
be a definite, intrinsic propriety in it which de 
termines the matter, and which it would take me 
long to explain." 

" I see. But fancy your explaining to me : 
you make me feel so indiscreet ! " the girl cried 
quickly an exclamation which touched him 
because he was not aware that, quick a it had 
been, Biddy had still had time to be struck first 
(though she would n t for the world have ex- 



726  

pressed it) with the oddity of such a duty at such 
a time. In fact, that oddity, during a silence of 
some minutes, came back to Peter himself: the 
note had been forced it sounded almost ignobly 
frivolous, for a man on the eve of proceeding to 
a high diplomatic post. The effect of this, how 
ever, was not to make him break out with : 
" Hang it, I ivill keep my engagement to your 
mother!" but to fill him with the wish that he 
could shorten his actual excursion by taking 
Biddy the rest of the way in a cab. He was 
uncomfortable, and there were hansoms about 
which he looked at wistfully. While he was so 
occupied his companion took up the talk by an 
abrupt interrogation. 

" Why did she say that Nick ought n t to have 
resigned his seat ? " 

" Oh, I don t know ; it struck her so. It 
doesn t matter much." 

" If she s an artist herself why does n t she 
like people to go in for art, especially when Nick 
has given his time to painting her so beautifully ? 
Why does she come there so often, if she disap 
proves of what he has done ? " 

"Oh, Miriam s disapproval it doesn t count; 
it s a manner of speaking." 

" Of speaking untruths, do you mean ? Does 
she think just the reverse is that the way she 
talks about everything ? " 

" We always admire most what we can do 
least," Peter replied ; and Miriam of course is n t 



 72 / 

political. She ranks painters more or less with 
her own profession, about which, already, new as 
she is to it, she has no illusions. They re all 
artists ; it s the same general sort of thing. She 
prefers men of the world men of action." 

" Is that the reason she likes you ? " Biddy 
mocked. 

" Ah, she does n t like me could n t you see 
it ? " 

Biddy said nothing for a moment ; then she 
asked : " Is that why she lets you call her Mir 
iam ? " 

"Oh, I don t, to her face." 

" Ah, only to mine ! " laughed Biddy. 

" One says that as one says Rachel of her 
great predecessor." 

" Except that she is n t so great, quite yet, is 
she ? " 

" Far from it ; she s the freshest of novices 
she has scarcely been four months on the stage. 
But no novice has ever been such an adept. 
She 11 go very fast, and I dare say that before 
long she ll be magnificent." 

" What a pity you 11 not see that ! " Biddy re 
marked, after a short interval. 

"Not see it?" 

" If you re thousands of miles away." 

" It is a pity," Peter said ; " and since you men 
tion it I don t mind frankly telling you throw 
ing myself on your mercy, as it were that 
that s why I make such a point of a rare occa- 



728  

sion like to-night. I ve a weakness for the drama 
that, as you perhaps know, I ve never concealed, 
and this impression will probably have to last me, 
in some barren spot, for many, many years." 

" I understand I understand. I hope, there 
fore, it will be charming." And Biddy walked 
faster. 

"Just as some other charming impressions will 
have to last," Peter added, conscious of a certain 
effort that he was obliged to make to keep up 
with her. She seemed almost to be running 
away from him, a circumstance which led him to 
suggest, after they had proceeded a little further 
without more words, that if she were in a hurry 
they had perhaps better take a cab. Her face 
was strange and touching to him as she turned 
it to reply quickly : 

" Oh, I m not in the least in a hurry, and I 
think, really, I had better walk." 

"We ll walk, then, by all means!" Peter de 
clared, with slightly exaggerated gayety ; in pur 
suance of which they went on a hundred yards. 
Biddy kept the same pace ; yet it was scarcely a 
surprise to Sherringham that she should suddenly 
stop, with the exclamation : 

" After all, though I m not in a hurry I m 
tired ! I had better have a cab ; please call that 
one," she added, looking about her. 

They were in a straight, blank, ugly street, 
where the small, cheap, gray -faced houses had no 
expression save that of a rueful inconsolable con- 



 729 

sciousness of its want of identity. They would 
have constituted a " terrace " if they could, but 
they had given it up. Even a hansom which 
loitered across the end of the vista turned a skep 
tical back upon it, so that Sherringham had to 
lift his voice in a loud appeal. He stood with 
Biddy watching the cab approach them. " This 
is one of the charming things you 11 remember," 
she said, turning her eyes to the general dreari 
ness from the particular figure of the vehicle, 
which was antiquated and clumsy. Before he 
could reply she had lightly stepped into the cab ; 
but as he answered, " Most assuredly it is," and 
prepared to follow her, she quickly closed the 
apron. 

" I must go alone ; you Ve lots of things to do 
it s all right;" and, through the aperture in 
the roof, she gave the driver her address. She 
had spoken with decision, and Peter recognized 
that she wished to get away from him. Her eyes 
betrayed it, as well as her voice, in a look not 
a hard one, however which as he stood there 
with his hand on the cab he had time to take 
from her. " Good-by, Peter," she smiled ; and 
as the cab began to rumble away he uttered the 
same tepid, ridiculous farewell. 



XLIV. 

WHEN Miriam and her mother went into the 
studio Nick Dormer had stopped whistling, but 
he was still gay enough to receive them with 
every demonstration of sociability. He thought 
his studio a poor place, ungarnished, un tapestried, 
a bare, almost grim workshop, with all its revela 
tions and honors still to come. But both his vis 
itors smiled upon it a good deal in the same way 
in which they had smiled on Bridget Dormer 
when they met her at the door : Mrs. Rooth be 
cause vague, prudent approbation was the habit 
of her foolish little face it was ever the least 
danger ; and Miriam because apparently she was 
genuinely glad to find herself within the walls 
which she spoke of now as her asylum. She 
broke out in this strain to her host almost as soon 
as she had crossed the threshold, commending his 
circumstances, his conditions of work, as infinitely 
happier than her own. He was quiet, indepen 
dent, absolute, free to do what he liked as he 
liked it, shut up in his little temple with his altar 
and his divinity ; not hustled about in a mob ot 
people, having to posture and grin to pit and gal 
lery, to square himself at every step with insuf 
ferable conventions and with the ignorance and 
vanity of others. He was blissfully alone. 



, 73! 

" Mercy, how you do abuse your fine profes 
sion ! I m sure I never urged you to adopt it ! " 
Mrs. Rooth cried, in real bewilderment, to her 
daughter. 

" She was abusing mine still more, the other 
day," joked Nick "telling me I ought to be 
ashamed of it and of myself." 

" Oh, I never know from one moment to the 
other I live with my heart in my mouth," 
sighed the old woman. 

" Are n t you quiet about the great thing 
about my behavior ? " Miriam smiled. " My only 
extravagances are intellectual." 

" I don t know what you call your behavior." 

" You would very soon, if it were not what it 
is." 

" And I don t know what you call intellectual," 
grumbled Mrs. Rooth. 

" Yes, but I don t see very well how I could 
make you understand that. At any rate," Mir 
iam went on, looking at Nick, "I retract what I 
said the other day about Mr. Dormer. I Ve no 
wish to quarrel with him about the way he has 
determined to dispose of his life, because after all 
it does suit me very well. It rests me, this little 
devoted corner ; oh, it rests me. It s out of the 
tussle and the heat, it s deliciously still, and they 
can t get at me. Ah, when art s like this, a la 
bonne hcnre ! " And she looked round on such a 
presentment of " art " with a splendid air that 
made Nick burst out laughing at its contrast with 



732  

the humble fact. Miriam smiled at him as if she 
liked to be the cause of his mirth, and went on 
appealing to him : " You 11 always let me come 
here for an hour, won t you, to take breath to 
let the whirlwind pass ? You need n t trouble 
yourself about me ; I don t mean to impose on 
you in the least the necessity of painting me, 
though if that s a manner of helping you to get 
on you may be sure it will always be open to you. 
Do what you like with me in that respect ; only 
let me sit here on a high stool, keeping well out 
of your way, and see what you happen to be do 
ing. I 11 tell you my own adventures when you 
want to hear them." 

"The fewer adventures you have to tell, the 
better, my dear," said Mrs. Rooth ; " and if Mr. 
Dormer keeps you quiet he will add ten years to 
my life." 

"This is an interesting comment on Mr. Dor 
mer s own quietus, on his independence and 
sweet solitude," Nick observed. " Miss Rooth 
has to work with others, which is, after all, only 
what Mr. Dormer has to do when he works with 
Miss Rooth. What do you make of the inevita 
ble sitter ? " 

"Oh," answered Miriam, "you can say to the 
sitter, * Hold your tongue, you brute ! : 

" Is n t it a good deal in that manner that I ve 
heard you address your comrades at the theatre ? " 
asked Mrs. Rooth. "That s why my heart s in 
my mouth." 



 733 

" Yes, but they hit me back ; they reply to me 
comme de raison as I should never think of 
replying to Mr. Dormer. It s a great advantage 
to him that when he s peremptory with his model 
it only makes her better, adds to her expression 
of gloomy grandeur." 

" We did the gloomy grandeur in the other pic 
ture : suppose, therefore, we try something dif 
ferent in this," suggested Nick. 

" It is serious, it is grand," murmured Mrs. 
Rooth, who had taken up a rapt attitude before 
the portrait of her daughter. " It makes one 
wonder what she s thinking of. Beautiful, com 
mendable things that s what it seems to say." 

"What can I be thinking of but the tremen 
dous wisdom of my mother ? " Miriam inquired. 
" I brought her this morning to see that thing 
she had only seen it in its earliest stage and 
not to presume to advise you about anything else 
you may be so good as to embark on. She 
wanted, or she professed that she wanted, terribly 
to know what you had finally arrived at. She 
was too impatient to wait till you should send it 
home." 

" Ah, send it home send it home ; let us 
have it always with us !" Mrs. Rooth urged. "It 
will hold us up ; it will keep us on the heights, 
near the stars be always, for us, a symbol and 
a reminder ! " 

" You see I was right," Miriam went on ; " for 
she appreciates thoroughly, in her own way, and 



734  

understands. But if she worries or distracts you 
I 11 send her directly home I ve kept the car 
riage there on purpose. I must add that I don t 
feel quite safe to-day in letting her out of my 
sight. She is liable to make dashes at the thea 
tre and play unconscionable tricks there. I shall 
never again accuse mamma of a want of interest 
in my profession. Her interest to-day exceeds 
even my own. She s all over the place, and she 
has ideas ; ah, but ideas ! She s capable of turn 
ing up at the theatre at five o clock this afternoon 
and demanding that the scenery of the third act 
be repainted. For myself, I Ve not a word more 
to say on the subject I ve accepted the situa 
tion. Everything is no doubt wrong ; but nothing 
can possibly be right. Let us eat and drink, for 
to-night we die. If you like, mamma shall go 
and sit in the carriage, and as there is no means 
of fastening the doors (is there ?) your servant 
shall keep guard over her." 

"Just as you are now be so good as to re 
main so; sitting just that way leaning back, 
with a smile in your eyes and one hand on the 
sofa beside you, supporting you a little. I shall 
stick a flower into the other hand let it lie in 
your lap, just as it is. Keep that thing on your 
head it s admirably uncovered : do you call the 
construction a bonnet? and let your head fall 
back a little. There it is it s found. This 
time I shall really do something, and it will be as 
different as you like from that crazy job. Pazi- 



 735 

enza ! " It was in these irrelevant but earnest 
words that Nick responded to his sitter s uttered 
vagaries, of which her charming tone ard counte 
nance diminished the superficial acerbity. He 
held up his hands a moment, to fix her in her 
limits, and a few minutes afterwards had a happy 
sense of having begun to work. 

"The smile in her eyes don t forget the 
smile in her eyes ! " Mrs. Rooth exclaimed softly, 
turning away and creeping about the room. 
" That will make it so different from the other 
picture and show the two sides of her genius, 
with the wonderful range between them. It will 
be a magnificent pendant ; and though I dare 
say I shall strike you as greedy, you must let 
me hope you will send it home too." 

Mrs. Rooth explored the place discreetly, on 
tiptoe, gossiping as she went and bending her 
head and her eyeglass over various objects with 
an air of imperfect comprehension which did not 
prevent Nick from being reminded of the story 
of her underhand commercial habits told by Ga 
briel Nash at the exhibition in Paris, the first 
time her name had fallen on his ear. A queer 
old woman from whom, if you approached her in 
the right way, you could buy old pots it was 
in this character that she had originally been in 
troduced to him. He had lost sight of it after 
wards, but it revived again as his observant eyes, 
at the same time that they followed his active 
hand, became aware of her instinctive appraising 



736  

gestures. There was a moment when he laughed 
out gayly there was so little in his poor studio 
to appraise. Mrs. Rooth s vague, polite, disap 
pointed bent back and head made a subject, the 
subject of a sketch, in an instant : they gave 
such a sudden pictorial glimpse of the element 
of race. He found himself seeing the immemo 
rial Jewess in her, holding up a candle in a 
crammed back-shop. There was no candle, in 
deed, and his studio was not crammed, and it 
had never occurred to him before that she was 
of Hebrew strain, except on the general theory, 
held with -pertinacity by several clever people, 
that most of us are more or less so. The late 
Rudolf Roth had been, and his daughter was vis 
ibly her father s child ; so that, flanked by such 
a pair, good Semitic reasons were surely not 
wanting to the mother. Receiving Miriam s lit 
tle satiric shower without shaking her shoulders, 
she might at any rate have been the descendant 
of a tribe long persecuted. Her blandness was 
imperturbable, and she professed that she would 
be as still as a mouse. Miriam, on the other side 
of the room, in the tranquil beauty of her atti 
tude (it was " found " indeed, as Nick had said), 
watched her a little and then exclaimed that she 
wished she had locked her up at home. Putting 
aside her humorous account of the dangers to 
which she was exposed from her mother, it was 
not whimsical to imagine that, within the limits 
of that repose from which the Neville-Nugents 



 737 

never wholly departed, Mrs. Rooth might indeed 
be a trifle fidgety and have something on her 
mind. Nick presently mentioned that it would 
not be possible for him to " send home " this 
second performance ; and he added, in the exu 
berance of having already got a little into rela 
tion with his work, that perhaps that did n t mat 
ter, inasmuch as if Miriam would give him his 
time, to say nothing of her own a third master 
piece might also, some day, very well come off. 
His model rose to this without conditions, assur 
ing him that he might count upon her till she 
grew too old and too ugly, and that nothing 
would make her so happy as that he should paint 
her as often as Romney had painted the cele 
brated Lady Hamilton. " Ah, Lady Hamilton ! " 
deprecated Mrs. Rooth ; while Miriam, who had 
on occasion the candor of a fine acquisitiveness, 
inquired what particular reason there might be 
for his not letting them have the picture he was 
now beginning. 

" Why, I ve promised it to Peter Sherringham 
he has offered me money for it," Nick replied. 
" However, he s welcome to it for nothing, poor 
fellow, and I shall be delighted to do the best I 
can for him." 

Mrs. Rooth, still prowling, stopped in the mid 
dle of the room at this, and Miriam exclaimed : 
" He offered you money just as we came in ? " 

" You met him, then, at the door, with my sis 
ter ? I supposed you had he s taking her 
home," said Nick. 



738 THE TKAGIC MUSE. 

" Your sister s a lovely girl such an aristo 
cratic type ! " breathed Mrs. Rooth. Then she 
added : " I ve a tremendous confession to make 
to you." 

" Mamma s confessions have to be tremendous 
to correspond with her crimes," said Miriam. 
" She asked Miss Dormer to come and see us 
suggested even that you might bring her some 
Sunday. I don t like the way mamma does such 
things too much humility, too many simagrees, 
after all ; but I also said what I could to be nice 
to her. Your sister is charming awfully pretty 
and modest. If you were to press me I should 
tell you frankly that it seems to me rather a 
social muddle, this rubbing shoulders of nice 
girls and filles de theatre: I shouldn t think it 
would do your young ladies much good. How 
ever, it s their own affair, and no doubt there s 
no more need of their thinking we re worse than 
we are than of their thinking we re better. The 
people they live with don t seem to know the dif 
ference I sometimes make my reflections about 
the public one works for." 

" Ah, if you go in for the public s knowing dif 
ferences, you re far too particular," Nick laughed. 
" D oii tombcz-vons ? as you affected French peo 
ple say. If you have anything at stake on that, 
you had simply better not play." 

" Dear Mr. Dormer, don t encourage her to be 
so dreadful ; for it is dreadful, the way she talks," 
Mrs. Rooth broke in. " One would think we 



 739 

were not respectable one would think I had 
never known what I have known and been what 
I have been." 

" What one would think, beloved mother, is 
that you are a still greater humbug than you are. 
It s you, on the contrary, that go down on your 
knees, that pour forth apologies about our being 
vagabonds." 

" Vagabonds listen to her ! after the edu 
cation I ve given her and our magnificent pros- / 
pects ! " wailed Mrs. Rooth, sinking, with clasped 
hands, upon the nearest ottoman. 

" Not after our prospects, if prospects they 
are : a good deal before them. Yes, you ve 
taught me tongues, and I m greatly obliged to 
you they no doubt impart variety, as well as 
incoherency, to my conversation ; and that of 
people in our line is for the most part notoriously 
monotonous and shoppy. The gift of tongues is, 
in general, the sign of your genuine adventurer. 
Dear mamma, I ve no low standard that s the 
last thing," Miriam went on. " My weakness is 
my exalted conception of respectability. Ah, 
parlez-moi de qa and of the way I understand it ! 
Oh, if I were to go in for being respectable you d 
see something fine. I m awfully conservative 
and I know what respectability is, even when I 
meet people of society on the accidental middle . 
ground of glowering or smirking. I know also 
what it isn t it isn t the sweet union of little 
girls and actresses. I should carry it much fur- 



740  

ther than any of these people : I should never 
look at the likes of us ! Every hour I live I 
see that the wisdom of the ages was in the ex 
perience of dear old Madame Carre was in a 
hundred things she told me. She s founded on a 
rock. After that," Miriam went on, to her host, 
" I can assure you that if you were so good as to 
bring Miss Dormer to see us we should be an 
gelically careful of her and surround her with 
every attention and precaution." 

" The likes of us the likes of us ! " Mrs. 
Rooth repeated plaintively, with ineffectual, the 
oretical resentment. " I don t know what you are 
talking about, and I decline to be turned upside 
down. I have my ideas as well as you, and I 
repudiate the charge of false humility. I ve been 
through too many troubles to be proud, and a plea 
sant, polite manner was the rule of my life even 
in the days when, God knows, I had everything. 
I ve never changed, and if with God s help I 
had a civil tongue then, I have a civil tongue now. 
It s more than you always have, my poor per 
verse and passionate child. Once a lady always a 
lady all the footlights in the world, turn them 
up as high as you will, won t make a difference. 
And I think people know it, people who know 
anything (if I may use such an expression), and 
it s because they know it that I m not afraid to 
address them courteously. And I must say 
and I call Mr. Dormer to witness, for if he could 
reason with you a bit about it he might render 



 741 

several people a service your conduct to Mr. 
Sherringham simply breaks my heart," Mrs. 
Rooth concluded, with a jump of several steps 
in the fine modern avenue of her argument. 

Nick was appealed to, but he hesitated a mo 
ment, and while he hesitated Miriam remarked, 
" Mother s good mother s very good ; but it is 
only little by little that you discover how good 
she is." This seemed to leave Nick free to ask 
Mrs. Rooth, with the preliminary intimation that 
what she had just said was very striking, what 
she meant by her daughter s conduct to Peter 
Sherringham. Before Mrs. Rooth could answer 
this question, however, Miriam interposed, irrele 
vantly, with one of her own. "Do you mind tell 
ing me if you made your sister go off with Mr. 
Sherringham because you knew it was about time 
for me to turn up ? Poor Mr. Dormer, I get you 
into trouble, don t I ? " she added sympatheti 
cally. 

" Into trouble ? " echoed Nick, looking at her 
head but not at her eyes. 

" Well, we won t talk about that ! " Miriam ex 
claimed, with a rich laugh. 

Nick now hastened to say that he had nothing 
to do with his sister s leaving the studio she 
had only come, as it happened, for a moment. 
She had walked away with Peter Sherringham 
because they were cousins and old friends : he 
was to leave England immediately, for a long 
time, and he had offered her his company going 



742  

home. Mrs. Rooth shook her head very know 
ingly over the "long time" that Mr. Sherring- 
ham would be absent she plainly had her ideas 
about that ; and she conscientiously related that 
in the course of the short conversation they had 
all had at the door of the house her daughter 
had reminded Miss Dormer of something that 
had passed between them, in Paris, in regard to 
the charming young lady s modeling her head. 

" I did it to make the question of our meeting 
less absurd to put it on the footing of our both 
being artists. I don t ask you if she has talent," 
said Miriam. 

" Then I need n t tell you," answered Nick. 

"I m sure she has talent and a very refined 
inspiration. I see something in that corner, cov 
ered with a mysterious veil," Mrs. Rooth insinu 
ated ; which led Miriam to ask immediately : 

" Has she been trying her hand at Mr. Sher- 
ringham ? " 

"When should she try her hand, poor dear 
young lady ? He s always sitting with us," said 
Mrs. Rooth. 

" Dear mamma, you exaggerate. He has his 
moments, when he seems to say his prayers to 
me ; but we ve had some success in cutting them 
down. R sest bien detach^ ces-jours-ci, and I m 
very happy for him. Of course it s an imperti 
nent allusion for me to make ; but I should be so 
delighted if I could think of him as a little in love 
with Miss Dormer," the girl pursued, addressing 
Nick. 



 743 

" He is, I think, just a little just a tiny bit," 
said Nick, working away ; while Mrs. Rooth ejac 
ulated, to her daughter, simultaneously : 

" How can you ask such fantastic questions 
when you know that he s dying for you ? " 

" Oh, dying ! he s dying very hard ! " cried 
Miriam. "Mr. Sherringham s a man of whom I 
can t speak with too much esteem and affection, 
who may be destined to perish by some horrid 
fever (which God forbid !) in the unpleasant coun 
try he s going to. But he won t have caught his 
fever from your humble servant" 

" You may kill him even while you remain in 
perfect health yourself," said Nick; "and since 
we re talking of the matter I don t see the harm 
in my confessing that he strikes me as bad oh, 
as very bad indeed." 

" And yet he s in love with your sister ? je 
fiy suis plus" 

"He tries to be, for he sees that as regards you 
there are difficulties. He would like to put his 
hand on some nice girl who would be an antidote 
to his poison." 

" Difficulties are a mild name for them ; poison, 
even, is a mild name for the ill he suffers from. 
The principal difficulty is that he does n t know 
what he wants. The next is that I don t either 
or what I want myself. I only know what T 
don t want," said Miriam brightly, as if she were 
uttering some happy, beneficent truth. " I don t 
want a person who takes things even less simply 



744  

than I do myself. Mr. Sherringham, poor man, 
must be very uncomfortable, for one side of him 
is perpetually fighting against the other side. 
He s trying to serve God and Mammon, and I 
don t know how God will come off. What I like 
in you is that you have definitely let Mammon go 
it s the only way. That s my earnest convic 
tion, and yet they call us people light. Poor Mr. 
Sherringham has tremendous ambitions tre 
mendous riguardi, as we used to say in Italy. 
He wants to enjoy every comfort and to save 
every appearance, and all without making a sacri 
fice. He expects others me, for instance to 
make all the sacrifices. Merci, much as I esteem 
him and much as I owe him ! I don t know how 
he ever came to stray, at all, into our bold, bad 
Bohemia : it was a cruel trick for fortune to play 
him. He can t keep out of it, he s perpetually 
making dashes across the border, and yet he s 
not in the least at home there. There s another 
in whose position (if I were in it) I would n t look 
at the likes of us ! " 

" I don t know much about the matter, but I 
have an idea Peter thinks he has made, or at least 
is making, sacrifices." 

" So much the better you must encourage 
him, you must help him." 

" I don t know what my daughter s talking 
about she is much too clever for me," Mrs. 
Rooth put in. " But there s one way you can 
encourage Mr. Sherringham there s one way 



 745 

you can help him ; and perhaps it won t make it 
any worse for a gentleman of your good nature 
that it will help me at the same time. Can t I 
look to you, dear Mr. Dormer, to see that he does 
come to the theatre to-night that he doesn t 
feel himself obliged to stay away ?" 

" What danger is there of his staying away ? " 
Nick asked. 

" If he s bent on sacrifices, that s a very good 
one to begin with," Miriam observed. 

" That s the mad, bad way she talks to him 
she has forbidden the dear unhappy gentleman 
the house ! " her mother cried. " She brought it 
up to him just now, at the door, before Miss Dor 
mer : such very odd form ! She pretends to im 
pose her commands upon him." 

" Oh, he 11 be there we re going to dine to 
gether," said Nick. And when Miriam asked 
him what that had to do with it he went on : 
" Why, we ve arranged it ; I m going, and he 
won t let me go alone." 

" You re going ? I sent you no places," Mir 
iam objected. 

" Yes, but I ve got one. Why did n t you, 
after all I ve done for you ? " 

She hesitated a moment. " Because I m so 
good. No matter," she added : " if Mr. Sherring- 
ham comes I won t act." 

" Won t you act for me ? " 

" She 11 act like an angel," Mrs. Rooth pro 
tested. " She might do, she might be, any- 



746  

thing in the world ; but she won t take common 
pains." 

" Of one thing there s no doubt," said Miriam : 
"that compared with the rest of us poor pas 
sionless creatures mamma does know what she 
wants." 

"And what is that?" inquired Nick, chalking 
away. 

" She wants everything." 

" Never, never I m much more humble," re 
torted the old woman ; upon which her daughter 
requested her to give then to Mr. Dormer, v\ho 
was a reasonable man and an excellent judge, a 
general idea of the scope of her desires. 

As, however, Mrs. Rooth, sighing and depre 
cating, was not quick to comply with the injunc 
tion, the girl attempted a short cut to the truth 
with the abrupt inquiry : " Do you believe for a 
single moment he d marry me ? " 

" Why, he has proposed to you you ve told 
me, yourself a dozen times." 

" Proposed what to me ? I ve told you that 
neither a dozen times nor once, because I ve 
never understood. He has made wonderful 
speeches, but he has never been serious." 

" You told me he had been in the seventh 
heaven of devotion, especially that night we went 
to the foyer of the Francois," Mrs. Rooth in 
sisted. 

" Do you call the seventh heaven of devotion 
serious ? He s in love with me, je le veux bien ; 



7 HE TRAGIC MUSE. 747 

he s so poisoned, as Mr. Dormer vividly says, as 
to require an antidote ; but he has never spoken 
to me as if he really expected me to listen to 
him, and he s the more of a gentleman from that 
fact. He knows we have n t a common ground 
that a grasshopper can t mate with a fish. So 
he has taken care to say to me only more than 
he can possibly mean. That makes it just no 
thing." 

" Did he say more than he -can possibly mean 
when he took formal leave of you yesterday 
forever and ever ? " 

" Pray don t you call that a sacrifice ? " Nick 
asked. 

" Oh, he took it all back, his sacrifice, before 
he left the house." 

"Then has that no meaning ?" demanded Mrs. 
Rooth. 

"None that I can make out." 

" Oh, I ve no patience with you : you can be 
stupid when you will as well as clever when you 
will ! " the old woman groaned. 

"What mamma wishes me to understand and 
to practice is the particular way to be clever 
with Mr. Sherringham," said Miriam. " There 
are doubtless depths of wisdom and virtue in it. 
But I can see only one way ; namely, to be per 
fectly honest." 

" I like to hear you talk it makes you live, 
brings you out," Nick mentioned. "And you 
sit beautifully still. All 1 want to say is, please 



748  

continue to do so ; remain exactly as you are 
it s rather important for the next ten min 
utes." 

"We re washing our dirty linen before you, 
but it s all right," Miriam answered, "because 
it shows you what sort of people we are, and 
that s what you need to know. Don t make me 
vague and arranged and fine, in this new thing," 
she continued : " make me characteristic and 
real ; make life, "with all its horrid facts and 
truths, stick out of me. I wish you could put 
mother in too ; make us live there side by side 
and tell our little story. The wonderful actress 
and her still more wonderful mamma don t 
you think that s an awfully good subject? " 

Mrs. Rooth, at this, cried shame on her daugh 
ter s wanton humors, professing that she herself 
would never accept so much from Nick s good 
nature, and Miriam settled it that, at any rate, he 
was some day and in some way to do her mother 
and sail very near the wind. 

" She does n t believe he wants to marry me, 
any more than you do," the girl, taking up her 
dispute again after a moment, represented to 
Nick ; " but she believes how indeed can I 
tell you what she believes ? that I can work it 
(that s about it), so that in the fullness of time I 
shall hold him in a vise. I m to keep him along 
for the present, but not to listen to him, for if I 
listen to him I shall lose him. It s ingenious, 
it s complicated ; but I dare say you follow me." 



 749 

" Don t move don t move," said Nick. " Ex 
cuse a beginner." 

" No, I shall explain quietly. Somehow (here 
it s very complicated and you must n t lose the 
thread), I shall be an actress and make a tremen 
dous lot of money, and somehow, too (I suppose 
a little later), I shall become an ambassadress and 
be the favorite of courts. So you see it will all 
be delightful. Only I shall have to go straight. 
Mamma reminds me of a story I once heard 
about the mother of a young lady who was in re 
ceipt of much civility from the pretender to a 
crown, which indeed he, and the young lady too, 
afterwards more or less wore. The old countess 
watched the course of events and gave her 
daughter the cleverest advice : Tiens bon, ma 
fille, and you shall sit upon a throne. Mamma 
wishes me to tenir bon (she apparently thinks 
there s a danger I may not), so that if I don t 
sit upon a throne I shall at least parade at the 
foot of one. And if before that, for ten years, I 
pile up the money, they ll forgive me the way 
I Ve made it. I should hope so, if I ve tenu 
bon ! Only, ten years is a good while to hold 
out, is n t it ? If it is n t Mr. Sherringham it 
will be some one else. Mr. Sherringham has 
the great merit of being a bird in the hand. I m 
to keep him along, I m to be still more diplo 
matic than even he can be." 

Mrs. Rooth listened to her daughter with an 
air of assumed reprobation which melted, before 



750  

the girl had done, into a diverted, complacent 
smile the gratification of finding herself the 
proprietress of so much wit and irony and grace. 
Miriam s account of her mother s views was a 
scene of comedy, and there was instinctive art 
in the way she added touch to touch and made 
point upon point. She was so quiet, to oblige 
her painter, that only her fine lips moved all 
her expression was in their charming utterance. 
Mrs. Rooth, after the first flutter of a less cynical 
spirit, consented to be sacrificed to an effect of 
an order she had now been educated to recog 
nize ; so that she hesitated only for a moment, 
when Miriam had ceased speaking, before she 
broke out, endearingly, with a little titter and 
"Comedienne!" She looked at Nick Dormer as 
if to say : " Ain t she fascinating ? That s the 
way she does for you ! " 

"It s rather cruel, isn t it," said Miriam, "to 
deprive people of the luxury of calling one an 
actress as they d call one a liar ? I represent, 
but I represent truly." 

"Mr. Sherringham would marry you to-morrow 
there s no question of ten years!" cried Mrs. 
Rooth, with a comicality of plainness. 

Miriam smiled at Nick, appealing for a sort of 
pity for her mother. "Isn t it droll, the way 
she can t get it out of her head ? " Then, turn 
ing, almost coaxingly, to the old woman, " Voy- 
ons, look about you : they don t marry us like 
that." 



 751 

" But they do cela se voit tons les jours. Ask 
Mr. Dormer." 

"Oh, never!" said Miriam: "it would be as 
if I asked him to give us a practical illustra 
tion." 

" I shall never give any illustration of matri 
mony ; for me that question s over," said Nick. 

Miriam rested kind eyes on him. "Dear me, 
how you must hate me ! " And before he had 
time to reply she went on, to her mother : " Peo 
ple marry them to make them leave the stage ; 
which proves exactly what I say." 

"Ah, they offer them the finest positions," 
reasoned Mrs. Rooth. 

" Do you want me to leave it, then ? " 

" Oh, you can manage, if you will ! " 

" The only managing I know anything about 
is to do my work. If I manage that, I shall pull 
through." 

"But, dearest, may our work not be of many 
sorts ? " 

"I only know one," said Miriam. 

At this Mrs. Rooth got up with a sigh. " I 
see you do wish to drive me into the street." 

" Mamma s bewildered there are so many 
paths she wants to follow, there are so many bun- 
dies of hay. As I told you, she wishes to gob 
ble them all," Miriam went on. Then she added : 
" Yes, go and take the carriage ; take a turn 
round the Park you always delight in that 
and come back for me in an hour." 



752  

" I m too vexed with you ; the air will do me 
good," said Mrs. Rooth. But before she went 
she added, to Nick : " I have your assurance that 
you will bring him, then, to-night ? " 

" Bring Peter ? I don t think I shall have to 
drag him," said Nick. "But you must do me 
the justice to remember that if I should resort to 
force I should do something that s not particu 
larly in my interest I should be magnanimous." 

" We must always be that, must n t we ? " mor 
alized Mrs. Rooth. 

" How could it affect your interest ? " Miriam 
inquired, less abstractly, of Nick. 

" Yes, as you say," her mother reminded him, 
" the question of marriage has ceased to exist for 
you."" 

" Mamma goes straight at it ! " laughed the 
girl, getting up, while Nick rubbed his canvas 
before answering. Miriam went to Mrs. Rooth 
and settled her bonnet and mantle in preparation 
for her drive ; then stood for a moment with a 
filial arm about her, as if they were waiting for 
their host s explanation. This, however, when it 
came, halted visibly. 

" Why, you said awhile ago that if Peter was 
there you would n t act." 

" I 11 act for him" smiled Miriam, encircling 
her mother. 

" It does n t matter whom it s for ! " Mrs. 
Rooth declared sagaciously. 

" Take your drive ana relax your mind," said 



 753 

the girl, kissing her. " Come for me in an hour ; 
not later, but not sooner." She went with her 
to the door, bundled her out, closed it behind her 
and came back to the position she had quitted. 
" This is the peace I want ! " she exclaimed, with 
relief, as she settled into it. 



XLV. 

PETER SHERRINGHAM said so little during the 
performance that his companion was struck by 
his dumbness, especially as Miriam s acting 
seemed to Nick Dormer magnificent. He held 
his breath while she was on the stage she gave 
the whole thing, including the spectator s emo 
tion, such a lift. She had not carried out her 
fantastic menace of not exerting herself, and, as 
Mrs. Rooth had said, it little mattered for whom 
she acted. Nick was conscious, as he watched 
her, that she went through it all for herself, for 
the idea that possessed her and that she rendered 
with extraordinary breadth. She could not open 
the door a part of the way to it and let it simply 
peep in ; if it entered at all it must enter in full 
procession and occupy the premises in state. 

This was what had happened on an occasion 
which, as Nick noted in his stall, grew larger with 
each throb of the responsive house ; till by the 
time the play was half over it appeared to stretch 
out wide arms to the future. Nick had often 
heard more applause, but he had never heard 
more attention ; for they were all charmed and 
hushed together and success seemed to be sitting 
down with them. There had been, of course, 



 755 

plenty of announcement the newspapers had 
abounded and the arts of the manager had taken 
the freest license ; but it was easy to feel a fine 
universal consensus and to recognize the intrinsic 
buoyancy of the evening. People snatched their 
eyes from the stage for an instant, to look at each 
other, and a sense of intelligence deepened and 
spread. It was a part of the impression that the 
actress was only now really showing, for this time 
she had verse to deal with and she made it un 
expectedly exquisite. She was beauty, she was 
music, she was truth ; she was passion and per 
suasion and tenderness. She caught up the ob 
streperous play in soothing, entwining arms and 
carried it into the high places of poetry, of style. 
And she had such tones of nature, such conceal 
ments of art, such effusions of life, that the whole 
scene glowed with the color she communicated, 
and the house, as if pervaded with rosy fire, 
glowed back at the scene. Nick looked round in 
the intervals ; he felt excited and flushed the 
night had turned into a feast of fraternity and he 
expected to see people embrace each other. The 
crowd, the flutter, the triumph, the surprise, the 
signals and rumors, the heated air, his associates, 
near him, pointing out other figures, who pre 
sumably were celebrated but whom he had never 
heard of, all amused him and banished every im 
pulse of criticism. Miriam was as satisfactory 
as some right sensation she would feed the 
memory with the ineffaceable. 



756  

One of the things that amused Nick, or at least 
helped to fill his attention, was Peter s attitude, 
which apparently did not exclude criticism ; rather 
indeed mainly implied it. Sherringham never 
took his eyes off the actress, but he made no re 
mark about her and he never stirred out of his 
chair. Nick had, from the first, a plan of going 
round to speak to her, but as his companion evi 
dently meant not to move he had a delicacy in 
regard to being more forward. During their brief 
dinner together (they made a rigid point of not 
being late), Peter had been silent and irremedi 
ably serious, but also, his kinsman judged, full of 
the wish to make it plain that he was calm. In 
his seat he was calmer than ever ; had an air even 
of trying to suggest to Nick that his attendance, 
preoccupied as he was with deeper solemnities, 
was slightly mechanical, the result of a concep 
tion of duty, a habit of courtesy. When, during 
a scene in the second act a scene from which 
Miriam was absent Nick observed to him that, 
from his inexpressiveness, one might gather he 
was not pleased, he replied after a moment : " I Ve 
been looking for her mistakes." And when Nick 
rejoined to this that he certainly wouldn t find 
them, he said again, in an odd tone : " No, I 
sha n t find them I sha n t find them." It 
might have seemed that since the girl s perform 
ance was a dazzling success he regarded his even 
ing as rather a failure. 

After the third act Nick said candidly : " M 







 757 

dear fellow, how can you sit here ? Are n t you 
going to speak to her ? " 

To which Peter replied inscrutably : " Lord, 
no, never again ; I bade her good-by yesterday. 
She knows what I think of her form. It s very 
good, but she carries it a little too far. Besides, 
she didn t want me to come, and it s therefore 
more discreet to keep away from her." 

" Surely it is n t an hour for discretion ! " cried 
Nick. " Excuse me, at any rate, for five min 
utes." 

He went behind and reappeared only as the 
curtain was rising on the fourth act ; and in the 
interval between the fourth and the fifth he went 
again for a shorter time. Peter was personally 
detached, but he consented to listen to his com 
panion s vivid account of the state of things on 
the stage, where the elation of victory had made 
every one merry. The strain was over, the ship 
was in port, and they were all wiping their faces 
and grinning. Miriam yes, positively was 
grinning too, and she had n t asked a question 
about Peter nor sent him a message. They were 
kissing all round and dancing for joy. They 
were on the eve, worse luck, of a tremendous 
run. Peter groaned, irrepressibly, at this ; it 
was, save for a slight manifestation a moment 
later, the only sign of emotion that Nick s report 
elicited from him. There was but one voice of 
regret that they had n t put on the piece earlier, 
as the end of the season would interrupt the run. 



758  

There was but one voice, too, about the fourth 
act it was believed that all London would rush 
to see the fourth act. There was a wonderful lot 
of people, and Miriam was charming ; she was 
receiving there, in the ugly place, like a kind of 
royalty, with a smile and a word for each. She 
was like a young queen on her accession. When 
she saw him, Nick, she had kissed her hand to 
him, over the heads of the courtiers. Nick s art 
less comment on this was that she had such 
pretty manners. It made Sherringham laugh, 
apparently at his companion s conception of the 
manners of a young queen. Mrs. Rooth, with a 
dozen shawls on her arm, was as red as a turkey ; 
but you couldn t tell whether Miriam was red 
or pale : she was so cleverly, awfully cleverly, 
painted perhaps a little too much. Dashwood, 
of course, was greatly to the fore, but you did n t 
have to mention his own performance to him : 
he was magnanimous and would use nothing but 
the feminine pronoun. He didn t say much, 
indeed, but he evidently had ideas ; he nodded 
significant things and whistled inimitable sounds 
" Heuh, heuh ! " He was perfectly satisfied ; 
moreover he looked further ahead than any 
one. 

It was on coming back to his place after the 
fourth act that Nick put in, for Sherringham s 
benefit, most of these touches in his sketch of the 
situation. If Peter had continued to look for 
Miriam s mistakes he had not yet found them : 



 759 

the fourth act, bristling with dangers, putting 
a premium on every sort of cheap effect, had 
rounded itself without a flaw. Sitting there 
alone, while Nick was away, he had leisure to 
meditate on the wonder of this on the art with 
which the girl had separated passion from vio 
lence, filling the whole place and never scream 
ing ; for it had seemed to him, in London, some 
times, of old, that the yell of theatrical emotion 
rang through the shrinking night like a fatal 
warning. Miriam had never been more present 
to him than at this hour ; but she was inextrica 
bly transmuted present essentially as the ro 
mantic heroine she represented. His state of 
mind was of the strangest, and he was conscious 
of its strangeness ; just as he was conscious, in 
his person, of a cessation of resistance which 
identified itself absurdly with liberation. He 
felt weak at the same time that he felt excited, 
and he felt excited at the same time that he 
knew, or believed he knew, that his face was a 
blank. He saw things as a shining confusion, 
and yet somehow something monstrously definite 
kept surging out of them. Miriam was a beauti 
ful, actual, fictive, impossible young woman, of 
a past age and undiscoverable country, who 
spoke in blank verse and overflowed with meta 
phor, who was exalted and heroic beyond all hu 
man convenience, and who yet was irre sistibly 
real and related to one s own affairs. But that 
reality was a part of her spectator s joy. and she 



760  

was not changed back to the common by his per 
ception of the magnificent trick of art with which 
it was connected. Before Nick Dormer rejoined 
him Sherringham, taking a visiting-card from his 
pocket, wrote on it in pencil a few words in a 
foreign tongue ; but as at that moment he saw 
Nick coming in he immediately put it out of 
view. 

The last thing before the curtain rose on the 
fifth act Nick mentioned that he had brought 
him a message from Basil Dashwood, who hoped 
they both, on leaving the theatre, would come to 
supper with him, in company with Miriam and 
her mother and several others : he had prepared 
a little informal banquet in honor of so famous 
a night. At this, while the curtain was rising, 
Peter immediately took out his card again and 
added something he wrote the finest small 
hand you could see. Nick asked him what he 
was doing, and after an hesitation he replied : 

" It s a word to say I. can t come." 

"To Dashwood ? Oh, I shall go," said Nick. 

"Well, I hope you ll enjoy it ! " his compan 
ion replied, in a tone which came back to him 
afterwards. 

When the curtain fell on the last act, the peo 
ple stayed, standing up in their places for the 
most part. The applause shook the house the 
recall became a clamor, the relief from a long 
tension. This was a moment, in any perform 
ance, that Sherringham detested, but he stood 



 /6l 

for an instant beside Nick, who clapped like a 
school-boy. There was a veritable roar, and the 
curtain drew back at the side most removed from 
them. Sherringham could see that Basil Dash- 
wood was holding it, making a passage for the 
male "juvenile lead," who had Miriam in tow. 
Nick redoubled his efforts ; heard the plaudits 
swell ; saw the bows of the leading gentleman, 
who was hot and fat ; saw Miriam, personally 
conducted and closer to the footlights, grow 
brighter and bigger and more swaying ; and then 
became aware that Sherringham had, with ex 
treme agility, slipped out of the stalls. Nick 
had already lost sight of him he had appar 
ently taken but a minute to escape from the 
house. Nick wondered at his quitting him with 
out a farewell, if he was to leave England on the 
morrow and they were not to meet at the hospi 
table Dashwood s. He wondered even what Peter 
was " up to," since, as he had assured him, there 
was no question of his going round to Miriam. 
He waited to see this young lady reappear three 
times, dragging Dashwood behind her at the 
second with a friendly arm, to whom, in turn, 
was hooked Miss Fanny Rover, the actress en 
trusted, in the piece, with the inevitable comic 
relief. He went out slowly, with the crowd, 
and at the door looked again for Peter, who 
struck him as deficient for once in finish. He 
could n t know that, in another direction and 
while he was helping the house to " rise " at 



762  

Miriam, his kinsman had been particularly ex 
plicit. 

On reaching the lobby Sherringham had 
pounced upon a small boy in buttons, who ap 
peared to be superfluously connected with a deso 
late refreshment-room and was peeping, on tip 
toe, at the stage, through the glazed hole in the 
door of a box. Into one of the child s hands he 
thrust the card he had drawn again from his 
waistcoat, and into the other the largest silver 
coin he could find in the same receptacle, while 
he bent over him with words of adjuration 
words which the little page tried to help himself 
to apprehend by instantly attempting to peruse 
the other words written on the card. 

" That s no use it s Italian," said Peter ; 
" only carry it round to Miss Rooth, without a 
minute s delay. Place it in her hand and she 11 
give you some object a bracelet, a glove or a 
flower to bring me back as a sign that she has 
received it. I shall be outside ; bring me there 
what she gives you, and you shall have another 
shilling only fly ! " 

Sherringham s small messenger sounded, him 
a moment with the sharp face of London wage 
earning, and still more of London tip-earning, 
infancy, and vanished as swiftly as a slave of the 
Arabian Nights. While his patron waited in the 
lobby the audience began to pour out, and before 
the urchin had come back to him Peter was 
clapped on the shoulder by Nick Dormer. 



 763 

"I m glad I haven t lost you," said Nick; 
" but why did n t you stay to give her a hand ? " 

" Give her a hand ? I hated it" 

" My dear fellow, I don t follow you," Nick 
rejoined. " If you won t come to Dashwood s 
supper I fear our ways don t lie together." 

" Thank him very much ; say I have to get 
up at an unnatural hour." To this Peter added, 
" I think I ought to tell you she may not be 
there." 

" Miss Rooth ? Why, it s for her." 

" I m waiting for a word from her she may 
change her mind." 

Nick stared at his companion. " For you ? 
Why, what have you proposed ? " 

" I ve proposed marriage," said Peter, in a 
strange voice. 

"I say ! " Nick broke out; and at the same 
moment Peter s messenger squeezed through the 
press and stood before him. 

" She has given me nothing, sir," the boy 
announced ; " but she says I m to say All 
right ! " 

Nick marveled a moment. ." You ve proposed 
through him f" 

"Ay, and she accepts. Good-night ! " Peter 
exclaimed ; and, turning away, he bounded into 
a hansom. He said something to the driver 
through the roof, and Nick s eyes followed the 
cab as it started off. Nick was mystified, was 
even amused ; especially when the youth in but- 



764  

tons, planted there and wondering too, remarked 
to him : 

" Please, sir, he told me he d give me a shil 
ling, and he ve forgot it." 

" Oh, I can t pay you for that ! " Nick laughed. 
He was vexed about the supper. 



XLVI. 

PETER SHERRINGHAM rolled away through the 
summer night to St. John s Wood. He had put 
the pressure of strong words upon Miriam, en 
treating her to drive home immediately, without 
any one, without even her mother. He wished 
to see her alone, for a purpose that he would fully 
and satisfactorily explain could n t she trust 
him ? He implored her to remember his own 
situation and throw over her supper, throw over 
everything. He would wait for her, with un 
speakable impatience, in Balaklava Place. 

He did so, when he got there, but it took half 
an hour. Interminable seemed his lonely vigil in 
Miss Lumley s drawing-room, where the char 
acter of the original proprietress came out to 
him, more than before, in a kind of afterglow of 
old sociabilities, a vulgar ghostly vibration. The 
numerous candles had been lighted for him, and 
Mrs. Rooth s familiar fictions were lying about ; 
but his nerves forbade him the solace of taking 
a chair and a book. He walked up and down, 
thinking and listening, and as the long window, 
the balmy air permitting, stood open into the gar 
den, he passed several times in and out. A car 
riage appeared to stop at the gate then there 



766  

was nothing ; he heard the rare rattle of wheels 
and the far-off hum of London. His impatience" 
was unreasonable, and though he knew this it 
persisted ; it would have been no easy matter for 
Miriam to break away from the flock of her felici- 
tators. Still less simple was it doubtless for her 
to leave poor Dashwood with his supper on his 
hands. Perhaps she would bring Dashwood with 
her, to time her ; she was capable of playing him 
- that is, playing Sherringham or even play 
ing them both, that trick. Perhaps the little 
wretch in buttons (Peter remembered now the 
neglected shilling) had only pretended to go 
round with his card, had come back with an in 
vented answer. But how could he know, since, 
presumably, he could n t read Italian, that his an 
swer would fit the message ? Peter was sorry 
now that he himself had not gone round, not 
snatched Miriam bodily away, made sure of her 
and of what he wanted of her. 

When half an hour had elapsed he regarded 
it as proved that she would n t come, and, asking 
himself what he should do, determined to drive 
off again and seize her at Basil Dashwood s feast. 
Then he remembered Nick had mentioned that 
this entertainment was not to be held at the 
young actor s lodgings, but at some tavern or 
restaurant, the name of which he had not heeded. 
Suddenly, however, Sherringham became aware 
with joy that this name did n t matter, for there 
was something at the garden-door at last. He 



 767 

rushed out before Miriam had had time to ring, 
and saw, as she stepped out of the carriage, that 
she was alone. Now that she was there, that he 
had this evidence she had listened to him and 
trusted him, all his impatience and exasperation 
melted away and a flood of pleading tenderness 
came out in the first words he spoke to her. It 
was far "dearer" of her than he had any right 
to dream, but she was the best and kindest crea 
ture this showed it as well as the most won 
derful. He was really not off his head with his 
contradictory ways ; no, before heaven he was n t, 
and he would explain, he would make everything 
clear. Everything was changed. 

Miriam stopped short, in the little dusky gar 
den, looking at him in the light of the open win 
dow. Then she called back to the coachman 
they had left the garden-door open : " Wait for 
me, mind ; I shall want you again." 

"What s the matter won t you stay ?" Peter 
asked. " Are you going out again at this absurd 
hour ? I won t hurt you," he urged gently. And 
he went back and closed the garden-door. He 
wanted to say to the coachman : " It s no mat 
ter ; please drive away." At the same time he 
would n t for the world have done anything offen 
sive to Miriam. 

" I ve come because I thought it better to 
night, as things have turned out, to do the thing 
you ask me, whatever it may be. That s prob 
ably what you calculated I would think, eh ? 



7 68 ThE TRAGIC MUSE. 

What this evening has been you ve seen, and I 
must allow that your hand s in it. That you 
know for yourself that you doubtless felt as 
you sat there. But I confess I don t imagine 
what you want of me here, now," Miriam added. 
She had remained standing in the path. 

Peter felt the irony of her " now," and how it 
made a fool of him, but he had been prepared for 
it and for much worse. He had begged her not 
to think him a fool, but in truth, at present, he 
cared little if she did. Very likely he was, in 
spite of his plea that everything was changed 
he cared little even himself. However, he spoke 
in the tone of intense reason and of the fullest 
disposition to satisfy her. This lucidity only took 
still more from the dignity of his tergiversation : 
his separation from her the day before had had 
such pretensions to being lucid. But the expla 
nation, the justification, were in the very fact, 
and the fact had complete possession of him. He 
named it when he replied to Miriam : " I ve 
simply overrated my strength." 

" Oh, I knew I knew ! That s why I en 
treated you not to come ! " she groaned. She 
turned away impatiently, and for a moment he 
thought she would retreat to her carriage. But 
he passed his hand into her arm, to draw her for 
ward, and after an instant he felt her yield. 

"The fact is we must have this thing out," 
he said. Then he added, as he made her go into 
the house, bending over her, " The failure of 



 769 

my strength that was just the reason of my 
coming." 

She burst out laughing at these words, as she 
entered the drawing-room, and her laugh made 
them sound pompous in their false wisdom. She 
flung off, as a good-natured tribute to the image 
of their having the thing out, a white shawl that 
had been wrapped round her. She was still 
painted and bedizened, in the splendid dress of 
her fifth act, so that she seemed protected and 
alienated by the character she had been repre 
senting. " Whatever it is you want (when I un 
derstand), you 11 be very brief, won t you ? Do 
you know I ve given up a charming supper for 
you ? Mamma has gone there. I ve promised 
to go back to them." 

" You re an angel not to have let her come 
with you. I m sure she wanted to," said Sher- 
ringham. 

" Oh, she s all right, but she s nervous," Mir 
iam rejoined. Then she added quickly : " Could 
n t she keep you away, after all ? " 

" Whom are you talking about ? " Biddy Dor-. 
mer was as absent from Sherringham s mind as 
if she had never existed. 

" The charming girl you were with this morn 
ing. Is she so afraid of obliging me ? Oh, she d 
be so good for you ! " 

" Don t speak of that," said Peter, gravely. " I 
was in perfect good faith yesterday when I took 
leave of you. I was I was. But I can t I 
can t : you are too unutterably dear to me." 



7/0  

"Oh, don t please don t," moaned Miriam. 
She stood before the fireless chimney-piece with 
one of her hands upon it. " If it s only to say 
that, don t you know, what s the use ? " 

" It is n t only to say that. I ve a plan, a per 
fect plan : the whole thing lies clear before me." 

"And what is the whole thing? " 

He hesitated a moment. " You say your mo 
ther s nervous. Ah, if you knew how nervous 
I am!" 

" Well, I m not Go on." 

"Give it up give it up!" stammered Sher- 
ringham. 

" Give it up ? " Miriam fixed him like a mild 
Medusa. 

" I 11 marry you to-morrow if you 11 renounce ; 
and in return for the sacrifice you make for me 
I 11 do more for you than ever was done for a 
woman before." 

" Renounce, after to-night ? Do you call that 
a plan?" asked Miriam. "Those are old words 
and very foolish ones : you wanted something of 
the sort a year ago." 

" Oh, I fluttered round the idea then ; we were 
talking in the air. I did n t really believe I could 
make you see it then, and certainly you did n t 
see it. My own future moreover was n t definite 
to me. I did n t know what I could offer you. 
But these last months have made a difference, 
and I do know now. Now what I say is deliber 
ate, it s deeply meditated. I simply can t live 






 7/1 

without you, and I hold that together we may do 
great things." 

" What sort of things ? " Miriam inquired. 

" The things of my profession of my life 
the things one does for one s country, the respon 
sibility and the honor of great affairs ; deeply fas 
cinating when one s immersed in them, and 
more -exciting than the excitements of the thea 
tre. Care for me only a little and you 11 see 
what they are, they 11 take hold of you. Believe 
me, believe me," Sherringham pleaded, " every 
fibre of my being trembles in what I say to you." 

" You admitted yesterday it would n t do," said 
Miriam. "Where were the fibres of your being 
then ? " 

" They trembled even more than now, and I 
was trying, like an ass, not to feel them. Where 
was this evening, yesterday where were the 
maddening hours I ve just spent ? Ah, you re 
the perfection of perfections, and as I sat there 
to-night you taught me what I really want." 

" The perfection of perfections ? " the girl re 
peated interrogatively, with the strangest smile. 

" I need n t try to tell you : you must have felt, 
to-night, with such rapture, what you are, what 
you can do. How can I give that up ? " Sher 
ringham asked. 

" How can /, my poor friend ? I like your 
plans and your responsibilities and your great af 
fairs, as you call them. Voyons, they re infantile. 
I ve just shown that I m a perfection of perfec- 



7/2  

tions : therefore it s just the moment to renounce, 
as you gracefully say ? Oh, I was sure, I was 
sure ! " And Miriam paused, resting solicitous, 
pitying eyes upon her visitor, as if she were try 
ing to think of some arrangement that would help 
him out of his absurdity. " I was sure, I mean, 
that if you did come, your poor dear doting brain 
would be quite addled," she presently went on. 
" I can t be a muff, in public, just for you, pour- 
tant. Dear me, why do you like us so much ? " 

" Like you ? I loathe you ! " 

" Je le vois parbleu bien ! I mean, why do you 
feel us, judge us, understand us so well ? I please 
you because you see, because you know ; and be 
cause I please you, you must adapt me to your 
convenience, you must take me over, as they say. 
You admire me as an artist, and therefore you 
wish to put me into a box in which the artist will 
breathe her last. Ah, be reasonable ; you must 
let her live ! " 

" Let her live ? As if I could prevent her liv 
ing ! " Peter cried, with unmistakable conviction. 
"Even if I wanted, how could I prevent a spirit 
like yours from expressing itself? Don t tall 
about my putting you in a box, for, dearest child, 
I m taking you out of one. The artist is irr&lt; 
pressible, eternal ; she 11 be in everything you an 
and in everything you do, and you 11 go about with 
her triumphantly exerting your powers, charm 
ing the world, carrying everything before you." 

Miriam s color rose, through her paint, at this , 






 773 

vivid picture, and she asked whimsically : " Shall 
you like that ? " 

" Like my wife to be the most brilliant woman 
in Europe? I think I can do with it." 

" Are n t you afraid of me ? " 

" Not a bit." 

" Bravely said. How little you know me, after 
all ! " sighed the girl. 

"I tell the truth," Peter went on ; "and you 
must dome the justice to admit that I have taken 
the time to dig deep into my feelings. I m not 
an infatuated boy ; I ve lived, I Ve had experi 
ence, I ve observed; in short I know what I m 
about: It is n t a thing to reason about ; it s 
simply a need that consumes me. I ve put it on 
starvation diet, but it s no use really, it s no 
use, Miriam," poor Sherringham pursued, with a 
soft quaver that betrayed all his sincerity. " It 
is n t a question of my trusting you ; it s simply a 
question of your trusting me. You re all right, 
as I ve heard you say yourself ; you re frank, 
spontaneous, generous; you re a magnificent 
creature. Just quietly marry me, and I 11 man 
age you." 

" Manage me ? " The girl s inflection was 
droll ; it made Sherringham change color. 

" I mean I 11 give you a larger life than the 
largest you can get in any other way. The stage 
is great, no doubt, but the world is greater. It s 
a bigger theatre than any of those places in 
the Strand. We ll go in for realities instead of 



774  

fables, and you 11 do them far better than you do 
the fables." 

Miriam had listened to him attentively, but 
her face showed her despair at his perverted in 
genuity. " Excuse me for saying so, after your 
delightful tributes to my worth," she returned, in 
a moment, "but I ve never listened to such a 
flood of determined sophistry. You think so well 
of me that humility itself ought to keep me si 
lent ; nevertheless, I must utter a few shabby 
words of sense. I m a magnificent creature on 
the stage well and good; it s what I want to 
be, and it s charming to see such evidence that 
I succeed. But off the stage come, come; I 
should lose all my advantages. The fact is so 
patent that it seems to me I m very good-natured 
even to discuss it with you." 

" Are you on the stage now, pray ? Ah, Mir 
iam, if it were not for the respect I owe you ! " 
her companion murmured. 

" If it were not for that I should n t have come 
here to meet you. My talent is the thing that 
takes you: could there be a better proof than 
that it s to-night s exhibition of it that has settled 
you ? It s indeed a misfortune that you re so 
sensitive to this particular kind of talent, since it 
plays such tricks with your power to see things 
as they are. Without it I should be a dull, igno 
rant, third-rate woman, and yet that s the fate 
you ask me to face and insanely pretend you are 
ready to face yourself." 



 775 

" Without it without it ? " Sherringham 
cried. " Your own sophistry is infinitely worse 
than mine. I should like to see you without it 
for the fiftieth part of a second. What I ask 
you to give up is the dusty boards of the play 
house and the flaring footlights, but not the very 
essence of your being. Your talent is yourself, 
and it s because it s yourself that I yearn for 
you. If it had been a thing you could leave be 
hind by the easy dodge of stepping off the stage 
I would never have looked at you a second time. 
Don t talk to me as if I were a simpleton, with 
your false simplifications ! You were made to 
charm and console, to represent beauty and har 
mony and variety to miserable human beings ; 
and the daily life of man is the theatre for that 

- not a vulgar shop with a turnstile, that s open 
only once in the twenty-four hours. Without it, 
verily ! " Sherringham went on, with rising scorn 
and exasperated passion. " Please let me know 
the first time you re without your face, without 
your voice, your step, your exquisite spirit, the 
turn of your head and the wonder of your eye ! " 
Miriam, at this, moved away from him with a 
port that resembled what she sometimes showed 
on the stage when she turned her young back 
upon the footlights and then, after a few steps, 
grandly swept round again. This evolution she 
performed (it was over in an instant) on the 
present occasion ; even to stopping short with 

her eyes upon him and her head erect. " Surely 



776  

it s strange," she said, "the way the other solu 

tion never occurs to you." 
" The other solution ? " 
"That you should stay on the stage." 
" I don t understand you," Sherringham con 

fessed. 

" Stay on my stage ; come off your own." 
Sherringham hesitated a moment. " You mean 

that if I 11 do that you 11 have me ? " 

" I mean that if it were to occur to you to offer 

me a little sacrifice on your own side, it might 

place the matter in a slightly more attractive 



" Continue to let you act as my wife ? " Sher 
ringham demanded. " Is it a real condition ? 
Am I to understand that those are your terms ? " 

" I may say so without fear, because you 11 
never accept them." 

" Would you accept them, from me accept 
the sacrifice, see me throw up my work, my pros 
pects (of course I should have to do that), and 
simply become your appendage ? " 

" My dear fellow, you invite me with the best 
conscience in the world to become yours." 

" The cases are not equal. You would make 
of me the husband of an actress. I should make 
of you the wife of an ambassador." 

" The husband of an actress, cest bientot dit, 
in that tone of scorn ! If you re consistent," 
said Miriam, " it ought to be a proud position for 
you." 






 7/7 

" What do you mean, if I m consistent ? " 
" Have n t you always insisted on the beauty 
and interest of our art and the greatness of our 
mission ? Have n t you almost come to blows 
with poor Gabriel Nash about it ? What did all 
that mean if you won t face the first conse 
quences of your theory ? Either it was an en 
lightened conviction or it was an empty pretense. 
If it was heartless humbug I m glad to know it," 
Miriam rolled out, with a darkening eye. " The 
better the cause, it seems to me, the better the 
deed ; and if the theatre is important to the hu 
man spirit, as you used to say so charmingly, 
and if, into the bargain, you have the pull of be 
ing so fond of me, I don t see why it should be 
monstrous to give us your services, in an intelli 
gent indirect way. Of course if you re not seri 
ous we need n t talk at all ; but if you are, with 
your conception of what the actor can do, why 
is it so base to come to the actor s aid, taking 
one devotion with another? If I m so fine I m 
worth looking after a bit, and the place where 
I m finest is the place to look after me ! " 

" You were never finer than at this minute, in 
the deepest domesticity of private life," Sher- 
ringham returned. " I have no conception what 
ever of what the actor can do, and no theory 
whatever about the importance of the theatre. 
Any infatuation of that sort has completely quit 
ted me, and for all I care the theatre may go to 
the dogs." 



778  

" You re dishonest, you re ungrateful, you re 
false ! " Miriam flashed. " It was the theatre 
that brought you here ; if it had n t been for the 
theatre I never would have looked at you. It 
was in the name of the theatre you first made 
love to me ; it is to the theatre that you owe 
every advantage that, so far as I m concerned, 
you possess." 

" I seem to possess a great many ! " groaned 
Sherringham. 

" You might certainly make more of those you 
have ! You make me angry, but I want to be 
fair," said the glowing girl, "and I can t be un 
less you will. You are not fair, nor candid, nor 
honorable, when you swallow your words and ab 
jure your faith, when you throw over old friends 
and old memories for a selfish purpose." 

" Selfish purpose is, in your own convenient 
idiom, bientot dit" Sherringham answered. " I 
suppose you consider that if I truly esteemed 
you I should be ashamed to deprive the world of 
the light of your genius. Perhaps my esteem 
is n t of the right quality (there are different 
kinds, are n t there ?). At any rate I ve explained 
that I propose to deprive the world of nothing at 
all. You shall be celebrated, allez ! " 

" Rubbish rubbish ! " Miriam mocked, turn 
ing away again. " I know, of course," she added 
quickly, " that to befool yourself with such plati 
tudes you must be pretty bad." 

" Yes, I m pretty bad," Sherringham admitted, 



 779 

looking at her dismally. " What do you do with 
the declaration you made me the other day the 
day I found my cousin here that you d take 
me if I should come to you as one who had risen 
high ? " 

Miriam reflected a moment. " I remember 
the chaff about the orders, the stars and garters. 
My poor dear friend, don t be so painfully literal. 
Don t you know a joke when you see it ? It was 
to worry your cousin, was n t it ? But it did n t 
in the least succeed." 

"Why should you wish to worry my cousin ? " 

" Because he s so provoking. And surely I 
had my freedom no less than I have it now. 
Pray, what explanations should I have owed you 
and in what fear of you should I have gone ? 
However, that has nothing to do with it. Say I 
did tell you that we might arrange it on the day 
that you should come to me covered with glory 
in the shape of little tinkling medals : why should 
you anticipate that transaction by so many years 
and knock me down such a long time in advance ? 
Where is the glory, please, and where are the 
medals ? " 

" Dearest girl, am I not going to America (a 
capital promotion) next month," Sherringham 
argued, " and can t you trust me enough to be 
lieve that I speak with a real appreciation of the 
facts that I m not lying to you, in short 
when I tell you that I ve my foot in the stirrup ? 
The glory s dawning, / m all right, too." 



780  

" What you propose to me, then, is to accom 
pany you tout bonnement to your new post." 

" You put it in a nutshell," smiled Sherring- 
ham. 

" You re touching ; it has its charm. But you 
can t get anything in America, you know. I m 
assured there are no medals to be picked up 
there. That s why the diplomatic body hate 
it." 

"It s on the way it s on the way," Sher- 
ringham hammered, feverishly. " They don t 
keep us long in disagreeable places, unless we 
want to stay. There s one thing you can get 
anywhere if you re clever, and nowhere if you re 
not, and in the disagreeable places, generally, 
more than in the others : and that (since it s 
the element of the question we re discussing) is 
simply success. It s odious to be put on one s 
swagger, but I protest against being treated as 
if I had nothing to offer to offer to a person 
who has such glories of her own. I m not a little 
presumptuous ass ; I m a man accomplished and 
determined, and the omens are on my side." 
Peter faltered a moment, and then, with a queer 
expression, he went on : " Remember, after all, 
that, strictly speaking, your glories are also still 
in the future." An exclamation, at these words, 
burst from Miriam s lips, but her companion re 
sumed quickly : " Ask my official superiors, ask 
any of my colleagues, if they consider that I ve 
nothing to offer." 



 781 

Peter Sherringham had an idea, as he ceased 
speaking, that Miriam was on the point of break 
ing out with some strong word of resentment at 
his allusion to the contingent nature of her pros 
pects. But it only twisted the weapon in his 
wound to hear her saying with extraordinary 
mildness, " It s perfectly true that my glories 
are still to come, that I may fizzle out and that 
my little success of to-day is perhaps a mere flash 
in the pan. Stranger things have been some 
thing of that sort happens every day. But don t 
we talk too much of that part of it ? " she asked, 
with a weary tolerance that was noble in its ef 
fect. " Surely it s vulgar to consider only the 
noise one s going to make ; especially when one 
remembers how unintelligent nine tenths cf it 
will be. It is n t to my glories that I cling ; it s 
simply to my idea, even if it s destined to sink 
rne into obscurity. I like it better than any 
thing else a thousand times better (I m sorry 
to have to put it in such a way) than tossing up 
my head as the fine lady of a little coterie." 

"A little coterie ? I don t know what you re 
talking about ! " Peter retorted, with considerable 
heat. 

" A big coterie, then ! It s only that, at the 
best. A nasty, prim official woman, who is 
perched on her little local pedestal and thinks 
she s a queen forever because she s ridiculous 
for an hour ! Oh, you need n t tell me. I ve seen 
them abroad, I could imitate them here. I could 



782  

do one for you on the spot, if I were not so tired 
It s scarcely worth mentioning, perhaps, but I m 
ready to drop." Miriam picked up the white 
mantle she had tossed off, flinging it round her 
with her usual amplitude of gesture. " They re 
waiting for me, and I confess I m hungry. If I 
don t hurry they ll eat up all the nice things. 
Don t say I have n t been obliging, and come 
back when you re better. Good-night." 

" I quite agree with you that we ve talked too 
much about the vulgar side of our question," 
Peter responded, walking round to get between 
her and the French window by which she appar 
ently had a view of leaving the room. "That s 
because I ve wanted to bribe you. Bribery is 
almost always vulgar." 

"Yes, you should do better. Merci ! There s 
a cab : some of them have come for me. I must 
go," Miriam added, listening for a sound that 
reached her from the road. 

Sherringham listened too, making out no cab. 
" Believe me, it is n t wise to turn your back on 
such an affection as mine and on such a con 
fidence," he went on, speaking almost in a warn 
ing tone (there was a touch of superior sternness 
in it, as of a rebuke for real folly, but it was 
meant to be tender), arid stopping her within a 
few feet of the window. " Such things are the 
most precious that life has to give us," he added, 
all but didactically. 

Miriam had listened again for a moment ; then 



 783 

she appeared to give up the idea of the cab. The 
reader need hardly be told, at this stage of her 
youthful history, that the right way for her lover 
to soothe her was not to represent himself as act 
ing for her highest good. " I like your calling it 
confidence," she presently said ; and the deep 
note of the few words had something of the dis 
tant mutter of thunder. 

" What is it, then, when I offer you everything 
I am, everything I have, everything I shall 
achieve ? " 

She seemed to measure him for a moment, as 
if she were thinking whether she should try to 
pass him. But she remained where she was and 
she returned : " I m sorry for you, yes, but I m 
also rather ashamed of you." 

"Ashamed of me ? " 

" A brave offer to see me through that s 
what I should call confidence. You say to-day 
that you hate the theatre ; and do you know what 
has made you do it ? The fact that it has too 
large a place in your mind to let you repudiate it 
and throw it over with a good conscience. It has 
a deep fascination for you, and yet you re not 
strong enough to make the concession of taking 
up with it publicly, in my person. You re 
ashamed of yourself for that, as all your constant 
high claims for it are on record ; so you blas 
pheme against it, to try and cover your retreat 
and your treachery and straighten out your per 
sonal situation. But it won t do, my dear fellow 



784  

it won t do at all," Miriam proceeded, with a 
triumphant, almost judicial lucidity which made 
her companion stare ; " you have n t the smallest 
excuse of stupidity, and your perversity is no 
excuse at all. Leave her alone altogether a 
poor girl who s making her way or else come 
frankly to help her, to give her the benefit of 
your wisdom. Don t lock her up for life under 
the pretense of doing her good. What does one 
most good is to see a little honesty. You re the 
best judge, the best critic, the best observer, the 
best believer, that I ve ever come across ; you re 
committed to it by everything you ve said to me 
for a twelvemonth, by the whole turn of your 
mind, by the way you ve followed up this busi 
ness of ours. If an art is noble and beneficent, 
one should n t be afraid to offer it one s arm. 
Your cousin is n t : he can make sacrifices." 

" My cousin ? " shouted Peter. " Why, was n t 
it only the other day that you were throwing his 
sacrifices in his teeth ? " 

Under this imputation upon her consistency 
Miriam flinched but for an instant. " I did that 
to worry you" she smiled. 

" Why should you wish to worry me if you care 
so little about me ? " 

"Care little about you? Haven t I told you 
often, did n t I tell you yesterday, how much 
I care ? Ain t I showing it now by spending 
half the night here with you (giving myself away 
to all those cynics), taking all this trouble to per- 



 785 

suade you to hold up your head and have the 
courage of your opinions ?" 

" You invent my opinions for your conven 
ience," said Peter. " As long ago as the night I 
introduced you, in Paris, to Mademoiselle Voisin, 
you accused me of looking down on those who 
practice your art. I remember you almost 
scratched my eyes out because I didn t kotow 
enough to your friend Dashwood. Perhaps I 
did n t ; but if already at that time I was so wide 
of the mark, you can scarcely accuse me of 
treachery now." 

" I don t remember, but I dare say you re 
right," Miriam meditated. " What I accused 
you of then was probably simply what I reproach 
you with now : the germ, at least, of your deplor 
able weakness. You consider that we do aw 
fully valuable work, and yet you would n t for the 
world let people suppose that you really take our 
side. If your position was even at that time so 
false, so much the worse for you, that s all. Oh, 
it s refreshing," the girl exclaimed, after a pause 
during which Sherringhatn seemed to himself to 
taste the full bitterness of despair, so baffled and 
derided he felt " oh, it s refreshing to see a 
man burn his ships in a cause that appeals to 
him, give up something for it and break with hid 
eous timidities and snobberies ! It s the most 
beautiful sight in the world." 

Sherringham, sore as he was, and angry, and 
exasperated, nevertheless burst out laughing at 



7 86  

this. " You re magnificent, you give me at this 
moment the finest possible illustration of what 
you mean by burning one s ships. Verily, verily, 
there s no one like you : talk of timidity, talk of 
refreshment ! If I had any talent for it I d go 
on the stage to-morrow, to spend my life with 
you the better." 

"If you ll do that, I ll be your wife the day 
after your first appearance. That would be 
really respectable," said Miriam. 

" Unfortunately I Ve no talent." 

.That would only make it the more respect 
able." 

" You re just like Nick," Peter rejoined : 
"you ve taken to imitating Gabriel Nash. Don t 
you see that it s only if it were a question of my 
going on the stage myself that there would be a 
certain fitness in your contrasting me invidiously 
with Nick Dormer and in my giving up one ca 
reer for another ? But simply to stand in the 
wing and hold your shawl and your smelling-bot 
tle ! " Peter concluded mournfully, as if he had 
ceased to debate. 

" Holding my shawl and my smelling-bottle is 
a mere detail, representing a very small part of 
the various precious services, the protection and 
encouragement for which a woman in my position 
might be indebted to a man interested in her 
work and accomplished and determined, as you 
very justly describe yourself." 

" And would it be your idea that such a man 



 787 

should live on the money earned by an exhibition 
of the person of his still more accomplished and 
still more determined wife ? " 

" Why not, if they work together if there s 
something of his spirit and his support in every 
thing she does ? " Miriam demanded. "Je vous 
attendais, with the famous * person; of course 
that s the great stick they beat us with. Yes, 
we show it for money, those of us who have any 
thing to show, and some no doubt who have n t, 
which is the real scandal. What will you have ? 
It s only the envelope of the idea, it s only our 
machinery, which ought to be conceded to us ; 
and in proportion as the idea takes hold of us do 
we become unconscious of the clumsy body. 
Poor old person if you knew what we think 
of it ! If you don t forget it, that s your own 
affair : it shows that you re dense before the 
idea." 

" That I m dense ? " 

"I mean the public is the public who pays 
us. After all, they expect us to look at them 
too, who are not half so well worth it. If you 
should see some of the creatures who have the 
face to plant themselves there in the stalls before 
one, for three mortal hours ! I dare say it would 
be simpler to have no bodies, but we re all in the 
same box, and it would be a great injustice to 
the idea, and we re all showing ourselves, all the 
while ; only some of us are not worth paying." 

" You re extraordinarily droll, but somehow I 



788  

can t laugh at you," said Peter, his handsome 
face lengthened to a point that sufficiently at 
tested the fact. " Do you remember the second 
time I ever saw you the day you recited at my 
place ? " he abruptly inquired, a good deal as if 
he were drawing from his quiver an arrow which, 
if it was the last, was also one of the most 
pointed. 

" Perfectly, and what an idiot I was, though it 
was only yesterday ! " 

" You expressed to me then a deep detestation 
of the sort of self-exposure to which the profes 
sion you were seeking to enter would commit 
you. If you compared yourself to a contortion 
ist at a country fair I m only taking my cue from 
you." 

" I don t know what I may have said then," re 
plied Miriam, whose steady flight was not ar 
rested by this ineffectual bolt ; " I was, no doubt, 
already wonderful for talking of things I know 
nothing about. I was only on the brink of the 
stream and I perhaps thought the water colder 
than it is. One warms it a bit one s self, when 
once one is in. Of course I m a contortionist 
and of course there s a hateful side : but don t 
you see how that very fact puts a price on every 
compensation, on the help of those who are ready 
to insist on the other side, the grand one, and 
especially on the sympathy of the person who is 
ready to insist most and to keep before us the 
great thing, the element that makes up for every 
thing ? " 



 789 

" The element ? " Peter questioned with a 
vagueness which was pardonably exaggerated. 
" Do you mean your success ? " 

" I mean what you ve so often been eloquent 
about," the girl returned, with an indulgent 
shrug " the way we simply stir people s souls. 
Ah, there s where life can help us," she broke 
out, with a change of tone, " there s where hu 
man relations and affections can help us ; love 
and faith and joy and suffering and experience 
I don t know what to call em. They suggest 
things, they light them up and sanctify them, as 
you may say ; they make them appear worth do- 
"ing." She became radiant for a moment, as if 
with a splendid vision ; then melting into still 
another accent, which seemed all nature and har 
mony, she proceeded : "I must tell you that in 
the matter of what we can do for each other I 
have a tremendously high ideal. I go in for 
closeness of union, for identity of interest. A 
true marriage, as they call it, must do one a lot 
of good ! " 

Sherringham stood there looking at her a min 
ute, during which her eyes sustained the rum 
mage of his gaze without a relenting gleam of 
the sense of cruelty or of paradox. With a pas 
sionate but inarticulate ejaculation he turned 
away from her and remained, on the edge of the 
window, his hands in his pockets, gazing defeat- 
edly, doggedly, into the featureless night, into 
the little black garden which had nothing to give 



790  

him but a familiar smell of damp. The warm 
darkness had no relief for him, and Miriam s his 
trionic hardness flung him back against a fifth- 
rate world, against a bedimmed, star-punctured 
nature which had no consolation the bleared, 
irresponsive eyes of the London heaven. For 
the brief space that he glared at these things he 
dumbly and helplessly raged. What he wanted 
was something that was not in that thick pros 
pect. What was the meaning of this sudden 
offensive importunity of "art," this senseless 
mocking catch, like some irritating chorus of 
conspirators in a bad opera, in which Miriam s 
voice was so incongruously conjoined with Nick s 
and in which Biddy s sweet little pipe had not 
scrupled still more bewilderingly to mingle ? Art 
be damned : what commission, after all, had he 
ever given it to better him or bother him ? If 
the pointless groan in which Peter exhaled a part 
of his humiliation had been translated into words, 
these words would have been as heavily charged 
with the genuine British mistrust of the bother 
some principle as if the poor fellow speaking 
them had never quitted his island. Several ac 
quired perceptions had struck a deep root in him, 
but there was an immemorial compact formation 
which lay deeper still. He tried at the present 
hour to rest upon it spiritually, but found it in 
elastic ; and at the very moment when he was 
most conscious of this absence of the rebound or 
of any tolerable ease his vision was solicited by 



 7QI 

an object which, as he immediately guessed, 
could only add to the complication of things. 

An undefined shape hovered before him in 
the garden, half-way between the gate and the 
house ; it remained outside of the broad shaft of 
lamplight projected from the window. It wa 
vered for a moment, after it had become aware of 
Peter s observation, and then whisked round the 
corner of the little villa. This characteristic 
movement so effectually dispelled the mystery 
(it could only be Mrs. Rooth who resorted to 
such conspicuous secrecies) that, to feel that the 
game was up and his interview over, Sherringham 
had no need of seeing the figure reappear, on 
second thoughts, and dodge about in the dusk 
with a vexatious sportive imbecility. Evidently 
Miriam s warning of a few minutes before had 
been founded : a cab had deposited her anxious 
mother at the garden-door. Mrs. Rooth had en 
tered with precautions ; she had approached the 
house and retreated ; she had effaced herself 
had peered and waited and listened. Maternal 
solicitude and muddled calculations had drawn 
her away from a festival as yet only imperfectly 
commemorative. The heroine of the occasion, 
of course, had been intolerably missed, so that 
the old woman had both obliged the company 
and quieted her own nerves by jumping insist 
ently into a hansom and rattling up to St. John s 
Wood to reclaim the absentee. But if she had 
wished to be in time she had also desired not to 



792  

be abrupt, and would have been still more embar 
rassed to say what she aspired to promote than to 
phrase what she had proposed to hinder. She 
wanted to abstain tastefully, to interfere felici 
tously, and, more generally and justifiably (the 
small hours had come), to .see what her young 
charges were doing. She would probably have 
gathered that they were quarreling, and she ap 
peared now to be telegraphing to Sherringham 
to know if it were over. He took no notice of her 
signals, if signals they were ; he only felt that be 
fore he made way for the odious old woman there 
was one faint little spark he might strike from 
Miriam s flint. 

Without letting her guess that her mother was 
on the premises he turned again to his compan 
ion, half expecting that she would have taken her 
chance to regard their discussion as more than 
terminated and by the other egress flit away from 
him in silence. But she was still there; she 
was in the act of approaching him, with a mani 
fest intention of kindness, and she looked indeed, 
to his surprise, like an angel of mercy. 

" Don t let us part so disagreeably," she said, 
" with your trying to make me feel as if I were 
merely disobliging. It s no use talking we 
only hurt each other. Let us hold our tongues, 
like decent people, and go about our business. 
It isn t as if you hadn t any cure when you 
have such a capital one. Try it, try it, my dear 
friend you 11 see ! I wish you the highest pro- 



 793 

motion and the quickest every success and 
every reward. When you ve got them all, some 
day, and I Ve become a great swell too, we 11 
meet on that solid basis and you 11 be glad I ve 
been nasty now." 

" Surely before I leave you I ve a right to 
ask you this," Sherringham answered, holding 
fast in both his own the cool hand of farewell 
that she had finally tormented him with. " Are 
you ready to follow up by a definite promise your 
implied assurance that I have a remedy ? " 

" A definite promise ? " Miriam benignly gazed, 
with the perfection of evasion. "I don t imply 
that you have a remedy. I declare it on the 
housetops. That delightful girl " 

" I m not talking of any delightful girl but 
you ! " Peter broke in with a voice which, as he 
afterwards learned, struck Mrs. Rooth s ears, in 
the garden, with affright. " I simply hold you, 
under pain of being convicted of the grossest pre 
varication, to the strict sense of what you said a 
quarter of an hour ago." 

" Ah, I ve said so many things ; one has to 
do that to get rid of you. You rather hurt my 
hand," she added, jerking it away in a manner 
that showed that if she was an angel of mercy 
her mercy was partly for herself. 

" As I understand you, then, I may have some 
hope if I do renounce my profession ? " Peter 
pursued. " If I break with everything, my pros 
pects, my studies, my training, my emoluments, 



794  

my past and my future, the service of my coun 
try and the ambition of my life, and engage to 
take up instead the business of watching your in 
terests so far as I may learn how and ministering 
to your triumphs so far as may in me lie if 
after further reflection I decide to go through 
these preliminaries, have I your word that I may 
definitely look to you to reward me with your 
precious hand ? " 

" I don t think you have any right to put 
the question to me now," said Miriam with a 
promptitude partly produced, perhaps, by the 
clear-cut form Peter s solemn speech had given 
(it was a charm to hear it) to each item of his 
enumeration. "The case is so very contingent, 
so dependent on what you ingeniously call your 
further reflection. While you reserve yourself 
you ask me to commit myself. If it s a question 
of further reflection, why did you drag me up 
here? And then," she added, "I m so far from 
wishing you to take any such monstrous step." 

" Monstrous, you call it ? Just now you said 
it would be sublime." 

" Sublime, if it s done with spontaneity, with 
passion ; ridiculous, if it s done after further re 
flection. As you said, perfectly, a while ago, it 
isn t a thing to reason about." 

" Ah, what a help you d be to me in diplo 
macy !" Sherringham cried. "Will you give 
me a year to consider ? " 

"Would you trust me for a year ? " 



 795 

" Why not, if I m ready to trust you for life ? " 

" Oh, I should n t be free then, worse luck. 
And how much you seem to take for granted one 
must like you ! " 

" Remember that you ve made a great point 
of your liking me. Would n t you do so still 
more if I were heroic ? " 

Miriam looked at him a moment. " I think I 
should pity you, in such a cause. Give it all to 
her ; don t throw away a real happiness ! " 

"Ah, you can t back out of your position with 
a few vague and even rather impertinent words ! " 
Sherringham declared. "You accuse me of 
swallowing my protestations, but you swallow 
yours. You Ve painted in heavenly colors the 
sacrifice I m talking of, and now you must take 
the consequences." 

" The consequences ? " 

"Why, my coming back in a year to square 
you." 

" Ah, you re tiresome ! " cried Miriam. " Come 
back when you like. I don t wonder you ve 
grown desperate, but fancy me, then ! " she added, 
looking past him at a new interlocutor. 

"Yes, but if he ll square you!" Peter heard 
Mrs. Rooth s voice respond, conciliatingly, behind 
him. She had stolen up to the window now, she 
had passed the threshold, she was in the room, 
but her daughter had not been startled. " What 
is it he wants to do, dear ? " she continued, to 
Miriam. 



796  

" To induce me to marry him if he 11 go upon 
the stage. He 11 practice over there, where he s 
going, and then he 11 come back and appear. 
Is n t it too dreadful ? Talk him out of it, stay 
with him, soothe him ! " the girl hurried on. 
"You ll find some drinks and some biscuits in 
the cupboard keep him with you, pacify him, 
give him his little supper. Meanwhile, I 11 go to 
mine ; I 11 take the brougham ; don t follow ! " 

With these words Miriam bounded into the 
garden, and her white drapery shone for an in 
stant in the darkness before she disappeared. 
Peter looked about him, to pick up his hat, and 
while he did so he heard the bang of the gate 
and the quick carriage getting into motion. 
Mrs. Rooth appeared to sway excitedly, for a mo 
ment, in opposed directions : that of the impulse 
to rush after Miriam and that of the extraordinary 
possibility to which the young lady had alluded. 
She seemed in doubt, but at a venture, detaining 
him with a maternal touch, she twinkled up at 
their visitor like an insinuating glow-worm. 

" I m so glad you came." 

" I m not. I Ve got nothing by it," he said, 
finding his hat. 

" Oh, it was so beautiful ! " she coaxed. 

" The play yes, wonderful. I m afraid it s 
too late for me to avail myself of the privilege 
your daughter offers me. Good-night." 

" Oh, it s a pity ; won t you take anything?" 
asked Mrs. Rooth. " When I heard your voice 



 797 

so high I was scared and hung back." But be 
fore he could reply she added, " Are you really 
thinking of the stage ? " 

" It comes to the same thing." 

"Do you mean you ve proposed ?" 

" Oh, unmistakably." 

" And what does she say ? " 

" Why, you heard : she says I m an ass." 

" Ah, the little rascal ! " laughed Mrs. Rooth. 
" Leave her to me. I 11 help you. But you are 
mad. Give up nothing least of all your advan 
tages." 

" I won t give up your daughter," said Peter, 
reflecting that if this was cheap it was at any 
rate good enough for Mrs. Rooth. He mended 
it a little indeed by adding darkly : " But you 
can t make her take me." 

" I can prevent her taking any one else." 

" Oh, can you ! " Peter ejaculated, with more 
skepticism than ceremony. 

"You ll see you ll see." He passed into 
the garden, but, after she had blown out the can 
dles and drawn the window to, Mrs. Rooth went 
with him. " All you ve got to do is to be your 
self to be true to your fine position," she ex 
plained, as they proceeded. " Trust me with the 
rest trust me and be quiet." 

" How can one be quiet, after this magnificent 
evening ? " 

"Yes, but it s just that ! " panted the eager old 
woman. " It has launched her so, on this sea of 



798  

dangers, that to make up for the loss of the old 
security (don t you know ?) we must take a still 
firmer hold." 

"Ay, of what?" asked Sherringham, as Mrs. 
Rooth s comfort became vague while she stopped 
with him at the garden-door. 

" Ah, you know : of the real life, of the true an 
chor ! " Her hansom was waiting for her, and 
she added : " I kept it, " you see ; but a little 
extravagance, on the night one s fortune has 
come ! " 

Peter stared. Yes, there were people whose 
fortune had come ; but he managed to stammer : 
" Are you following her again ? " 

" For you for you ! " And Mrs. Rooth 
clambered into the vehicle. From the seat, en 
ticingly, she offered him the place beside her. 
" Won t you come too ? I know he asked you." 
Peter declined with a quick gesture, and as he 
turned away he heard her call after him, to cheer 
him on his lonely walk : " I shall keep this up ; I 
shall never lose sight of her ! " 



XLVII. 

WHEN Mrs. Dallow returned to London, just 
before London broke up, the fact was immedi 
ately known in Calcutta Gardens and was 
promptly communicated to Nick Dormer by his 
sister Bridget. He had learnt it in no other way 
he had had no correspondence with Julia dur 
ing her absence. He gathered that his mother 
and sisters were not ignorant of her whereabouts 
(he never mentioned her name to them) ; but as 
to this he was not sure whether the source of 
their information was the " Morning Post " or a 
casual letter received by the inscrutable Biddy. 
He knew that Biddy had some epistolary com 
merce with Julia, and he had an impression that 
Grace occasionally exchanged letters with Mrs. 
Gresham. Biddy, however, who, as he was well 
aware, was always studying what he would like, 
forbore to talk to him about the absent mistress 
of Harsh, beyond once dropping the remark that 
she had gone from Florence to Venice and was 
enjoying gondolas and sunsets too much to leave 
them. Nick s comment on this was that she was 
a happy woman to have such a go at Titian and 
Tintoret : as he spoke, and for some time after 
wards, the sense of how he himself should enjoy 



800  

a similar "go" made him ache with ineffectual 
longing. 

He had forbidden himself, for the present, to 
think of absence, not only because it would be in 
convenient and expensive, but because it would 
be a kind of retreat from the enemy, a concession 
to difficulty. The enemy was no particular per 
son and no particular body of persons : not his 
mother ; not Mr. Carteret, who, as Nick heard 
from the doctor at Beauclere, lingered on, sinking 
and sinking till his vitality appeared to have the 
vertical depth of a gold-mine ; not his pacified 
constituents, who had found a healthy diversion 
in returning another Liberal, wholly without Mrs. 
Dallow s aid (she had not participated even to the 
extent of a responsive telegram in the election) ; 
not his late colleagues in the House, nor the bit 
ing satirists of the newspapers, nor the brilliant 
women he took clown at dinner-parties (there was 
only one sense in which he ever took them down), 
nor his friends, nor his foes, nor his private 
thoughts, nor the periodical phantom of his 
shocked father : it was simply the general awk 
wardness of his situation. This awkwardness was 
connected with the sense of responsibility that 
Gabriel Nash so greatly deprecated ceasing to 
roam, of late, on purpose to miss as few scenes as 
possible of the drama, rapidly growing dull, alas, 
of his friend s destiny ; but that compromising re 
lation scarcely drew the soreness from it. The 
public flurry produced by Nick s collapse had only 



 8OI 

been large enough to mark the flatness of his po 
sition when it was over. To have had a few jokes 
cracked audibly at one s expense was not an or 
deal worth talking of ; the hardest thing about it 
was merely that there had not been enough of 
them to yield a proportion of good ones. Nick had 
felt, in short, the benefit of living in an age and in 
a society where number and pressure have, for 
the individual figure, especially when it s a zero, 
compensations almost equal to their cruelties. 

No, the pinch, for our young man s conscience, 
after a few weeks had passed, was simply an 
acute mistrust of the superficiality of performance 
into which the desire to justify himself might 
hurry him. That desire was passionate as regards 
Julia Dallow ; it was ardent also as regards his 
mother ; and, to make it absolutely uncomfortable, 
it was complicated with the conviction that 
neither of them would recognize his justification 
even when she should see it. They probably 
could n t if they would, and very likely they 
would n t if they could. He assured himself, how 
ever, that this limitation would n t matter ; it was 
their affair his own was simply to have the 
right sort of thing to show. The work he was 
now attempting was not the right sort of thing ; 
though doubtless Julia, for instance, would dislike 
it almost as much as if it were. The two por 
traits of Miriam, after the first exhilaration of his 
finding himself at large, filled him with no private 
glee : they were not in the direction in which, for 



802  

the present, he wished really to move. There 
were moments when he felt almost angry, though 
of course he held his tongue, when by the few 
persons who saw them they were pronounced 
wonderfully clever. That they were wonderfully 
clever was just the detestable thing in them, so 
active had that cleverness been in making them 
seem better than they were. There were people 
to whom he would have been ashamed to show 
them, and these were the people whom it would 
give him most pleasure some day to please. Not 
only had he many an hour of disgust with his 
actual work, but he thought he saw, as in an ugly 
revelation, that nature had cursed him with an 
odious facility and that the lesson of his life, the 
sternest and wholesomest, would be to keep out 
,of the trap it had laid for him. He had fallen 
into this trap on the threshold, and he had only 
scrambled out with his honor. He had a talent 
for appearance, and that was the fatal thing ; he 
had a damnable suppleness and a gift of immedi 
ate response, a readiness to oblige, that made him 
seem to take up causes which he really left lying, 
enabled him to learn enough about them in an 
hour to have all the air of having made them his 
own. Many people called them their own who 
had taken them in much less. He was too clever 
by half, since this pernicious overflow had been 
at the bottom of deep disappointments and heart 
burnings. He had assumed a virtue and enjoyed 
assuming it, and the assumption had cheated his 



 803 

father and his mother and his affianced wife and 
his rich benefactor and the candid burgesses of 
Harsh and the cynical reporters of the newspa 
pers. His enthusiasms had been but young cu 
riosity, his speeches had been young agility, his 
professions and adhesions had been like postage- 
stamps without glue: the head was all right, but 
they would n t stick. He stood ready now to 
wring the neck of the irrepressible vice which 
certainly would like nothing better than to get 
him into further trouble. His only real justifica 
tion would be to turn patience (his own of course) 
inside out ; yet if there should be a way to mis 
read that recipe his humbugging genius could be 
trusted infallibly to discover it. Cheap and easy 
results would dangle before him, little amateurish 
conspicuities, helped by his history, at exhibi 
tions ; putting it in his power to triumph with a 
quick " What do you say to that ? " over those he 
had wounded. The fear of this danger was cor 
rosive ; it poisoned even legitimate joys. If he 
should have a striking picture at the Academy 
next year, it would n t be a crime ; yet he could 
n t help suspecting any conditions that would 
enable him to be striking so soon. In this way 
he felt quite enough how Gabriel Nash " had " 
him whenever he railed at his fever for proof, and 
how inferior as a productive force the desire to 
win over the ill-disposed might be to the principle 
of quiet growth. Nash had a foreign manner of 
lifting up his finger and waving it before him, as 



804  

if to put an end to everything, whenever it be 
came, in conversation or discussion, to any extent 
a question whether any one would like anything. 
It was presumably, in some degree at least, a 
due respect for the principle of quiet growth that 
kept Nick on the spot at present, made him stick 
fast to Rosedale Road and Calcutta Gardens and 
deny himself the simplifications of absence. Do 
what he would he could not despoil himself of the 
impression that the disagreeable was somehow 
connected with the salutary, and the "quiet" 
with the disagreeable, when stubbornly borne ; 
so he resisted a hundred impulses to run away to 
Paris or to Florence, and the temptation to per 
suade himself by material motion that he was 
launched. He stayed in London because it 
seemed to him that there he was more conscious 
of what he had undertaken, and he had a horror 
of shirking that consciousness. One element in 
it indeed was the perception that he would have 
found no great convenience in a foreign journey, 
even had his judgment approved such a subter 
fuge. The stoppage of his supplies from Beau- 
clere had now become an historic fact, with some 
thing of the majesty of its class about it : he had 
had time to see what a difference this would 
make in his life. His means were small and he 
had several old debts, the number of which, as he 
believed, loomed large to his mother s imagina 
tion. He could never tell her that she exag 
gerated, because he told her nothing of that sort 



 805 

now : they had no intimate talk, for an impene 
trable partition, a tall bristling hedge of un- 
trimmed misconceptions, had sprung up between 
them. Poor Biddy had made a hole in it, through 
which she squeezed, from side to side, to keep up 
communications, at the cost of many rents and 
scratches ; but Lady Agnes walked straight and 
stiff, never turning her head, never stopping to 
pluck the least little daisy of consolation. It was 
in this manner she wished to signify that she 
had accepted her wrongs. She draped herself in 
them as in a kind of Roman mantle, and she 
never looked so proud and wasted and handsome 
as now that her eyes rested only upon ruins. 

Nick was extremely sorry for her, though he 
thought there was a dreadful want of grace in 
her never setting a foot in Rosedale Road (she 
mentioned his studio no more than if it had been 
a private gambling-house, or something worse) ; 
sorry because he was well aware that, for the 
hour, everything must appear to her to have 
crumbled. The luxury of Broadwood would have 
to crumble : his mind was very clear about that. 
Biddy s prospects had withered to the finest, 
dreariest dust, and Biddy indeed, taking a lesson 
from her brother s perversities, seemed little dis 
posed to better a bad business. She professed 
the most peacemaking sentiments, but when it 
came really to doing something to brighten up 
the scene she showed herself portentously cor 
rupted. After Peter Sherringham s heartless 



806  

flight she had wantonly slighted an excellent op 
portunity to repair her misfortune. Lady Agnes 
had reason to know, about the end of June, that 
young Mr. Grindon, the only son (the other 
children were girls) of an immensely rich indus 
trial and political baronet in the north, was lit 
erally waiting for the faintest sign. This reason 
she promptly imparted to her younger daughter, 
whose intelligence had to take it in, but who had 
shown it no other consideration. Biddy had set 
her charming face as a stone ; she would have 
nothing to do with signs, and she, practically 
speaking, willfully, wickedly refused a magnifi 
cent offer, so that the young man carried his 
noble expectations elsewhere. How much in 
earnest he had been was proved by the fact that, 
before Goodwood had come and gone, he was cap 
tured by Lady Muriel Macpherson. It was su 
perfluous to insist on the frantic determination 
to get married revealed by such an accident as 
that. Nick knew of this episode only through 
Grace, and he deplored its having occurred in the 
midst of other disasters. 

He knew, or he suspected, something more as 
well something about his brother Percival 
which, if it should come to light, no season would 
be genial enough to gloss over. It had usually 
been supposed that Percy s store of comfort 
against the ills of life was confined to the infal 
libility of his rifle. He was not sensitive, but he 
had always the consolation of killing something. 



 8o/ 

It had suddenly come to Nick s ears, however, 
that he had another resource as well, in the per 
son of a robust countrywoman, housed in an ivied 
corner of Warwickshire, in whom he had long 
been interested and whom, without any flourish 
of magnanimity, he had ended by making his 
wife. The situation of the latest born of the 
pledges of this affection, a blooming boy (there 
had been two or three previously), was therefore 
perfectly regular and of a nature to make a dif 
ference in the worldly position, as the phrase is, 
of his moneyless uncle. If there be degrees in 
the absolute and Percy had an heir (others, more 
over, would supposably come), Nick would have 
to regard himself as still more moneyless than 
before. His brother s last step was doubtless, 
under the circumstances, to be commended ; but 
such discoveries were enlivening only when they 
were made in other families, and Lady Agnes 
would scarcely enjoy learning to what tune she 
had become a grandmother. 

Nick forbore, from delicacy, to intimate to 
Biddy that he thought it a pity she could n t care 
for Mr. Grindon ; but he had a private sense that 
if she had been capable of such an achievement 
it would have lightened a little the weight he 
himself had to carry. He bore her a slight 
grudge, which lasted until Julia Dallow came 
back ; when the circumstance of the girl s being 
summoned immediately down to Harsh created 
a diversion that was perhaps, after all, only fanci- 



8o8  

ful. Biddy, as we know, entertained a theory, 
which Nick had found occasion to combat, that 
Mrs. Dallow had not treated him perfectly well ; 
therefore in going to Harsh the very first time 
Julia held out a hand to her, so jealous a little 
sister must have recognized a special inducement. 
The inducement might have been that Julia had 
comfort for her, that she was acting by the direct 
advice of this acute lady, that they were still in 
close communion on the question of the offers 
Biddy was not to accept, that in short Peter 
Sherringham s sister had taken upon herself to 
see that Biddy should remain free until the day 
of the fugitive s inevitable return. Once or 
twice, indeed, Nick wondered whether Mrs. Dal 
low herself was visited, in a larger sense, by the 
thought of retracing her steps whether she 
wished to draw out her young friend s opinion as 
to how she might do so gracefully. During the 
few days she was in town Nick had seen her 
twice, in Great Stanhope Street, but not alone. 
She had said to him, on one of these occasions, 
in her odd, explosive way : " I should have thought 
you d have gone away somewhere it must be 
such a bore." Of course she firmly believed he 
was staying for Miriam, which he really was not ; 
and probably she had written this false impression 
off to Peter, who, still more probably, would pre 
fer to regard it as just. Nick was staying for 
Miriam only in the sense that he should be very 
glad of the money he might receive for the por- 



 809 

trait he was engaged in painting, That money 
would be a great convenience to him, in spite of 
the obstructive ground Miriam had taken in pre 
tending (she had blown half a gale about it) that 
he had had no right to dispose of such a produc 
tion without her consent. His answer to this 
was simply that the purchaser was so little of a 
stranger that it did n t go, as it were, out of the 
family, out of hers. It did n t matter that Miriam 
should protest that if Mr. Sherringham had for 
merly been no stranger he was now utterly one, 
so that there could be nothing less soothing to 
him than to see her hated image on his wall. He 
would back out of the bargain, and Nick would 
be left with his work on his hands. Nick jeered 
at this shallow theory and, when she came to sit, 
the question served as well as another to sprinkle 
their familiar silences with chaff. Nick already 
knew something, as we have seen, of the condi 
tions in which his distracted kinsman had left 
England ; and this connected itself, in casual 
meditation, with some of the calculations that he 
attributed to Julia and Biddy. There had natu 
rally been a sequel to the queer behavior in 
which Peter had indulged, at the theatre, on the 
eve of his departure a sequel embodied in a re 
mark dropped by Miriam in the course of the 
first sitting she gave Nick after her great night. 
" Fancy " so this observation ran " fancy 
the dear man finding time, in the press of all his 
last duties, to ask me to marry him ! " 



8 10 , 

" He told me you had found time, in the press 
of all yours, to say you would," Nick replied. 
And this was pretty much all that had passed on 
the subject between them, save, of course, that 
Miriam immediately made it clear that Peter had 
grossly misinformed him. What had happened 
was that she had said she would do nothing of 
the sort. She professed a desire not to be con 
fronted again with this trying theme, and Nick 
easily fell in with it, from a definite preference 
he now had not to handle that kind of subject 
with her. If Julia had false ideas about him, and 
if Peter had them too, his part of the business 
was to take the simplest course to establish that 
falsity. There were difficulties indeed attached 
even to the simplest course, but there would be 
a difficulty the less if, in conversation, one should 
forbear to meddle with the general suggestive 
topic of intimate unions. It is certain that in 
these days Nick cultivated the practice of forbear 
ances for which he did not receive, for which 
perhaps he never would receive, due credit. 

He had been convinced for some time that one 
of the next things he should hear would be that 
Mrs. Dallow had arranged to marry Mr. Mac- 
george or some such leader of multitudes. He 
could think of that now, he found think of it 
with resignation, even when Julia was before his 
eyes, looking so handsomely forgetful that her 
air had to be taken as referring still more to their 
original intimacy than to his comparatively super- 



 8ll 

ficial offense. What made this accomplishment 
of his own remarkable was that there was some 
thing else he thought of quite as much the 
fact that he had only to see her again to feel by 
how great a charm she had in the old days taken 
possession of him. This charm operated appar 
ently in a very direct, primitive way : her pres 
ence diffused it and fully established it, but her 
absence left comparatively little of it behind. It 
dwelt in the very facts of her person it was 
something that she happened physically to be ; 
yet (considering that the question was of some 
thing very like loveliness) its envelope of associ 
ations, of memories and recurrences, had no great 
density. She packed it up and took it away with 
her, as if she had been a woman who had come 
to sell a set of laces. The laces were as wonder 
ful as ever when they were taken out of the box, 
but to get another look at them you had to send 
for the woman. What was above all remarkable 
was that Miriam Rooth was much less irresistible 
to our young man than Mrs. Dallow could be 
when Mrs. Dallow was on the spot. He could 
paint Miriam, day after day, without any agitating 
blur of vision ; in fact the more he saw of her the 
clearer grew the atmosphere through which she 
blazed, the more her richness became one with 
that of the flowering picture. There are recipro 
cities and special sympathies, in such relations ; 
mysterious affinities they used to be called, divi 
nations of private congruity. Nick had an unex- 



8l2  

pressed conviction that if, as he had often wanted 
and proposed, he had embarked with Mrs. Dallovv 
in this particular quest of a great prize, disaster 
would have overtaken them on the deep waters. 
Even with the limited risk, indeed, disaster had 
come ; but it was of a different kind, and it had the 
advantage for him that now she could n t reproach 
and accuse him as the cause of it couldn t do 
so at least on any ground he was obliged to recog 
nize. She would never know how much he had 
cared for her, how much he cared for her still ; 
inasmuch as the conclusive proof, for himself, was 
his conscious reluctance to care for another wo 
man, which she positively misread. Some day he 
would doubtless try to do that ; but such a day 
seemed as yet far off, and he had no spite, no 
vindictive impulse, to help him. The soreness 
that was mingled with his liberation, the sense of 
indignity even, as of a full cup suddenly dashed, 
by a blundering hand, from his lips, demanded 
certainly a balm ; but it found it, for the time, 
in another passion, not in a rancorous exercise 
of the same a passion strong enough to make 
him forget what a pity it was that he was not 
made to care for two women at once. 

As soon as Mrs. Dallow returned to England 
he broke ground, to his mother, on the subject 
of her making Julia understand that she and the 
girls now regarded their occupancy of Broadwood 
as absolutely terminated. He had already, sev 
eral weeks before, picked a little at this arid 



 813 

tract, but in the interval the soil appeared to 
have formed again. It was disagreeable to him 
to impose such a renunciation on Lady Agnes, 
and it was especially disagreeable to have to 
phrase it and discuss it and perhaps insist upon 
it. He would have liked the whole business to 
be tacit a little triumph of silent delicacy. But 
he found reasons to suspect that what in fact 
would be most tacit was Julia s certain endurance 
of any chance zV/delicacy. Lady Agnes had a 
theory that they had virtually "practically," 
as she said given up the place, so that there 
was no need of making a splash about it ; but 
Nick discovered, in the course of a conversation 
with Biddy more rigorous perhaps than any to 
which he had ever subjected her, that none of 
their property had been removed from the de 
lightful house none of the things (there were 
ever so many things) that Lady Agnes had caused 
to be conveyed there when they took possession. 
Her ladyship was the proprietor of innumerable 
articles of furniture, relics and survivals of her 
former greatness, and moved about the world 
with a train of heterogeneous baggage ; so that 
her quiet overflow into the spaciousness of Broad- 
wood had had all the luxury of a final subsidence. 
What Nick had to propose to her now was a 
dreadful combination, a relapse into all the things 
she most hated seaside lodgings, bald store 
houses in the Marylebone Road, little London 
rooms crammed with things that caught the dirt 



8 14  

and made them stuffy. He was afraid he should 
really finish her, and he himself was surprised, in 
a degree, at his insistence. He would n t have 
supposed that he should have cared so much, but 
he found he did care intensely. He cared enough 
it says everything to explain to his mother 
that, practically, her retention of Broadwood 
would be the violation of an agreement. Julia 
had given them the place on the understanding 
that he was to marry her, and since he was not 
to marry her they had no right to keep the place. 
" Yes, you make the mess and we pay the pen 
alty ! " Lady Agnes flashed out ; but this was the 
only overt protest that she made, except indeed 
to contend that their withdrawal would be an act 
ungracious and offensive to Julia. She looked as 
she had looked during the months that succeeded 
his father s death, but she gave a general grim 
assent to the proposition that, let Julia take it 
as she would, their own duty was unmistakably 
clear. 

It was Grace who was the principal represen 
tative of the idea that Julia would be outraged 
by such a step ; she never ceased to repeat that 
she had never heard of anything so "nasty." 
Nick would have expected this of Grace, but he 
felt rather deserted and betrayed when Biddy 
murmured to him that she knew that there was 
really no need of their sacrificing their mother s 
comfort to a mere fancy. She intimated that if 
Nick would only consent to their going on with 



 815 

Broadwood as if nothing had happened (or rather 
as if everything had happened), she would answer 
for J _ilia. For almost the first time in his life 
Nick disliked what Biddy said to him, and he 
gave her a sharp rejoinder, embodying the gen 
eral opinion that they all had enough to do to 
answer for themselves. He remembered after 
wards the way she looked at him, startled, even 
frightened, with rising tears, before turning away. 
He held that it would be time enough to judge 
how Julia would take it after they had thrown up 
the place ; and he made it his duty to see that his 
mother should address to Mrs. Dallow, by letter, 
a formal notification of their retirement. Mrs. 
Dallow could protest then if she liked. Nick 
was aware that, in general, he was not practical ; 
he could imagine why, from his early years, 
people should have joked him about it. But this 
time he was determined that his behavior should 
be founded on a rigid view of things as they 
were. He did n t see his mother s letter to Julia, 
but he knew that it went. He thought she would 
have been more loyal if she had shown it to him, 
though of course there could be but little ques 
tion of loyalty now. That it had really been 
written, however, very much on the lines he dic 
tated, was clear to him from the subsequent sur 
prise which Lady Agnes s blankness did not pre 
vent him from divining. 

Julia answered her letter, but in unexpected 
terms : she had apparently neither resisted nor 



8l6  

protested ; she had simply been very glad to get 
her house back again and had not accused any of 
them of nastiness. Nick saw no more of her let 
ter than he had seen of his mother s, but he was 
able to say to Grace (to Lady Agnes he was stu 
diously mute), " My poor child, you see, after all, 
that we haven t kicked up such a row." Grace 
shook her head and looked gloomy and deeply 
wise, replying that he had no cause to triumph 
they were so far from having seen the end of it 
yet. Then he guessed that his mother had com 
plied with his wish on the calculation that it 
would be a mere form, that Julia would entreat 
them not to be so fantastic, and that he would 
then, in the presence of her wounded surprise, 
consent to a quiet continuance, so much in the 
interest (the air of Broadwood had a purity !) of 
the health of all of them. But since Julia jumped 
at their relinquishment he had no chance to be 
mollified : he had only to persist in having been 
right. 

At bottom, probably, he himself was a little 
surprised at her eagerness. Literally speaking, 
it was not perfectly graceful. He was sorry his 
mother had been so deceived, but he was sorrier 
still for Biddy s mistake it showed she might 
be mistaken about other things. Nothing was 
left now but for Lady Agnes to say, as she did, 
substantially, whenever she saw him : "We are 
to prepare to spend the autumn at Worthing, 
then, or some other horrible place ? I don t know 



 . 817 

their names : it s the only thing we can afford." 
There was an implication in this that if he ex 
pected her to drag her girls about to country- 
houses, in a continuance of the fidgety effort to 
work them off, he must understand at once that 
she was now too weary and too sad and too sick. 
She had done her best for them, and it had all 
been vain and cruel, and now the poor creatures 
must look out for themselves. To the grossness 
of Biddy s misconduct she need n t refer, nor to 
the golden opportunity this young lady had for 
feited by her odious treatment of Mr. Grindon. 
It was clear that this time Lady Agnes was in 
curably discouraged ; so much so as to fail to 
glean the dimmest light from the fact that the 
girl was really making a long stay at Harsh. 
Biddy went to and fro two or three times and 
then, in August, fairly settled there ; and what 
her mother mainly saw in her absence was the 
desire to keep out of the way of household re 
minders of her depravity. In fact, as it turned 
out, Lady Agnes and Grace, in the first days of 
August, gathered themselves together for another 
visit to the old lady who had been Sir Nicholas s 
godmother ; after which they went somewhere 
else, so that the question of Worthing had not to 
be immediately faced. 

Nick stayed on in London with a passion of 
work fairly humming in his ears ; he was con 
scious, with joy, that for three or four months, in 
the empty Babylon, he would have generous 



8l8  

days. But toward the end of August he got a 
letter from Grace in which she spoke of her sit 
uation, and her mother s, in a manner that made 
him feel he ought to do something tactful. They 
were paying a third visit (he knew that in Cal 
cutta Gardens lady s-maids had been to and fro 
with boxes, replenishments of wardrobes), and 
yet somehow the outlook for the autumn was 
dark. Grace did n t say it in so many words, but 
what he read between the lines was that they 
had no more invitations. What therefore was to 
become of them ? People liked them well enough 
when Biddy was with them, but they did n t care 
for her mother and her, tout pur, and Biddy was 
cooped up indefinitely with Julia. This was not 
the manner in which Grace used to allude to her 
sister s happy visits to Mrs. Dallow, and the 
change of tone made Nick wince with a sense of 
all that had collapsed. Biddy was a little fish 
worth landing, in short, scantily as she seemed 
disposed to bite, and Grace s rude probity could 
admit that she herself was not. 

Nick had an inspiration : by way of doing 
something tactful he went down to Brighton and 
took lodgings for the three ladies, for several 
weeks, the quietest and sunniest he could find. 
This he intended as a kindly surprise, a reminder 
of how he had his mother s comfort at heart, how 
he could exert himself and save her trouble. 
But he had no sooner concluded his bargain (it 
was a more costly one than he had at first -calcu- 



 819 

lated) than he was bewildered, as he privately 
phrased it quite "stumped," at learning that the 
three ladies were to pass the autumn at Broad- 
wood with Julia. Mrs. Dallow had taken the 
place into familiar use again, and she was now 
correcting their former surprise at her crude 
concurrence (this was infinitely characteristic of 
Julia) by inviting them to share it with her. Nick 
wondered vaguely what she was " up to ; " but 
when his mother treated herself to the fine irony 
of addressing him an elaborately humble inquiry 
as to whether he would consent to their accept 
ing the merciful refuge (she repeated this ex 
pression three times), he replied that she might 
do exactly as she liked : he would only mention 
that he should not feel himself at liberty to come 
and see her at Broadwood. This condition 
proved, apparently, to Lady Agnes s mind, no 
hindrance, and she and her daughters were pres 
ently reinstalled in the very apartments they had 
learned to love. This time it was even better 
than before; they had still fewer expenses. The 
expenses were Nick s : he had to pay a forfeit to 
the landlady at Brighton for backing out of his 
contract. He said nothing to his mother about 
this bungled business he was literally afraid ; 
but an event that befell at the same moment re 
minded him afresh that it was not the time to 
choose to squander money. Mr. Carteret drew 
his last breath ; quite painlessly it seemed, as the 
closing scene was described at Beauclere when 



820  

our young man went down to the funeral. Two 
or t hree weeks afterwards the contents of his will 
were made public in the " Illustrated London 
News," where it definitely appeared that he left 
a very large fortune, not a penny of which was 
to go to Nick. The provision for Mr. Chayter s 
declining years was very handsome. 



XLVIII. 

MIRIAM had mounted, at a bound, in her new 
part, several steps in the ladder of fame, and at 
the climax of the London season this fact was 
brought home to her from hour to hour. It 
produced a thousand solicitations and entangle 
ments, so that she rapidly learned that to be 
celebrated takes up almost as much of one s own 
time as of other people s. Even though, as she 
boasted, she had reduced to a science the practice 
of " working " her mother (she made use of the 
good lady socially to the utmost, pushing her per 
petually into the breach), there were many occa 
sions on which it was represented to her that she 
could not be disobliging without damaging her 
cause. She made almost an income out of the 
photographers (their appreciation of her as a 
subject knew no bounds), and she supplied the 
newspapers with columns of irreducible copy. To 
the gentlemen who sought speech of her on be 
half of these organs she poured forth, vindic 
tively, floods of unscrupulous romance ; she told 
them all different tales, and as her mother told 
them others more marvelous yet publicity was 
cleverly caught by rival versions, surpassing- 
each other in authenticity. The whole case was 



822  

remarkable, was unique ; for if the girl was ad 
vertised by the bewilderment of her readers, she 
seemed to every skeptic, when he went to see 
her, as fine as if he had discovered her for him 
self. She was still accommodating enough, how 
ever, from time to time, to find an hour to come 
and sit to Nick Dormer, and he helped himself 
further by going to her theatre whenever he 
could. He was conscious that Julia Dallow 
would probably hear of that and triumph with a 
fresh sense of how right she had been ; but this 
reflection only made him sigh resignedly, so true 
it struck him as being that there are some things 
explanation can never better, can never touch. 

Miriam brought Basil Dashwood once to see 
her portrait, and Basil, who commended it in 
general, directed his criticism mainly to two 
points its not yet being finished and its not 
having gone into that year s Academy. The 
young actor was visibly fidgety : he felt the con 
tagion of Miriam s rapid pace, the quick beat of 
her success, and, looking at everything now from 
the standpoint of that speculation, could scarcely 
contain his impatience at the painter s clumsy 
slowness. He thought the second picture much 
better than the other one, but somehow it ought, 
by that time, to be before the public. Having a 
great deal of familiar proverbial wisdom, he put 
forth with vehemence the idea that in every 
great crisis there is nothing like striking while 
the iron is hot. He even betrayed a sort cf 



 823 

impression that with a little good-will Nick might 
wind up the job and still get the Academy people 
to take him in. Basil knew some of them,; he 
all but offered to speak to them the case was 
so exceptional ; he had no doubt he could get 
something done. Against the appropriation of 
the work by Peter Sherringham he explicitly and 
loudly protested, in spite of the homeliest recom 
mendations of silence from Miriam ; and it was, 
indeed, easy to guess how such an arrangement 
would interfere with his own conception of the 
eventual right place for the two portraits the 
vestibule of the theatre, where every one going 
in and out would see them, suspended face to 
face and surrounded by photographs, artistically 
disposed, of the young actress in a variety of 
characters. Dashwood showed a largeness of 
view in the way he jumped to the conviction 
that, in this position, the pictures would really 
help to draw. Considering the virtue he attrib 
uted to Miriam the idea was exempt from narrow 
prejudice. 

Moreover, though a trifle feverish, he was really 
genial ; he repeated, more than once : " Yes, my 
dear sir, you ve done it this time." This was a 
favorite formula with him ; when some allusion 
was made to the girl s success he greeted it also 
with a comfortable " This time she has done it." 
There was a hint of knowledge and far calcula 
tion in his tone. It appeared before he went 
that this time even he himself had done it he 



824  

had taken up something that would really answer. 
He told Nick more about Miriam, more about 
her affairs at that moment, at least, than she her 
self had communicated, contributing strongly to 
our young man s impression that one by one 
every element of a great destiny was being 
dropped into her cup. Nick himself tasted of 
success vicariously for the hour. Miriam let 
Dashwood talk only to contradict him, and con 
tradicted him only to show how indifferently she 
could do it. She treated him as if she had noth 
ing more to learn about his folly, but as if it had 
taken intimate friendship to reveal to her the full 
extent of it. Nick did n t mind her intimate 
friendships, but he ended by disliking Dashwood, 
who irritated him a circumstance in which 
poor Julia, if it had come to her knowledge, 
would doubtless have found a damning eloquence. 
Miriam was more pleased with herself than ever : 
she now made no scruple of admitting that she 
enjoyed all her advantages. She was beginning 
to have a fuller vision of how successful success 
could be ; she took everything as it came 
dined out every Sunday, and even went into the 
country till the Monday morning ; she had a 
hundred distinguished names on her lips and 
wonderful tales about the people who were mak 
ing up to her. She struck Nick as less serious 
than she had been hitherto, as making even an 
aggressive show of frivolity ; but he was con 
scious of no obligation to reprehend her for it 



 825 

the less as he had a dim vision that some effect 
of that sort, some irritation of his curiosity, was 
what she desired to produce. She would perhaps 
have liked, for reasons best known to herself, to 
look as if she were throwing herself away, not 
being able to do anything else. He could n t 
talk to her as if he took an immense interest in 
her career, because in fact he did n t ; she remained 
to him, primarily and essentially, a pictorial ob 
ject, with the nature of whose vicissitudes he was 
concerned (putting common charity and his per 
sonal good-nature, of course, aside) only so far as 
they had something to say in her face. How 
could he know, in advance, what twist of her life 
would say most ? so possible was it even that 
complete failure or some incalculable perversion 
would only make her, for his particular purpose, 
more magnificent. 

After she had left him, at any rate, the day she 
came with Basil Dashwood, and still more on a 
later occasion, as he turned back to his work 
when he had put her into her carnage, the last 
time, for that year, that he saw her after she 
had left him it occurred to him, in the light of 
her quick distinction, that there were mighty 
differences in the famous artistic life. Miriam 
was already in a glow of glory which moreover 
was probably but a faint spark in relation to the 
blaze to come ; and as he closed the door upon 
her and took up his palette to rub it with a dirty 
cloth the little room in which his own battle was 



826  

practically to be fought looked wofully cold and 
gray and mean. It was lonely, and yet it was 
peopled with unfriendly Shadows (so thick he saw 
them gathering in winter twilights to come), the 
duller conditions, the longer patiences, the less 
immediate and less personal joys. His late be 
ginning was there, and his wasted youth, the mis 
takes that would still bring forth children after 
their image, the sedentary solitude, the clumsy 
obscurity, the poor explanations, the foolishness 
that he foresaw in having to ask people to wait, 
and wait longer, and wait again, for a fruition 
which, to their sense at least, would be an anti 
climax. He cared enough for it, whatever it 
would be, to feel that his pertinacity might enter 
into comparison even with such a productive 
force as Miriam s. This was, after all, in his 
bare studio, the most collective dim presence, the 
one that was most sociable to him as he sat there 
and that made it the right place however wrong 
it was the sense that it was to the thing in it 
self he was attached. This was Miriam s case, 
but the contrast, which she showed him she also 
felt, was in the number of other things that she 
got with the thing in itself. 

I hasten to add that our young man had hours 
when this fine substance struck him as requiring, 
for a complete appeal, no adjunct whatever as 
being in its own splendor a summary of all ad 
juncts and apologies. I have related that the 
great collections, the National Gallery and the 



 827 

Museum were sometimes rather a series of dead 
surfaces to him ; but the sketch I have attempted 
of him will have been inadequate if it fails to 
suggest that there were other days when, as he 
strolled through them, he plucked right and left 
perfect nosegays of reassurance. Bent as he was 
on working in the modern, which spoke to him 
with a thousand voices, he judged it better for 
long periods not to haunt the earlier masters, 
whose conditions had -been so different (later he 
came to see that it did n t matter much, espe 
cially if one did n t go) ; but he was liable to ac 
cidental deflections from this theory liable in 
particular to want to take a look at one of the 
great portraits of the past. These were the 
things that were the most inspiring, in the sense 
that they were the things that, while generations, 
while worlds had come and gone, seemed most to 
survive and testify. As he stood before them 
sometimes the perfection of their survival struck 
him as the. supreme eloquence, the reason that 
included all others, thanks to the language of art, 
the richest and most universal. Empires and 
systems and conquests had rolled over the globe 
and every kind of greatness had risen and passed 
away, but the beauty of the great pictures had 
known nothing of death or change, and the ages 
had only sweetened their freshness. The same 
faces, the same figures looked out at different cen 
turies, knowing a deal the century did n t, and 
when they joined hands they made the inde-

1 structible thread on which the pearls of history 
were strung. 

Miriam notified her artist that her theatre was 
to close on the loth of August, immediately after 
which she was to start, with the company, on a 
tremendous tour of the provinces. They were to 
make a lot of money, but they were to have no 
holiday, and she didn t want one; she only 
wanted to keep at it and make the most of her 
limited opportunities for practice ; inasmuch as, 
at that rate, playing but two parts a year (and 
such parts she despised them !) she should n t 
have mastered the rudiments of her trade before 
decrepitude would compel her to lay it by. The 
first time she came to the studio after her visit 
with Dashwood she sprang up abruptly, at the 
end of half an hour, saying she could sit no more 
she had had enough of it. She was visibly 
restless and preoccupied, and though Nick had 
not waited till now to discover that she had more 
moods than he had tints on his palette, he had 
never yet seen her fitfulness at this particular 
angle. It was a trifle unbecoming and he was 
ready to let her go. She looked round the place 
as if she were suddenly tired of it, and then she 
said mechanically, in a heartless London way, 
while she smoothed down her gloves, " So you re 
just going to stay on ? " After he had confessed 
that this was his dark purpose she continued in 
the same casual, talk-making manner : " I dare 
say it s the best thing for you. You re just go 
ing to grind, eh ? " 



 829 

"I see before me an eternity of grinding." 

" All alone, by yourself, in this dull little hole ? 
You will be conscientious, you will be virtuous." 

" Oh, my solitude will be mitigated I shall 
have models and people." 

" What people what models ? " Miriam asked, 
before the glass, arranging her hat. 

" Well, no one so good as you." 

"That s a prospect !" the girl laughed; "for 
all the good you ve got out of me ! " 

" You re no judge of that quantity," said Nick, 
"and even I can t measure it just yet. Have I 
been rather a brute ? I can easily believe it ; I 
have n t talked to you I haven t amused you 
as I might. The truth is, painting people is a 
very absorbing, exclusive occupation. You can t 
do much to them besides." 

" Yes, it s a cruel honor." 

" Cruel that s too much," Nick objected. 

" I mean it s one you should n t confer on peo 
ple you like, for when it s over it s over : it kills 
your interest in them and after you ve finished 
them you don t like them any more." 

" Surely I like you," Nick returned, sitting 
tilted back, before his picture, with his hands in 
his pockets. 

" We Ve done very well : it s something not to 
have quarreled," said Miriam, smiling at him 
now and seeming more in it. " I would n t have 
had you slight your work I would n t have had 
you do it badly. But there s no fear of that for 



830  

you," she went on. " You re the real thing and 
the rare bird. I have n t lived with you this way 
without seeing that : you re the sincere artist so 
much more than I. No, no, don t protest," she 
added, with one of her sudden fine transitions to 
a deeper tone. " You 11 do things that will hand 
on your name when my screeching is happily 
over. Only you do seem to me, I confess, rather 
high and dry here I speak from the point of 
view of your comfort and of my personal interest 
in you. You strike me as kind of lonely, as the 
Americans say rather cut off and isolated in 
your grandeur. Have n t you any confreres 
fellow-artists and people of that sort ? Don t 
they come near you ? " 

" I don t know them much, I ve always been 
afraid of them, and how can they take me seri 
ously ? " 

" Well, I ve got confreres, and sometimes I 
wish I had n t ! But does your sister never come 
near you any more, or is it only the fear of meet 
ing me ? " 

Nick was aware that his mother had a theory 
that Biddy was constantly bundled home from 
Rosedale Road at the approach of improper per 
sons : she was as angry at this as if she would n t 
have been more so if the child had been suffered 
to stay; but the explanation he gave his present 
visitor was nearer the truth. He reminded Mir 
iam that he had already told her (he had been 
careful to do this, so as not to let it appear she 



THE TRAGIC MUSR. 831 

was avoided) that his sister was now most of the 
time in the country, staying with an hospitable 
relation. 

" Oh, yes," the girl rejoined to this, "with Mr. 
Sherringham s sister, Mrs. what s her name ? 
I always forget it." And when Nick had pro 
nounced the word with a reluctance he doubtless 
failed sufficiently to conceal (he hated to talk 
about Mrs. Dallow ; he did n t know what busi 
ness Miriam had with her), she exclaimed, " That s 
the one the beauty, the wonderful beauty. I 
shall never forget how handsome she looked the 
day she found me here. I don t in the least re 
semble her, but I should like to have a try at that 
type, some day, in a comedy of manners. But 
who will write me a comedy of manners ? There 
it is ! The trouble would be, no doubt, that I 
should push her a la charge" 

Nick listened to these remarks in silence, saying 
to himself that if Miriam should have the bad 
taste (she seemed trembling on the brink of it) to 
make an allusion to what had passed between 
the lady in question and himself, he should dis 
like her utterly. It would show him she was a 
coarse creature, after all. Her good genius inter 
posed, however as against this hard penalty, and 
she quickly, for the moment at least, whisked 
away from the topic, demanding, apropos of com 
rades and visitors, what had become of Gabriel 
Nash, whom she had not encountered for so 
many days. 



832  

"I think he s tired of me," said Nick; "he 
has n t been near me, either. But, after all, it s 
natural he has seen me through." 

"Seen you through? Why, you ve only just 
begun." 

" Precisely, and at bottom he does n t like to 
see me begin. He s afraid I 11 do something." 

" Do you mean he s jealous ? " 

" Not in the least, for from the moment one 
does anything one ceases to compete with him. 
It leaves him the field more clear. But that s 
just the discomfort, for him he feels, as you 
said just now, kind of lonely ; he feels rather 
abandoned and even, I think, a little betrayed. 
So far from being jealous he yearns for me and 
regrets me. The only thing he really takes seri 
ously is to speculate and understand, to talk 
about the reasons and the essence of things : the 
people who do that are the highest. The appli 
cations, the consequences, the vulgar little effects, 
belong to a lower plane, to which one must doubt 
less be tolerant and indulgent, but which is after 
all an affair of comparative accidents and trifles. 
Indeed he 11 probably tell me frankly, the next 
time I see him, that he can t but feel that to 
come down to the little questions of action the 
little prudences and compromises and simplifica 
tions of practice is for the superior person a. 
really fatal descent. One may be inoffensive and 
even commendable after it, but one can scarcely 
pretend to be interesting. // en faut comme ga. 



 833 

but one does n t haunt them. He ll do his best 
for me ; he 11 come back again, but he 11 come 
back sad, and finally he 11 fade away altogether. 
He 11 go off to Granada, or somewhere." 

"The simplifications of practice?" cried Mir 
iam. "Why, they are just precisely the most 
blessed things on earth. What should we do 
without them ?" 

" What indeed ? " Nick echoed. " But if we 
need them, it s because we re not superior per 
sons. We re awful Philistines." 

" I 11 be one with you" the girl smiled. " Poor 
Nash is n t worth talking about. What was it 
but a little question of action when he preached 
to you, as I know he did, to give up your seat ? " 

" Yes, he has a weakness for giving up he 11 
go with you as far as that. But I m not giving 
up any more, you see. I m pegging away, and 
that s gross." 

"He s an idiot nen parlons plus!" Mir 
iam dropped, gathering up her parasol, but lin 
gering. 

" Ah, never for me ! He helped me at a diffi 
cult time." 

" You ought to be ashamed to confess it." 

" Oh, you are a Philistine," said Nick. 

" Certainly I am," Miriam returned, going 

toward the door, " if it makes me one to be sorry, 

awfully sorry and even rather angry, that I have n t 

before me a period of the same sort of unsociable 

pegging away that you have. For want of it I

shall never really be good. However, if you don t 
tell people I ve said so, they 11 never know. Your 
conditions are far better than mine and far more 
respectable : you can do as many things as you 
like, in patient obscurity, while I m pitchforked 
into the mefee, and into the most improbable fame, 
upon the back of a solitary cheval de bataille, a 
poor, broken-winded screw. I foresee that I shall 
be condemned for the greater part of the rest of 
my days (do you see that ?) to play the stuff I m 
acting now. I m studying Juliet and I want aw 
fully to do her, but really I m mortally afraid lest, 
if I should succeed, I should find myself in such 
a box. Perhaps they d want Juliet forever, instead 
of my present part. You see amid what delight 
ful alternatives one moves. What I want most 
I never shall have had five quiet years of hard, 
all-round work, in a perfect company, with a man 
ager more perfect still, playing five hundred parts 
and never being heard of. I may be too partic 
ular, but that s what I should have liked. I 
think I m disgusting, with my successful crudi 
ties. It s discouraging; it makes one not care 
much what happens. What s the use, in such 
an age, of being good ? " 

" Good ? Your haughty claim is that you re 
bad." 

" I mean good, you know there are other 
ways. Don t be stupid." And Nick s visitor 
tapped him he was at the door with her with 
her parasol. 



 835 

" I scarcely know what to say to you, for cer 
tainly it s your fault if you get on so fast." 
" I m too clever I m a humbug." 
" That s the way I used to be," said Nick. 
Miriam rested her wonderful eyes on him ; then 
she turned them over the room, slowly, after 
which she attached them again, kindly, musingly, 
on his own. " Ah, the pride of that the sense 
of purification ! He used to be forsooth ! Poor 
me ! Of course you 11 say : Look at the sort, of 
thing I ve undertaken to produce, compared with 
what you have. So it s all right. Become great 
in the proper way and don t expose me." She 
glanced back once more into the studio, as if she 
were leaving it forever, and gave another last 
look at the unfinished canvas on the easel. She 
shook her head sadly. " Poor Mr. Sherringham 
- with that ! " she murmured. 

"Oh, I ll finish it it will r^e very decent," 
said Nick. 

" Finish it by yourself ? " 

" Not necessarily. You 11 come back and sit 
when you return to London." 

"Never, never, never again." 

Nick stared. " Why, you ve made me the most 
profuse offers and promises." 

" Yes, but they were made in ignorance, and 
I ve backed out of them. I m capricious too 
faites la part de fa. I see it would n t do I 
didn t know it then. We re too far apart I 
am, as you say, a Philistine." And as Nick pro- 



836  

tested with vehemence against this unscrupulous 
bad faith, she added, " You 11 find other models ; 
paint Gabriel Nash." 

" Gabriel Nash as a substitute for you ? " 

" It will be a good way to get rid of him. Paint 
Mrs. Dallow, too," Miriam went on, as she passed 
out of the door which Nick had opened for her 
" paint Mrs. Dallow, if you wish to eradicate the 
last possibility of a throb." 

It was strange that since only a moment be 
fore Nick had been in a state of mind to which 
the superfluity of this reference would have been 
the clearest thing about it, he should now have 
been moved to receive it, quickly, naturally, irre- 
flectively, with the question : " The last possibil 
ity ? Do you mean in her or in me ? " 

" Oh, in you. I don t know anything about 
her." 

"But that wouldn t be the effect," rejoined 
Nick, with the same supervening candor. " I 
believe that if she were to sit to me the usual law 
would be reversed." 

" The usual law ? " 

" Which you cited awhile since and of which I 
recognized the general truth. In the case you 
speak of I should probably make a frightful pic 
ture." 

" And fall in love with her again ? Then, for 
God s sake, risk the daub ! " Miriam laughed out, 
floating away to her victoria. 



XLIX. 

MIRIAM had guessed happily in saying to Nick 
that to offer to paint Gabriel Nash would be the 
way to get rid of him. It was with no such in 
vidious purpose indeed that our young man pro 
posed to his intermittent friend to sit ; rather, as 
August was dusty in the London streets, he had 
too little hope that Nash would remain in town at 
such a time to oblige him. Nick had no wish to 
get rid of his private philosopher ; he liked his 
philosophy, and though of course premeditated 
paradox was the light to read him by, yet he had 
frequently, in detail, an inspired unexpectedness. 
He remained, in Rosedale Road, the man in the 
world who had most the quality of company. All 
the other men of Nick s acquaintance, all his po 
litical friends, represented, often very communi 
catively, their own affairs, and their own affairs 
alone ; which, when they did it well, was the most 
their host could ask them. But Nash had the 
rare distinction that he seemed somehow to stand 
for his affairs, the said host s, with an interest in 
them unaffected by the ordinary social limitations 
of capacity. This relegated him to the class of 
high luxuries, and Nick was well aware that we 
hold our luxuries by a fitful and precarious tenure. 



838  

If a friend without personal eagerness was one of 
the greatest of these, it would be evident to the 
simplest mind that by the law of distribution of 
earthly boons such a convenience should be ex 
pected to forfeit in duration what it displayed in 
intensity. He had never been without a suspi 
cion that Nash was too good to last, though, for 
that matter, nothing had happened to confirm a 
vague apprehension that the particular way he 
would break up, or break down, would be by wish 
ing to put Nick in relation with his other disci 
ples. 

That would practically amount to a catastrophe, 
Nick felt ; for it was odd that one could both 
have a great kindness for him and not in the 
least, when it came to the point, yearn for a view 
of his belongings. His originality had always 
been that he appeared to have none ; and if in the 
first instance he had introduced Nick to Miriam 
and her mother, that was an exception for which 
Peter Sherringham s interference had been in a 
great measure responsible. All the same, how 
ever, it was some time before Nick ceased to 
think it might eventually very well happen that 
to complete his education, as it were, Gabriel 
would wish him to foregather a little with minds 
formed by the same mystical influence. Nick 
had an instinct, in which there was no conscious 
ness of detriment to Nash, that the pupils, per 
haps even the imitators, of such a genius would 
be, as he mentally phrased it, something awful. 



 839 

He could be sure, even Gabriel himself could be 
sure, of his own reservations, but how could 
either of them be sure of those of others ? Imita 
tion is a fortunate homage only in proportion as 
it is delicate, and there was an indefinable some 
thing in Nash s doctrine that would have been 
discredited by exaggeration or by zeal. Provi 
dence, happily, appeared to have spared it this 
exposure ; so that, after months, Nick had to re 
mind himself that his friend had never pressed 
upon his attention the least little group of fellow- 
mystics, nor offered to produce them for his edifi 
cation. It scarcely mattered now that he was 
just the man to whom the superficial would at 
tribute that sort of tail : it would probably have 
been hard, for example, to persuade Lady Agnes, 
or Julia Dallow, or Peter Sherringham, that he 
was not most at home in some dusky, untidy, 
dimly-imagined suburb of " culture," peopled by 
unpleasant phrasemongers who thought him a 
gentleman and who had no human use but to be 
held up in the comic press, which was probably 
restrained by decorum from touching upon the 
worst of their aberrations. 

Nick, at any rate, never discovered his acad 
emy, nor the suburb in question ; never caught 
from the impenetrable background of his life 
the least reverberation of flitting or flirting, the 
smallest aesthetic ululation. There were mo 
ments when he was even moved to a degree of 
pity by the silence that poor Gabriel s own faculty 



840  

of sound made around him when at least it 
qualified with a slight poorness the mystery he 
could never wholly dissociate from him, the sense 
of the transient and occasional, the likeness to 
vapor or murmuring wind or shifting light. It 
was, for instance, a symbol of this unclassified 
condition, the lack of all position as a name in 
well-kept books, that Nick in point of fact had 
no idea where he lived, would not have known 
how to go and see him or send him a doctor if he 
had heard he was ill. He had never walked with 
him to any, door of Gabriel s own, even to pause 
at the threshold, though indeed Nash had a club, 
the Anonymous, in some improbable square, of 
which Nick suspected him of being the only 
member he had never heard of another 
where it was vaguely understood that letters 
would some day or other find him. Fortunately 
it was not necessary to worry about him, so com 
fortably his whole aspect seemed to imply that 
he could never be ill. And this was not, per 
haps, because his bloom was healthy, but because 
it was morbid, as if he had been universally inoc 
ulated. 

He turned up in Rosedale Road one day, after 
Miriam had left London ; he had just come back 
from a fortnight in Brittany, where he had drawn 
unusual refreshment from the subtle sadness of 
the landscape. He was on his way somewhere 
else ; he was going abroad for the autumn, but 
he was not particular what he did, professing that 



 84! 

he had returned to London on purpose to take 
one last superintending look at Nick. " It s very 
nice, it s very nice ; yes, yes, I see," he remarked, 
giving a little general assenting sigh as his eyes 
wandered over the simple scene a sigh which, 
to a suspicious ear, would have testified to an 
insidious reaction. 

Nick s ear, as we know, was already suspicious ; 
a fact which would sufficiently account for the 
expectant smile (it indicated the pleasant appre 
hension of a theory confirmed) with which he in 
quired : " Do you mean my pictures are nice ? " 

" Yes, yes, your pictures and the whole thing." 

"The whole thing?" 

" Your existence here, in this little remote in 
dependent corner of the great city. The disin 
terestedness of your attitude, the persistence of 
your effort, the piety, the beauty, in short the 
example of the whole spectacle." 

Nick broke into a laugh. " How near to hav 
ing had enough of me you. must be when you 
talk of my example ! " Nash changed color 
slightly at this ; it was the first time in Nick s 
remembrance that he had given a sign of embar 
rassment. " Vons allez me lacker, I see it com 
ing ; and who can blame you ? for I ve ceased 
to be in the least spectacular. I had my little 
hour ; it was a great deal, for some people don t 
even have that. I ve given you your curious 
case, and I ve been generous ; I made the drama 
last, for you, as long as I could. You 11 slope/ 



842  

my dear fellow, you 11 quietly slope ; and it will 
be all right and inevitable, though I shall miss 
you greatly at first. Who knows whether, with 
out you, I should n t still have been representing 
Harsh, heaven help me? You rescued me; you 
converted me from a representative into an ex 
ample that s a shade better. But don t I know 
where you must be when you re reduced to prais 
ing my piety ? " 

" Don t turn me away," said Nash plaintively ; 
" give me a cigarette." 

" I shall never dream of turning you away ; I 
shall cherish you till the latest possible hour. 
I m only trying to keep myself in tune with the 
logic of things. The proof of how I cling is that, 
precisely, I want you to sit to me." 

" To sit to you ? " Nick thought his visitor 
looked a little blank. 

" Certainly, for after all it is n t much to ask. 
Here we are, and the hour is peculiarly pro 
pitious long light days, with no one coming 
near me, so that I have plenty of time. I had a 
hope I should have some orders : my younger 
sister, whom you know and who is a great opti 
mist, plied me with that vision. In fact, we in 
vented together a charming sordid little theory 
that there might be rather a run on me, from 
the chatter (such as it was) produced by my tak 
ing up this line. My sister struck out the idea 
that a good many of the pretty ladies would think 
me interesting, would want to be done. Perhaps 



 843 

they do, but they ve controlled themselves, for I 
can t say the run has commenced. They have n t 
even come to look, but I dare say they don t yet 
quite take it in. Of course it s a bad time, with 
every one out of town ; though you know they 
might send for me to come and do them at home. 
Perhaps they will, when they settle down. A 
portrait-tour of a dozen country-houses, for the 
autumn and winter what do you say to that 
for a superior programme ? I know I excruciate 
you," Nick added, "but don t you see how it s 
my interest to try how much you 11 still stand ? " 

Gabriel puffed his cigarette with a serenity so 
perfect that it might have been assumed to falsify 
Nick s words. " Mrs. Dallow will send for you 
vons allez voir $a," he said in a moment, brush 
ing aside all vagueness. 

" She 11 send for me ? " 

" To paint her portrait ; she 11 recapture you 
on that basis. She 11 get you down to one of the 
country-houses, and it will all go off as charm 
ingly with sketching in the morning, on days 
you can t hunt, and anything you like in the 
afternoon, and fifteen courses in the evening ; 
there 11 be bishops and ambassadors staying 
as if you were a well-known awfully clever 
amateur. Take care, take care, for, fickle as 
you may think me, I can read the future : don t 
imagine you ve come to the end of me yet. Mrs. 
Dallow and your sister, of both of whom I speak 
with the greatest respect, are capable of hatch- 



844  

ing together the most conscientious, delightful 
plan for you. Your differences with the beauti 
ful lady will be patched up and you 11 each come 
round a little and meet the other half-way. Mrs. 
Dallow will swallow your profession if you 11 
swallow hers. She 11 put up with the palette if 
you 11 put up with the country-house. It will be 
a very unusual one in which you won t find a 
good north room where you can paint. You 11 
go about with her and do all her friends, all the 
bishops and ambassadors, and you 11 eat your 
cake and have it, and every one, beginning with 
your wife, will forget there s anything queer 
about you, and everything will be for the best in 
the best of worlds ; so that, together you and 
she you 11 become a great social institution 
and every one will think she has a delightful 
husband ; to say nothing, of course, of your hav 
ing a delightful wife. Ah, my dear fellow, you 
turn pale, and with reason ! " Nash went on : 
" that s to pay you for having tried to make me 
let you have it. You have it, then, there ! I 
may be a bore" -the emphasis of this, though 
a mere shade, testified to the first personal re 
sentment Nick had ever heard his visitor express 
"I may be a bore, but once in a while I strike 
a light, I make things out. Then I venture to 
repeat, * Take care, take care. If, as I say, I 
respect those ladies infinitely, it is because they 
will be acting according to the highest wisdom 
of their sex. That s the sort of thins: women 



 845 

invent when they re exceptionally good and 
clever. When they re not they don t do so 
well ; but it s not for want of trying. There s 
only one thing in the world that s better than 
their charm : it s their conscience. That indeed 
is a part of their charm. And when they club 
together, when they earnestly consider, as in the 
case we re supposing," Nash continued, "then 
the whole thing takes a lift ; for it s no longer 
the conscience of the individual, it s that of the 
sex." 

" You re so remarkable that, more than ever, 
I must paint you," Nick returned, " though I m 
so agitated by your prophetic words that my hand 
trembles and I shall doubtless scarcely be able 
to hold my brush. Look how I rattle my easel 
trying to put it into position. I see it all there, 
just as you say it. Yes, it will be a droll day, 
and more modern than anything yet, when the 
conscience of women perceives objections to 
men s being in love with them. You talk of their 
goodness and cleverness, and it s much to the 
point. I don t know what else they themselves 
might do with these things, but I don t see what 
men can do with them but be fond of them." 

" Oh, you 11 do it you 11 do it ! " cried Nash, 
brightly jubilant. 

" What is it I shall do ? " 

" Exactly what I just said; if not next year, 
then the year after, or the year after that. You 11 
go half - way to meet her, and she 11 drag you 



846  

about and pass you off. You 11 paint the bishops 
and become a social institution. That is, you will 
if you don t take great care." 

" I shall, no doubt, and that s why I cling to 
you. You must still look after me ; don t melt 
away into a mere improbable reminiscence, a de 
lightful symbolic fable don t, if you can pos 
sibly help it. The trouble is, you see, that you 
can t really keep hold very tight, because at bot 
tom it will amuse you much more to see me in 
another pickle than to find me simply jogging 
down the vista of the years on the straight 
course. Let me, at any rate, have some sort of 
sketch of you, as a kind of feather from the an 
gel s wing or a photograph of the ghost, to prove 
to me in the future that you were once a solid, 
sociable fact, that I did n t invent you, launch you 
as a hoax. Of course I shall be able to say to 
myself that you can t have been a fable other 
wise you would have a moral ; but that won t be 
enough, because I m not sure you won t have 
had one. Some day you 11 peep in here lan 
guidly and find me in such an attitude of piety 
presenting my bent back to you as I niggle over 
some interminable botch that I shall give 
cruelly on your nerves, and you 11 draw away, 
closing the door softly (for you 11 be gentle and 
considerate about it and spare me you won t 
even make me look round), and steal off on tiptoe, 
never, never to return." 

Gabriel consented to sit ; he professed he 



 847 

should enjoy it and be glad to give up for it his 
immediate Continental projects, so vague to Nick, 
so definite, apparently, to himself ; and he came 
back three times for the purpose. Nick promised 
himself a great deal of interest from this experi 
ment ; for from the first hour he began to feel 
that really, as yet, compared to the scrutiny to 
which he now subjected him, he had never, with 
any intensity, looked at his friend. His impres 
sion had been that Nash had a head quite fine 
enough to be a challenge, and that as he sat 
there, day by day, all sorts of pleasant and paint- 
able things would come out in his face. This 
impression was not falsified, bu.t the whole prob 
lem became more complicated. It struck our 
young man that he had never seen his subject be 
fore, and yet, somehow, this revelation was not 
produced by the sense of actually seeing it. 
What was revealed was the difficulty what he 
saw was the indefinite and the elusive. He had 
taken things for granted which literally were not 
there, and he found things there (except that he 
could n t catch them) which he had not hitherto 
counted in. This baffling effect, being eminently 
in Nash s line, might have been the result of his 
whimsical volition, had it not appeared to Nick, 
after a few hours of the job, that his sitter was 
not the one who enjoyed it most. He was un 
comfortable, at first vaguely and then definitely 
so silent, restless, gloomy, dim, as if, when it 
came to the test, it proved less of a pleasure to 



848  

him than he could have had an idea of in ad 
vance to be infinitely examined and handled, 
sounded and sifted. He had been willing to try 
it, in good faith ; but frankly he did n t like it. 
He was not cross, but he was clearly unhappy, 
and Nick had never heard him say so little, seen 
him give so little. 

Nick felt, accordingly, as if he had laid a trap 
for him ; he asked himself if it were really fair. 
At the same time there was something fascinat 
ing in the oddity of such a relation between the 
subject and the artist, and Nick was disposed to 
go on until he should have to stop for very pity. 
He caught, eventually, a glimmer of the truth 
that lay at the bottom of this anomaly ; guessed 
that what made his friend uncomfortable was 
simply the reversal, in such a combination, of his 
usual terms of intercourse. He was so accus 
tomed to living upon irony and the interpretation 
I things that it was strange to him to be himself 
interpreted, and (as a gentleman who sits for his 
portrait is always liable to be) interpreted ironi 
cally. From being outside of the universe he 
was suddenly brought into it, and from the posi 
tion of a free commentator and critic, a sort of 
amateurish editor, of the whole affair, reduced to 
that of humble ingredient and contributor. It 
occurred afterwards to Nick that he had perhaps 
brought on a catastrophe by having happened to 
say to his companion, in the course of their dis 
jointed pauses, and not only without any cruel 



 849 

intention, but with an impulse of genuine solici 
tude : " But, my dear fellow, what will you do 
when you re old ? " 

" Old ? What do you call old ? " Nash had re 
plied bravely enough, but with another percep 
tible tinge of irritation. " Must I really inform 
you, at this time of day, that that term has no 
application to such a condition as mine ? It only 
belongs to you wretched people who have the in 
curable superstition of doing ; it s the ignoble 
collapse you prepare for yourselves when you 
cease to be able to do. For me there 11 be no 
collapse, no transition, no clumsy readjustment 
of attitude ; for I shall only be, more and more, 
with all the accumulations of experience, the 
longer I live." 

" Oh, I m not particular about the term," said 
Nick. "If you don t call it old, the ultimate 
state, call it weary call it exhausted. The ac 
cumulations of experience are practically accumu 
lations of fatigue." 

" I don t know anything about weariness. I 
live freshly it does n t fatigue me." 

"Then you need never die," rejoined Nick. 

" Certainly ; I dare say I m eternal." 

Nick laughed out at this it would be such 
fine news to some people. Rut it was uttered 
with perfect gravity, and it might very well have 
been in the spirit of that gravity that Nash failed 
to observe his agreement to sit again the next 
day. The next and the next and the next passed, 
but he never came back. 



850  

True enough, punctuality was not important 
for a man who felt that he had the command of 
all time. Nevertheless, his disappearance, "with 
out a trace," like a personage in a fairy-tale or a 
melodrama, made a considerable impression on 
his friend as the months went on ; so that, 
though he had never before had the least difficulty 
about entering into the play of Gabriel s humor, 
Nick now recalled with a certain fanciful awe the 
unusual seriousness with which he had ranked 
himself among imperishable things. He won 
dered a little whether he had at last gone quite 
mad. He had never before had such a literal air, 
and he would have had to be mad to be so com 
monplace. Perhaps indeed he was acting only 
more than usual in his customary spirit thought 
fully contributing, for Nick s enlivenment, a mys 
tery to an horizon now grown unromantic. The 
mystery, at any rate, remained ; another too came 
near being added to it. Nick had the prospect, 
for the future, of the harmless excitement of 
waiting to see when Nash would turn up, if ever, 
and the further diversion (it almost consoled him 
for the annoyance of being left with a second un 
finished portrait on his hands) of imagining that 
the picture he had begun had a singular air of 
gradually fading from the canvas. He could n t 
catch it in the act, but he could have a suspicion, 
when he glanced at it, that the hand of time was 
rubbing it away little by little (for all the world 
as in some delicate Hawthorne tale), making the 



 851 

surface indistinct and bare bare of all resem 
blance to the model. Of course the moral of the 
Hawthorne tale would be that this personage 
would come back on the day when the last adum 
bration should have vanished. 



ONE day, toward the end of March of the fol 
lowing year, or in other words more than six 
months after the incident I have last had occasion 
to narrate, Bridget Dormer came into her broth 
er s studio and greeted him with the effusion that 
accompanies a return from an absence. She had 
been staying at Broadwood she had been stay 
ing at Harsh. She had various things to tell him 
about these episodes, about his mother, about 
Grace, about herself, and about Percy s having 
come, just before, over to Broadwood for two 
days ; the longest visit with which, almost since 
they could remember, the head of the family had 
honored Lady Agnes. Nick noted, however, 
that it had apparently been taken as a great favor, 
and Biddy loyally testified to the fact that her 
elder brother was awfully jolly and that his pres 
ence had been a pretext for tremendous fun. 
Nick asked her what had passed about his mar 
riage what their mother had said to him. 

" Oh, nothing," Biddy replied ; and he had said 
nothing to Lady Agnes and not a word to her 
self. This partly explained, for Nick, the awful 
jollity and the tremendous fun none but cheer 
ful topics had been produced ; but he questioned 



 853 

his sister further, to a point which led her to say : 
" Oh, I dare say that before long she 11 write to 
her." 

" Who 11 write to whom ? " 

" Mamma 11 write to his wife. I m sure he d 
like it. Of course we shall end by going to see 
her. He was awfully disappointed at what he 
found in Spain he did n t find anything." 

Biddy spoke of his disappointment almost with 
commiseration, for she was evidently inclined 
this morning to a fresh and kindly view of things. 
Nick could share her feeling only so far as was 
permitted by a recognition merely general of 
what his brother must have looked for. It might 
have been snipe and it might have been bristling 
boars. Biddy was indeed brief, at first, about 
everything, in spite of the two months that had 
intervened since their last meeting ; for he saw in 
a few minutes that she had something behind 
something that made her gay and that she wanted 
to come to quickly. Nick was vaguely vexed at 
her being, fresh from Broadwood, so gay as that ; 
for (it was impossible to shut one s eyes to it) 
what had come to pass in practice in regard to 
that rural retreat was exactly what he had desired 
to avert. All winter, while it had been taken for 
granted that his mother and sisters were doing 
what he wished, they had been doing the precise 
contrary. He held Biddy perhaps least responsi 
ble, and there was no one he could exclusively 
blame. He washed his hands of the matter and 



854  

succeeded fairly well, for the most part, in forget 
ting that he was not pleased. Julia Dallow her 
self in fact appeared to have been the most active 
member of the little group united to make light 
of his scruples. There had been a formal restitu 
tion of the place, but the three ladies were there 
more than ever, with the slight difference that 
they were mainly there with its mistress. Maho 
met had declined to go any more to the mountain, 
so the mountain had virtually gone to Mahomet. 

After their long visit in the autumn Lady 
Agnes and her girls had come back to town ; but 
they had gone down again for Christmas and 
Julia had taken this occasion to write to Nick 
that she hoped very much he wouldn t refuse 
them all his own company for just a little scrap 
of the supremely sociable time. Nick, after reflec 
tion, judged it best not to refuse, and he spent 
three days under Mrs. Dallow s roof. The "all " 
proved a great many people, for she had taken 
care to fill the house. She was a magnificent en 
tertainer, and Nick had never seen her so splen 
did, so free-handed, so gracefully practical. She 
was a perfect mistress of the revels ; she had or 
ganized something festive for every day and for 
every night. The Dormers were so much in it, 
as the phrase was, that after all their discomfiture 
their fortune seemed in an hour to have come 
back. There had been a moment when, in ex 
temporized charades, Lady Agnes, an elderly fig 
ure being required, appeared on the point of un- 



 855 

dertaking the part of the housekeeper at a castle, 
who, dropping her /z s, showed sheeplike tourists 
about ; but she waived the opportunity in favor 
of her daughter Grace. Even Grace had a great 
success. Nick of course was in the charades and 
in everything, but Julia was not ; she only in 
vented, directed, led the applause. When no 
thing else was going on Nick " sketched " the 
whole company : they followed him about, they 
waylaid him on staircases, clamoring to be allowed 
to sit. He obliged them, so far as he could, 
all save Julia, who did n t clamor ; and, growing 
rather red, he thought of Gabriel Nash while he 
bent over the paper. Early in the new year he 
went abroad for six weeks, but only as far as 
Paris. It was a new Paris for him then : a Paris 
of the Rue Bonaparte and three or four profes 
sional friends (he had more of these there than 
in London) ; a Paris of studios and studies and 
models, of researches and revelations, compari 
sons and contrasts, of strong impressions and 
long discussions and rather uncomfortable econo 
mies, small cafes and bad fires and the general 
sense of being twenty again. 

While he was away his mother and sisters 
(Lady Agnes now sometimes wrote to him) re 
turned to London for a month, and before he 
was again established in Rosedale Road they 
went back, for a third period, to Broadwood. 
After they had been there five days and this 
was the salt of the whole dish Julia took her- 



856  

self off to Hars-h, leaving them in undisturbed 
possession. They had remained so ; they would 
not come up to town till after Easter. The trick 
was played, and Biddy, as I have mentioned, was 
now very content. Her brother presently learned, 
however, that the reason of this was not wholly 
the success of the trick ; unless indeed her 
further ground were only a continuation of it. 
She was not in London as a forerunner of her 
mother ; she was not even as yet in Calcutta 
Gardens. She had come to spend a week with 
Florence Tressilian, who had lately taken the 
dearest little flat in a charming new place, just 
put up, on the other side of the Park, with all 
kinds of lifts and tubes and electricities. Flor 
ence had been awfully nice to her she had 
been with them ever so long at Broadwood, while 
the flat was being painted and prepared and 
mamma had then let her, let Biddy, promise to 
come to her, when everything was ready, so that 
they might have a kind of old maids house-warm 
ing together. If Florence could do without a 
chaperon now (she had two latchkeys and went 
alone on the top of omnibuses, and her name was 
in the Red Book), she was enough of a duenna for 
another girl. Biddy alluded with sweet cynical 
eyes to the fine, happy stride she had thus taken 
in the direction of enlightened spinsterhood ; and 
Nick hung his head, somewhat abashed and hu 
miliated, for, modern as he had supposed himself, 
there were evidently currents more modern yet. 



 857 

It so happened that on this particular morning 
Nick had drawn out of a corner his interrupted 
study of Gabriel Nash ; for no purpose more defi 
nite (he had only been looking round the room 
in a rummaging spirit) than to see curiously how 
much or how little of it remained. It had be 
come, to his apprehension, such a shadowy affair 
(he was sure of this, and it made him laugh) that 
it did n t seem worth putting away, and he left it 
leaning against a table as if it had been a blank 
canvas or a " preparation " to be painted over. 
In this attitude it attracted Biddy s attention, for 
to her, on a second glance, it had distinguishable 
features. She had not seen it before, and she 
asked whom it might represent, remarking also 
that she could almost guess, but not quite : she had 
known the original, but she could n t name him. 

" Six months ago, for a few days, it represented 
Gabriel Nash," Nick replied. " But it is n t any 
body or anything now." 

" Six months ago ? What s the matter with 
it and why don t you go on ? " 

" What s the matter with it is more than I can 
tell you. But I can t go on, because I ve lost 
my model." 

Biddy stared an instant. " Is he dead ? " 

Her brother laughed out at the candid cheer 
fulness, hopefulness almost, with which this in 
quiry broke from her. " He s only dead to me. 
He has gone away." 

" Where has he gone?" 



858  

" I have n t the least idea." 

" Why, have you quarreled ? " Biddy asked. 

" Quarreled ? For what do you take us ? Does 
the nightingale quarrel with the moon ?" 

" I need n t ask which of you is the moon," 
said Biddy. 

" Of course I m the nightingale. But, more 
literally," Nick continued, " Nash has melted 
back into the elements he is part of the ambi 
ent air." Then, as even with this literalness he 
saw that his sister was mystified, he added : " I 
have a notion he has gone to India and at the 
present moment is reclining on a bank of flowers 
in the vale of Cashmere." 

Biddy was silent a minute, after which she 
dropped: "Julia will be glad she dislikes him 
so." 

" If she dislikes him, why should she be glad 
he s in such a delightful situation ? " 

" I mean about his going away ; she 11 be glad 
of that." 

" My poor child, what has Julia to do with it ?" 

" She has more to do with things than you 
think," Biddy replied, with some eagerness ; but 
she had no sooner uttered the words than she 
perceptibly blushed. Hereupon, to attenuate the 
foolishness of her blush (only it had the opposite 
effect), she added : " She thinks he has been a 
bad element in your life." 

Nick shook his head, smiling. " She thinks, 
perhaps, but she does n t think enough ; other- 



 859 

wise, she would arrive at this better thought 
that she knows nothing whatever about my life." 

"Ah, Nick," the girl pleaded, with solemn eyes, 
"you don t imagine what an interest she takes 
in it. She has told me, many times she has 
talked lots to me about it." Biddy paused, and 
then went on, with an anxious little smile shin 
ing through her gravity, as if she were trying, 
cautiously, how much her brother would take : 
She has a conviction that it was Mr. Nash who 
made trouble between you." 

"My dear Biddy," Nick rejoined, "those are 
thoroughly second-rate ideas, the result of a per 
fectly superficial view. Excuse my possibly prig 
gish tone, but they really attribute to Nash a 
part he s quite incapable of playing. He can 
neither make trouble nor take trouble ; no trouble 
could ever either have come out of him or have 
gone into him. Moreover," our young man con 
tinued, "if Julia has talked to you so much about 
the matter there s no harm in my talking to you 
a little. When she threw me over in an hour it 
was on a perfectly definite occasion. That occa 
sion was the presence in my studio of a dishev 
eled actress." 

"Oh, Nick, she has not thrown you over!" 
Biddy protested. " She has not I have proof." 

Nick felt, at this direct denial, a certain stir of 
indignation, and he looked at his sister with mo 
mentary sternness. " Has she sent you here to 
tell me this ? What do you mean by the proof ? " 



S60  

Biddy s eyes, at these questions, met her 
brother s with a strange expression, and for a 
few seconds, while she looked entreatingly into 
his own, she wavered there, with parted lips, 
vaguely stretching out her hands. The next 
minute she had burst into tears she was sob 
bing on his breast. He said " Hallo ! " and 
soothed her ; but it was very quickly over. Then 
she told him what she meant by her " proof," 
and what she had had on her mind ever since 
she came into the room. It was a message from 
Julia, but not to say not to say what he had 
asked her just before if she meant ; though in 
deed Biddy, more familiar now, since her brother 
had had his arm round her, boldly expressed the 
hope that it might in the end come to the same 
thing. Julia simply wanted to know (she had in 
structed Biddy to sound him, discreetly) if Nick 
would undertake her portrait ; and the girl wound 
up this experiment in " sounding " by the state 
ment that their beautiful kinswoman was dying 
to sit. 

"Dying to sit?" repeated Nick, whose turn 
it was, this time, to feel his color rise. 

"Any time you like, after Easter, when she 
comes up to town. She wants a full-length, and 
your very best, your most splendid work." 

Nick stared, not caring that he had blushed. 
" Is she serious ? " 

" Ah, Nick serious ! " Biddy reasoned ten 
derly. She came nearer to him, and he thought 



 86 1 

she was going to weep again. He took her by 
the shoulders, looking into her eyes. 

" It s all right, if she knows / am. But why 
does n t she come like any one else ? I don t re 
fuse people ! " 

" Nick, dearest Nick ! " she went on, with her 
eyes conscious and pleading. He looked into 
them intently as well as she he could play at 
sounding - and for a moment, between these 
young persons, the air was lighted by the glim 
mer of mutual searchings and suppressed confes 
sions. Nick read deep and then, suddenly releas 
ing his sister, turned away. She didn t see his 
face in that movement, but an observer to whom 
it had been presented might have fancied that it 
denoted a foreboding which was not exactly a 
dread, yet was not exclusively a joy. 

The first thing Nick made out in the room, 
when he could distinguish, was Gabriel Nash s 
portrait, which immediately filled him with an 
unreasoning resentment. He seized it and 
turned it about ; he jammed it back into its cor 
ner, with its face against the wall. This bus 
tling transaction might have served to carry off 
the embarrassment with which he had finally 
averted himself from Biddy. The embarrass 
ment, however, was all his own ; none of it was 
reflected in the way Biddy resumed, after a si 
lence in which she had followed his disposal of 
the picture : 

" If she s so eager to come here (for it s here 



862  

that she wants to sit, not in Great Stanhope 
Street never !), how can she prove better that 
she does n t care a bit if she meets Miss 
Rooth ? " 

" She won t meet Miss Rooth," Nick replied, 
rather dryly. 

" Oh, I m sorry ! " said Biddy. She was as 
frank as if she had achieved a sort of victory over 
her companion ; and she seemed to regret the 
loss of a chance for Mrs. Dallow to show mag 
nanimity. Her tone made her brother laugh, 
but she went on, with confidence : " She thought 
it was Mr. Nash who made Miss Rooth come." 

" So he did, by the way," said Nick. 

"Well, then, was n t that making trouble?" 

" I thought you admitted there was no harm 
in her being here." 

" Yes, but he hoped there would be." 

" Poor Nash s hopes ! " Nick laughed. " My 
dear child, it would take a cleverer head than you 
or me, or even Julia, who must have invented 
that wise theory, to say what they were. How 
ever, let us agree that even if they were perfectly 
devilish my good sense has been a match for 
them." 

" Oh, Nick, that s delightful ! " chanted Biddy. 
Then she added: " Do you mean she doesn t 
come any more ? " 

" The disheveled actress ? She has n t been 
near me for months." 

" But she s in London she s always acting ? 



 863 

I ve been away so much I ve scarcely observed," 
Biddy explained, with a slight change of note. 

"The same part, poor creature, for nearly a 
year. It appears that that s success, in her pro 
fession. I saw her in the character several 
times last summer, but I haven t set foot in her 
theatre since." 

Biddy was silent a moment ; then she sug 
gested, " Peter wouldn t have liked that." 

" Oh, Peter s likes ! " sighed Nick, at his easel, 
beginning to work. 

" I mean her acting the same part for a year." 

" I m sure I don t know ; he has never written 
me a word." 

" Nor me either," Biddy returned. 

There was another short silence, during which 
Nick brushed at a panel. It was terminated by 
his presently saying : " There s one thing, cer 
tainly, Peter would like that is, simply to be 
here to-night. It s a great night another 
great night for the disheveled one. She s to 
act Juliet for the first time." 

" Ah, how I should like to see her ! " the girl 
cried. 

Nick glanced at her ; she sat watching him. 
" She has sent me a stall ; I wish she had sent 
me two. I should have been delighted to take 
you." 

" Don t you think you could get another ? " 
asked Biddy. 

"They must be in tremendous demand. But 



864  

who knows, after all ? " Nick added, at the same 
moment, looking round. " Here s a chance 
here s a quite extraordinary chance ! " 

His servant had opened the door and was ush 
ering in a lady whose identity was indeed justly 
indicated in those words. " Miss Rooth ! " the 
man announced ; but he was caught up by a gen 
tleman who came next and who exclaimed, laugh 
ing and with a gesture gracefully corrective : 
" No, no no longer Miss Rooth ! " 

Miriam entered the place with her charming 
familiar grandeur, as she might have appeared, as 
she appeared every night, early in her first act, 
at the back of the stage, by the immemorial cen 
tral door, presenting herself to the house, taking 
easy possession, repeating old movements, look 
ing from one to the other of the actors before the 
footlights. The rich " Good-morning " that she 
threw into the air, holding out her right hand to 
Biddy Dormer and then giving her left to Nick 
(as she might have given it to her own brother), 
had nothing to tell of intervals or alienations. 
She struck Biddy as still more terrible, in her 
splendid practice, than when she had seen her 
before the practice and the splendor had now 
something almost royal. The girl had had occa 
sion to make her courtesy to majesties and high 
nesses, but the flutter those effigies produced 
was nothing to the way in which, at the approach 
of this young lady, the agitated air seemed to 
recognize something supreme. So the deep, 



 865 

mild eyes that she bent upon Biddy were not 
soothing, though they were evidently intended to 
soothe. The girl wondered that Nick could 
have got so used to her (he joked at her as she 
came), and later in the day, still under the great 
impression of this incident, she even wondered 
that Peter could. It was true that Peter appar 
ently had n t got used to her. 

"You never came you never came," said 
Miriam to Biddy, kindly, sadly ; and Biddy, rec 
ognizing the allusion, the invitation to visit the 
actress at home, had to explain how much she 
had been absent from London and then even 
that her brother had n t proposed to take her. 
" Very true he has n t come himself. What is 
he doing now ? " Miriam asked, standing near 
Biddy but looking at Nick, who had immediately 
engaged in conversation with his other visitor, a 
gentleman whose face came back to the girl. 
She had seen this gentleman on the stage with 
Miss Rooth that was it, the night Peter took 
her to the theatre with Florence Tressilian. Oh, 
that Nick would only do something of that sort 
now ! This desire, quickened by the presence 
of the strange, expressive woman, by the way she 
scattered sweet syllables as if she were touching 
the piano-keys, combined with other things to 
make Biddy s head swin other things too min 
gled to name, admiration and fear and dim divi 
nation and purposeless pride and curiosity and 
resistance, the impulse to go away and the deter- 



866  

mination not to go. The actress courted her 
with her voice (what was the matter with her and 
what did she want ?), and Biddy tried in return to 
give an idea of what Nick was doing. Not suc 
ceeding very well, she was going to appeal to her 
brother, but Miriam stopped her, saying it did n t 
matter ; besides, Dashwood was telling Nick 
something something they wanted him to 
know. "We re in a great excitement he has 
taken a theatre," Miriam added. 

" Taken a theatre ? " Biddy was vague. 

"We re going to set up for ourselves. He s 
going to do for me altogether. It has all been 
arranged only within a day or two. It remains 
to be seen how it will answer," Miriam smiled. 
Biddy murmured some friendly hope, and her in 
terlocutress went on : " Do you know why I Ve 
broken in here to-day, after a long absence in 
terrupting your poor brother, taking up his pre 
cious time ? It s because I m so nervous." 

" About your first night ? " Biddy risked. 

" Do you know about that are you com 
ing? " Miriam asked quickly. 

" No, I m not coming I have n t a place." 

" Will you come if I send you one ? " 

"Oh, but really, it s too beautiful of you!" 
stammered the girl. 

" You shall have a box ; your brother shall 
bring you. You can t squeeze in a pin, I m told ; 
but I ve kept a box, I 11 manage it. Only, if 
I do, you know, mind you come ! " Miriam 



 867 

exclaimed, in suppliance, resting her hand on 
Biddy s. 

" Don t be afraid. And may I bring a friend 
the friend with whom I m staying ? " 

Miriam looked at her. " Do you mean Mrs. 
Dallow?" 

" No, no Miss Tressilian. She puts me up, 
she has got a flat. Did you ever see a flat ? " 
asked Biddy expansively. " My cousin s not in 
London." Miriam replied that she might bring 
whom she liked, and Biddy broke out, to her 
brother, " Fancy what kindness, Nick : we re to 
have a box to-night and you re to take me ! " 

Nick turned to her, smiling, with an expression 
in his face which struck her even at the time as 
odd but which she understood when the sense of 
it recurred to her later. Mr. Dashwood inter 
posed with the remark that it was all very well to 
talk about boxes, but that he did n t see where at 
that time of day any such luxury was to come 
from. 

" You have n t kept one, as I told you ? " Mir 
iam demanded. 

" As you told me, my dear ? Tell the lamb to 
keep its tender mutton from the wolves ! " 

" You shall have one : we 11 arrange it," Mir 
iam went on, to Biddy. 

" Let me qualify that statement a little, Miss 
Dormer," said Basil Dashwood. " We 11 arrange 
it if it s humanly possible." 

"We ll arrange it even if it s inhumanly im- 



868  

possible that s just the point," Miriam declared 
to the girl. " Don t talk about trouble what s 
he meant for but to take it ? Cela sannonce 
bien&gt; you see," she continued, to Nick : "does n t 
it look as if we should pull beautifully together ? " 
And as he replied that he heartily congratulated 
her he was immensely interested in what he 
had been told she exclaimed, after resting her 
eyes on him a moment : " What will you have ? 
It seemed simpler! It was clear there had to be 
some one." She explained further to Nick, what 
had led her to come in at that moment, while 
Dashwood approached Biddy with civil assur 
ances that they would see, they would leave no 
stone unturned, though he would not have taken 
it upon himself to promise. 

Miriam reminded Nick of the blessing he had 
been to her nearly a year before, on her other 
first night, when she was fidgety and impatient : 
how he had let her come and sit there for hours 
- helped her to possess her sou 1 till the evening 
and keep out of harm s way. The case was the 
same at present, with the aggravation indeed 
that he would understand Dashwood s nerves 
as well as her own : they were a great deal worse 
than hers. Everything was ready for Juliet ; they 
had been rehearsing for five months (it had kept 
her from going mad, with the eternity of the 
other piece), and he had occurred to her again, 
in the last intolerable hours, as the friend in 
need, the salutary stop-gap, no matter how much 



 869 

she bothered him. She should n t be turned out ? 
Biddy broke away from Basil Dashwood : she 
must go, she must hurry off to Miss Tressilian 
with her news. Florence might make some 
other stupid engagement for the evening: she 
must be warned in time. The girl took a flushed, 
excited leave, after having received a renewal of 
Miriam s pledge and even heard her say to Nick 
that he must now give back the stall that had 
been sent him they would be sure to have an 
other use for it. 



LI. 

THAT night, at the theatre, in the box (the 
miracle had been wrought, the treasure was 
found), Nick Dormer pointed out to his two com 
panions the stall he had relinquished, which was 
close in front noting how oddly, during the 
whole of the first act, it remained vacant. The 
house was magnificent, the actress was magnifi 
cent. To describe again so famous an occasion 
(it has been described, repeatedly, by other re 
porters) is not in the compass of the closing 
words of a history already too sustained. It is 
enough to say that this great night marked an 
era in contemporary art, and that for those who 
had a spectator s share in it the word " triumph " 
acquired a new illustration. Miriam s Juliet was 
an exquisite image of young passion and young 
despair, expressed in the divinest, truest music 
that had ever poured from tragic lips. The great 
childish audience, gaping at her points, expanded 
there before her like a lap to catch flowers. 

During the first interval our three friends in 
the box had plenty to talk about, and they were 
so occupied with it that for some time they failed 
to observe that a gentleman had at last come into 
the empty stall near the front. This discovery 



 8/1 

was presently formulated by Miss Tressilian, in 
the cheerful exclamation : " Only fancy there s 
Mr. Sherringham ! " This of course immediately 
became a high wonder a wonder for Nick and 
Biddy, who had not heard of his return ; and the 
marvel was increased by the fact that he gave no 
sign of looking for them or even at them. Hav 
ing taken possession of his place he sat very still 
in it, staring straight before him at the curtain. 
His abrupt reappearance contained mystifying 
elements both for Biddy and for Nick, so that it 
was mainly Miss Tressilian who had freedom of 
mind to throw off the theory that he had come 
back that very hour had arrived from a long 
journey. Could n t they see how strange he was 
and how brown, how burnt and how red, how 
tired and how worn ? They all inspected him, 
though Biddy declined Miss Tressilian s glass ; 
but he was evidently unconscious of observation, 
and finally Biddy, leaning back in her chair, 
dropped the fantastic words : 

" He has come home to marry Juliet ! " 

Nick glanced at her ; then he replied : " What 
a disaster to make such a journey as that and 
to be late for the fair ! " 

" Late for the fair ? " 

" Why, she s married these three days. 
They did it very quietly ; Miriam says because 
her mother hated it and hopes it won t be much 
known ! All the same she s Basil Dashwood s 
wedded wife he has come in just in time to 



872  

take the receipts for Juliet. It s a good thing, no 
doubt, for there are at least two fortunes to be 
made out of her, and he 11 give up the stage." 
Nick explained to Miss Tressilian, who had in 
quired, that the gentleman in question was the 
actor who was playing Mercutio, and he asked 
Biddy if she had not known that this was what 
they were telling him, in Rosedale Road, in the 
morning. She replied that she had not under 
stood, and she sank considerably behind the dra 
pery of the box. From this cover she was able 
to launch, creditably enough, the exclamation : 

" Poor Peter ! " 

Nick got up and stood looking at poor Peter. 
" He ought to come round and speak to us, but 
if he does n t see us I suppose he does n t." 
Nick quitted the box as if to go to the restored 
exile. I may add that as soon as he had done so 
Florence Tressilian bounded over to the dusky 
corner in which Biddy had nestled. What passed 
immediately between these young ladies need not 
concern us : it is sufficient to mention that two 
minutes later Miss Tressilian broke out : 

" Look at him, dearest ; he s turning his head 
this way ! " 

" Thank you, I don t care to look at him," said 
Biddy ; and she doubtless demeaned herself in 
the high spirit of these words. It nevertheless 
happened that directly afterwards she became 
aware that he had glanced at his watch, as if to 
judge how soon the curtain would rise again, and 



 8/3 

then had jumped up and passed quickly out of 
his place. The curtain had risen again without 
his coming back and without Nick s reappearing 
in the box. Indeed by the time Nick slipped in 
a good deal of the third act was over ; and even 
then, even when the curtain descended, Peter 
Sherringham had not returned. Nick sat down 
in silence, to watch the stage, to which the breath 
less attention of his companions seemed to be 
attached, though Biddy, after a moment, threw 
back at him a single quick look. At the end of 
the act they were all occupied with the recalls, 
the applause and the responsive loveliness of Ju 
liet as she was led out (Mercutio had to give her 
up to Romeo), and even for a few minutes after 
the uproar had subsided nothing was said among 
the three. At last Nick began : 

" It s quite true, he has just arrived ; he s in 
Great Stanhope Street. They ve given him sev 
eral weeks, to make up for the uncomfortable way 
they bundled him off (to arrive in time for some 
special business that had suddenly to be gone 
into) when he first went out : he tells me they 
promised that at the time. He got into South 
ampton only a few hours ago, rushed up by the 
first train he could catch and came off here with 
out any dinner." 

" Fancy ! " said Miss Tressilian ; while Biddy 
asked if Peter might be in good health and had 
been happy. Nick replied that he said it was a 
beastly place, but he appeared all right. He was 



874 rHE TRAGIC MUSE. 

to be in England probably a month, he was aw 
fully brown, he sent his love to Biddy. Miss 
Tressilian looked at his empty stall and was of 
the opinion that it would be more to the point 
for him to come in to see her. 

" Oh, he 11 turn up ; we had a goodish talk in 
the lobby, where he met me. I think he went 
out somewhere." 

" How odd to come so many thousand miles 
for this, and then not to stay ! " Biddy reflected. 

" Did he come on purpose for this ? " Miss 
Tressilian asked. 

" Perhaps he s gone out to get his dinner ! " 
joked Biddy. 

Her friend suggested that he might be behind 
the scenes, but Nick expressed a doubt of this ; 
and Biddy asked her brother if he himself were 
not going round. At this moment the curtain 
rose ; Nick said he would go in the next interval. 
As soon as it came he quitted the box, remaining 
absent while it lasted. 

All this time, in the house, there was no sign 
of Peter. Nick reappeared only as the fourth act 
was beginning, and uttered no word to his com 
panions till it was over. Then, after a further 
delay produced by renewed evidences of the ac 
tress s victory, he described his visit to the stage 
and the wonderful spectacle of Miriam on the 
field of battle. Miss Tressilian inquired if he had 
found Mr. Sherringham with her ; to which he re 
plied that, save across the footlights, she had not 



 875 

seen him. At this a soft exclamation broke from 
Biddy : 

" Poor Peter ! Where is he, then ? " 

Nick hesitated a moment. " He s walking the 
streets." 

" Walking the streets ? " 

"I don t know I give it up!" Nick replied; 
and his tone, for some minutes, reduced his com 
panions to silence. But a little later Biddy said : 

"Was it for him, this morning, she wanted that 
place, when she asked you to give yours back ? " 

" For him, exactly. It s very odd that she just 
managed to keep it, for all the use he makes of 
it ! She told me just now that she heard from 
him, at his post, a short time ago, to the effect 
that he had seen in a newspaper a statement she 
was going to do Juliet, and that he firmly in 
tended, though the ways and means were not 
clear to him (his leave of absence had n t yet 
come out, and he could n t be sure when it would 
come), to be present on her first night : therefore 
she must do him the service to keep a seat for 
him. She thought this a speech rather in the 
air, so that in the midst of all her cares she took 
no particular pains about the matter. She had 
an idea she had really done with him for a long 
time. But this afternoon what does he do but 
telegraph to her from Southampton that he keeps 
his appointment and counts upon her for a stall ? 
Unless she had got back mine she would n t have 
been able to accommodate him. When she was in 



8/6  

Rosedale Road this morning she had n t received 
his telegram ; but his promise, his threat, what 
ever it was, came back to her ; she had a sort of 
foreboding and thought that on the chance she 
had better have something- ready. When she 
got home she found his telegram, and she told 
me that he was the first person she saw in the 
house, through her fright, when she came on in 
the second act. It appears she was terrified this 
time, and it lasted half through the play." 

"She must be rather annoyed at his having 
gone away," Miss Tressilian observed. 

" Annoyed ? I m not so sure !. " laughed Nick. 

" Ah, here he comes back ! " cried Biddy, be 
hind her fan, as the absentee edged into his seat 
in time for the fifth act. He stood there a mo 
ment, first looking round the theatre ; then he 
turned his eyes upon the box occupied by his 
relatives, smiling and waving his hand. 

" After that he 11 surely come and see you," 
said Miss Tressilian. 

" We shall see him as we go out," Biddy replied : 
" he must lose no more time." 

Nick looked at him with a glass ; then he ex 
claimed : " Well, I m glad he has pulled himself 
together ! " 

"Why, what s the matter with him, since he 
was n t disappointed in his seat ? " Miss Tressilian 
demanded. 

"The matter with him is that a couple of hours 
ago he had a great shock." 



 877 

" A great shock ? " 

" I may as well mention it at last," Nick went 
on. " I had to say something to him in the lobby 
there, when we met something I was pretty 
sure he could n t like. I let him have it full in 
the face it seemed to me better and wiser. I 
told him Juliet s married." 

" Did n t he know it ? " asked Biddy, who, with 
her face raised, had listened in deep stillness to 
every word that fell from her brother. 

" How should he have known it ? It has only 
just happened, and they ve been so clever, for 
reasons of their own (those people move among 
a lot of considerations that are absolutely foreign 
to us), about keeping it out of the papers. They 
put in a lot of lies and they leave out the real 
things." 

" You don t mean to say Mr. Sherringham 
wanted to marry her ! " Miss Tressilian ejacu 
lated. 

" Don t ask me what he wanted I dare say 
we shall never know. One thing is very certain : 
that he did n t like my news and that I sha n t 
soon forget the look in his face as he turned 
away from me, slipping out into the street. He 
was too much upset he could n t trust himself 
to come back ; he had to walk about he tried 
to walk it off." 

" Let us hope that he has walked it off ! " 

"Ah, poor fellow he couldn t hold out to 
the end ; he has had to come back and look at 



8/8  

her once more. He knows she 11 be sublime in 
these last scenes." 

" Is he so much in love with her as that ? 
What difference does it make, with an actress, 
if she is mar ? " But in this rash inquiry Miss 
Tressilian suddenly checked herself. 

"We shall probably never know how much he 
has been in love with her nor what difference 
it makes. We shall never know exactly what 
he came back for nor why he could n t stand it 
out there any longer without relief, nor why 
he scrambled down here all but straight from 
the station, nor why, after all, for the last two 
hours, he has been roaming the streets. And it 
does n t matter, for it s none of our business. 
But I m sorry for him she is going to be sub 
lime," Nick added. The curtain was rising on 
the tragic climax of the play. 

Miriam Rooth was sublime ; yet it may be con 
fided to the reader that during these supreme 
scenes Bridget Dormer directed her eyes less to 
the inspired actress than to a figure in the stalls 
who sat with his own gaze fastened to the stage. 
It may further be intimated that Peter Sher- 
ringham, though he saw but a fragment of the 
performance, read clear, at the last, in the in 
tense light of genius that this fragment shed, 
that even so, after all, he had been rewarded 
for his formidable journey. The great trouble of 
his infatuation subsided, leaving behind it some 
thing tolerably deep and pure. This assuage- 



 879 

ment was far from being immediate, but it was 
helped on, unexpectedly to him, it began to dawn, 
at least, the very next night he saw the play, 
when he sat through the whole of it. Then he 
felt somehow recalled to reality by the very per 
fection of the representation. He began to come 
back to it from a period of miserable madness. 
He had been baffled, he had got his answer; it 
must last him that was plain. He did n t fully 
accept it the first week or the second ; but he ac 
cepted it sooner than he would have supposed, 
had he known what it was to be when he paced 
at night, under the southern stars, the deck of 
the ship that was bringing him to England. 

It had been, as we know, Miss Tressilian s 
view, and even Biddy s, that evening, that Peter 
Sherringham would join them as they left the 
theatre. This view, however, was not confirmed 
by the event, for the gentleman in question van 
ished utterly (disappointingly crude behavior on 
the part of a young diplomatist who had distin 
guished himself), before any one could put a 
hand on him. And he failed to make up for his 
crudity by coming to see any one the next day, 
or even the next. Indeed many days elapsed, 
and very little would have been known about him 
had it not been that, in the country, Mrs. Dallow 
knew. What Mrs. Dallow knew was eventually 
known to Biddy Dormer; and in this way it 
could be established in his favor that he had re 
mained some extraordinarily small number of 



880  

days in London, had almost directly gone over 
to Paris to see his old chief. He came back 
from Paris Biddy knew this not from Mrs. 
Dallow, but in a much more immediate way : she 
knew it by his pressing the little electric button 
at the door of Florence Tressilian s flat, one day 
when the good Florence was out and she herself 
was at home. He made on this occasion a very 
long visit. The good Florence knew it not much 
later, you may be sure (and how he had got their 
address from Nick), and she took an extravagant 
satisfaction in it. Mr. Sherringham had never 
been to see her the like of her in his life: 
therefore it was clear what had made him begin. 
When he had once begun he kept it up, and Miss 
Tressilian s satisfaction increased. 

Good as she was, she could remember without 
the slightest relenting what Nick Dormer had re 
peated to them at the theatre about Peter s pres 
ent post s being a beastly place. However, she 
was not bound to make a stand at this if persons 
more nearly concerned, Lady Agnes and the 
girl herself, did n t mind it. How little they 
minded it, and Grace and Julia Dallow and even 
Nick, was proved in the course of a meeting that 
took place at Harsh during the Easter holidays. 
Mrs. Dallow had a small and intimate party to 
celebrate her brother s betrothal. The two ladies 
came over from Broadwood ; even Nick, for two 
days, went back to his old hunting-ground, and 
Miss Tressilian relinquished for as long a time 



 88 1 

the delights of her newly arranged flat. Peter 
Sherringham obtained an extension of leave, so 
that he might go back to his legation with a 
wife. Fortunately, as it turned out, Biddy s or 
deal, in the more or less torrid zone, was not 
cruelly prolonged, for the pair have already re 
ceived a superior appointment. It is Lady Ag- 
nes s proud opinion that her daughter is even 
now shaping their destiny. I say " even now," 
for these facts bring me very close to contempo 
rary history. During those two days at Harsh 
Nick arranged with Julia Dallow the conditions, 
as they might be called, under which she should 
sit to him ; and every one will remember in how 
recent an exhibition general attention was at 
tracted, as the newspapers said in describing the 
private view, to the noble portrait of a lady which 
was the final outcome of that arrangement. Ga 
briel Nash had been at many a private view, but 
he was not at that one. 

These matters are highly recent, however, as 
I say ; so that in glancing about the little circle 
of the interests I have tried to evoke I am sud 
denly warned by a sharp sense of modernness. 
This renders it difficult to me, for example, in 
taking leave of our wonderful Miriam, to do much 
more than allude to the general impression that 
her remarkable career is even yet only in its 
early prime. Basil Dashwood has got his theatre, 
and his wife (people know now she is his wife) 
has added three or four new parts to her reper- 



882  

tory ; but every one is agreed that both in public 
and in private she has a great deal more to show. 
This is equally true of Nick Dormer, in regard to 
whom I may finally say that his friend Nash s 
predictions about his reunion with Mrs. Dallow 
have not up to this time been justified. On the 
other hand, I must not omit to add, this lady has 
not, at the latest accounts, married Mr. Mac- 
george. It is very true there has been a rumor 
that Mr. Macgeorge is worried about her has 
even ceased to believe in her.
