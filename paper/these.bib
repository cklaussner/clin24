The goal of this paper is to dispel the magic behind this black box. This tutorial focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why principal component analysis works; furthermore, it crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind PCA . This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.}",

The main emphasis of that paper was not on the new procedure but on the broader consequences of our increasing sophistication in making such comparisons and the increasing (although never absolute) reliability of our inferences about authorship. My present objects, accordingly, are to give a more complete account of the procedure itself; to report the outcome of an extensive set of trials; and to consider the strengths and limitations of the new procedure. The procedure offers a simple but comparatively accurate addition to our current methods of distinguishing the most likely author of texts exceeding about 1,500 words in length. It is of even greater value as a method of reducing the field of likely candidates for texts of as little as 100 words in length. Not unexpectedly, it works least well with texts of a genre uncharacteristic of their author and, in one case, with texts far separated in time across a long literary career. Its possible use for other classificatory tasks has not yet been investigated. 10.1093/llc/17.3.267}",

@article{Hubert1985,
	abstract = "{The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.}",
