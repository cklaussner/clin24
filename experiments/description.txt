# results files:

all results files are structured the same:
load(file="file.rda") gives a variables 'diff'
> names(diff) 
[1] "cv"         "sim"        "inter.feat" "f1.red"     "f2.red"    
[6] "f1"         "f2" 


:each iteration result is indexed by the test doc that was removed in that iteration
: objects: are lists of different objects, either lists, vectors, matrices

#variables

#lists of matrices stating terms with respective RD score:
f1: complete feature list  for all iterations for first author in comparison, in this case Dickens and James are the first 
f2: complete feature list  for all iterations for second author in comparison, in this case Collins and Twain are the second
f1.red: reduced list according to threshold for first author (these are the ones actually used )
f2.red: reduced list according to threshold for second author (these are the ones actually used )

access like so: 

"diff$f1.red[[1]]"
or "diff$f1.red[["T-tsd"]]"



####################

#list of vectors 
inter.feat: shared features of f1.red and f2.red for each iteration

#list of lists
cv: cross-validation results, here only clustering, based on inter.feat of each iteration

#list of matrices
sim: similarity matrices corresponding to results for each iteration

access like this:

"diff$sim[[1]]"
